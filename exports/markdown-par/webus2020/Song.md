## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
<sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; <br>for your love is better than wine. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. <br>Your name is oil poured out, <br>therefore the virgins love you. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Take me away with you. <br>Let’s hurry. <br>The king has brought me into his rooms. <br>We will be glad and rejoice in you. <br>We will praise your love more than wine! <br>They are right to love you. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I am dark, but lovely, <br>you daughters of Jerusalem, <br>like Kedar’s tents, <br>like Solomon’s curtains. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t stare at me because I am dark, <br>because the sun has scorched me. <br>My mother’s sons were angry with me. <br>They made me keeper of the vineyards. <br>I haven’t kept my own vineyard. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Tell me, you whom my soul loves, <br>where you graze your flock, <br>where you rest them at noon; <br>for why should I be as one who is veiled <br>beside the flocks of your companions?
<sup>8</sup> If you don’t know, most beautiful among women, <br>follow the tracks of the sheep. <br>Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.

<sup>9</sup> I have compared you, my love, <br>to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, <br>your neck with strings of jewels.
<sup>11</sup> We will make you earrings of gold, <br>with studs of silver.
<sup>12</sup> While the king sat at his table, <br>my perfume spread its fragrance. <br>
<sup>13</sup> My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, <br>that lies between my breasts. <br>
<sup>14</sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms <br>from the vineyards of En Gedi.
<sup>15</sup> Behold,<sup>a</sup> you are beautiful, my love. <br>Behold, you are beautiful. <br>Your eyes are like doves.
<sup>16</sup> Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; <br>and our couch is verdant.
<sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars. <br>Our rafters are firs.

> - <sup>a</sup> 15. “Behold”, from “[hebrew]הִנֵּה[/hebrew]”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon, <br>a lily of the valleys.
<sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns, <br>so is my love among the daughters.
<sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, <br>so is my beloved among the sons. <br>I sat down under his shadow with great delight, <br>his fruit was sweet to my taste. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banquet hall. <br>His banner over me is love. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Strengthen me with raisins, <br>refresh me with apples; <br>for I am faint with love. <br>
<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head. <br>His right hand embraces me. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, <br>by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, <br>that you not stir up, nor awaken love, <br>until it so desires.

<sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! <br>Behold, he comes, <br>leaping on the mountains, <br>skipping on the hills. <br>
<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. <br>Behold, he stands behind our wall! <br>He looks in at the windows. <br>He glances through the lattice.

<sup>10</sup> My beloved spoke, and said to me, <br>“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For behold, the winter is past. <br>The rain is over and gone. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth. <br>The time of the singing has come, <br>and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The fig tree ripens her green figs. <br>The vines are in blossom. <br>They give out their fragrance. <br>Arise, my love, my beautiful one, <br>and come away.”
<sup>14</sup> My dove in the clefts of the rock, <br>in the hiding places of the mountainside, <br>let me see your face. <br>Let me hear your voice; <br>for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Catch for us the foxes, <br>the little foxes that plunder the vineyards; <br>for our vineyards are in blossom.
<sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his. <br>He browses among the lilies. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, <br>turn, my beloved, <br>and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> By night on my bed, <br>I sought him whom my soul loves. <br>I sought him, but I didn’t find him. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will get up now, and go about the city; <br>in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves. <br>I sought him, but I didn’t find him. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me; <br>“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?” <br>
<sup>4</sup> I had scarcely passed from them, <br>when I found him whom my soul loves. <br>I held him, and would not let him go, <br>until I had brought him into my mother’s house, <br>into the room of her who conceived me.

<sup>5</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, <br>by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, <br>that you not stir up nor awaken love, <br>until it so desires.

<sup>6</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, <br>perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, <br>with all spices of the merchant? <br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage! <br>Sixty mighty men are around it, <br>of the mighty men of Israel. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They all handle the sword, and are expert in war. <br>Every man has his sword on his thigh, <br>because of fear in the night.

<sup>9</sup> King Solomon made himself a carriage <br>of the wood of Lebanon. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He made its pillars of silver, <br>its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, <br>the middle of it being paved with love, <br>from the daughters of Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon, <br>with the crown with which his mother has crowned him, <br>in the day of his weddings, <br>in the day of the gladness of his heart.
## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Behold, you are beautiful, my love. <br>Behold, you are beautiful. <br>Your eyes are like doves behind your veil. <br>Your hair is as a flock of goats, <br>that descend from Mount Gilead. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, <br>which have come up from the washing, <br>where every one of them has twins. <br>None is bereaved among them. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Your lips are like scarlet thread. <br>Your mouth is lovely. <br>Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armory, <br>on which a thousand shields hang, <br>all the shields of the mighty men. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns <br>that are twins of a roe, <br>which feed among the lilies.

<sup>6</sup> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, <br>I will go to the mountain of myrrh, <br>to the hill of frankincense.

<sup>7</sup> You are all beautiful, my love. <br>There is no spot in you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, <br>with me from Lebanon. <br>Look from the top of Amana, <br>from the top of Senir and Hermon, <br>from the lions’ dens, <br>from the mountains of the leopards.

<sup>9</sup> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. <br>You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, <br>with one chain of your neck. <br>
<sup>10</sup> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! <br>How much better is your love than wine, <br>the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices! <br>
<sup>11</sup> Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb. <br>Honey and milk are under your tongue. <br>The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon. <br>
<sup>12</sup> My sister, my bride, is a locked up garden; <br>a locked up spring, <br>a sealed fountain. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits, <br>henna with spikenard plants, <br>
<sup>14</sup> spikenard and saffron, <br>calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; <br>myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices, <br>
<sup>15</sup> a fountain of gardens, <br>a well of living waters, <br>flowing streams from Lebanon.
<sup>16</sup> Awake, north wind, and come, you south! <br>Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. <br>Let my beloved come into his garden, <br>and taste his precious fruits.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. <br>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; <br>I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; <br>I have drunk my wine with my milk. <br>Eat, friends! <br>Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
<sup>2</sup> I was asleep, but my heart was awake. <br>It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: <br>“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; <br>for my head is filled with dew, <br>and my hair with the dampness of the night.” <br>
<sup>3</sup> I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? <br>I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? <br>
<sup>4</sup> My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. <br>My heart pounded for him. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I rose up to open for my beloved. <br>My hands dripped with myrrh, <br>my fingers with liquid myrrh, <br>on the handles of the lock. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved; <br>but my beloved left, and had gone away. <br>My heart went out when he spoke. <br>I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. <br>I called him, but he didn’t answer. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me. <br>They beat me. <br>They bruised me. <br>The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.

<sup>8</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, <br>If you find my beloved, <br>that you tell him that I am faint with love.
<sup>9</sup> How is your beloved better than another beloved, <br>you fairest among women? <br>How is your beloved better than another beloved, <br>that you do so adjure us?
<sup>10</sup> My beloved is white and ruddy. <br>The best among ten thousand. <br>
<sup>11</sup> His head is like the purest gold. <br>His hair is bushy, black as a raven. <br>
<sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, <br>washed with milk, mounted like jewels. <br>
<sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. <br>His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. <br>
<sup>14</sup> His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. <br>His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. <br>
<sup>15</sup> His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. <br>His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. <br>
<sup>16</sup> His mouth is sweetness; <br>yes, he is altogether lovely. <br>This is my beloved, and this is my friend, <br>daughters of Jerusalem.
## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? <br>Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
<sup>2</sup> My beloved has gone down to his garden, <br>to the beds of spices, <br>to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. <br>He browses among the lilies.

<sup>4</sup> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, <br>lovely as Jerusalem, <br>awesome as an army with banners. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Turn away your eyes from me, <br>for they have overcome me. <br>Your hair is like a flock of goats, <br>that lie along the side of Gilead. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, <br>which have come up from the washing, <br>of which every one has twins; <br>not one is bereaved among them. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.

<sup>8</sup> There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, <br>and virgins without number. <br>
<sup>9</sup> My dove, my perfect one, is unique. <br>She is her mother’s only daughter. <br>She is the favorite one of her who bore her. <br>The daughters saw her, and called her blessed. <br>The queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.

<sup>10</sup> Who is she who looks out as the morning, <br>beautiful as the moon, <br>clear as the sun, <br>and awesome as an army with banners?

<sup>11</sup> I went down into the nut tree grove, <br>to see the green plants of the valley, <br>to see whether the vine budded, <br>and the pomegranates were in flower. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Without realizing it, <br>my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.
<sup>13</sup> Return, return, Shulammite! <br>Return, return, that we may gaze at you. <br>Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, <br>as at the dance of Mahanaim?
## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter! <br>Your rounded thighs are like jewels, <br>the work of the hands of a skillful workman. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Your body is like a round goblet, <br>no mixed wine is wanting. <br>Your waist is like a heap of wheat, <br>set about with lilies. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, <br>that are twins of a roe. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like an ivory tower. <br>Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. <br>Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Your head on you is like Carmel. <br>The hair of your head like purple. <br>The king is held captive in its tresses. <br>
<sup>6</sup> How beautiful and how pleasant you are, <br>love, for delights! <br>
<sup>7</sup> This, your stature, is like a palm tree, <br>your breasts like its fruit. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree. <br>I will take hold of its fruit.” <br>Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, <br>the smell of your breath like apples. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Your mouth is like the best wine, <br>that goes down smoothly for my beloved, <br>gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
<sup>10</sup> I am my beloved’s. <br>His desire is toward me. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field. <br>Let’s lodge in the villages. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Let’s go early up to the vineyards. <br>Let’s see whether the vine has budded, <br>its blossom is open, <br>and the pomegranates are in flower. <br>There I will give you my love. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The mandrakes produce fragrance. <br>At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, <br>which I have stored up for you, my beloved.
## Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Oh that you were like my brother, <br>who nursed from the breasts of my mother! <br>If I found you outside, I would kiss you; <br>yes, and no one would despise me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother, <br>who would instruct me. <br>I would have you drink spiced wine, <br>of the juice of my pomegranate. <br>
<sup>3</sup> His left hand would be under my head. <br>His right hand would embrace me.

<sup>4</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, <br>that you not stir up, nor awaken love, <br>until it so desires.
<sup>5</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, <br>leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. <br>There your mother conceived you. <br>There she was in labor and bore you.

<sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal on your heart, <br>as a seal on your arm; <br>for love is strong as death. <br>Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>Its flashes are flashes of fire, <br>a very flame of Yah.<sup>b</sup> <br>
<sup>7</sup> Many waters can’t quench love, <br>neither can floods drown it. <br>If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, <br>he would be utterly scorned.
<sup>8</sup> We have a little sister. <br>She has no breasts. <br>What shall we do for our sister <br>in the day when she is to be spoken for?

<sup>9</sup> If she is a wall, <br>we will build on her a turret of silver. <br>If she is a door, <br>we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
<sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, <br>then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. <br>He leased out the vineyard to keepers. <br>Each was to bring a thousand shekels<sup>c</sup> of silver for its fruit. <br>
<sup>12</sup> My own vineyard is before me. <br>The thousand are for you, Solomon, <br>two hundred for those who tend its fruit.
<sup>13</sup> You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, <br>let me hear your voice!
<sup>14</sup> Come away, my beloved! <br>Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!

> - <sup>a</sup> 6. Sheol is the place of the dead.
> - <sup>b</sup> 6. “Yah” is a short form of “Yahweh”, which is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
> - <sup>c</sup> 11. A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 1000 shekels is about 10 kilograms or about 22 pounds.
