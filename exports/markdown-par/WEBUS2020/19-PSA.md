## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br>nor stand on the path of sinners,<br>nor sit in the seat of scoffers;<br>
<sup>2</sup> but his delight is in Yahweh’s<sup>a</sup> law.<br>On his law he meditates day and night.<br>
<sup>3</sup> He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br>that produces its fruit in its season,<br>whose leaf also does not wither.<br>Whatever he does shall prosper.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so,<br>but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br>nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,<br>but the way of the wicked shall perish.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage,<br>and the peoples plot a vain thing?<br>
<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take a stand,<br>and the rulers take counsel together,<br>against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,<sup>a</sup> saying,<br>
<sup>3</sup> “Let’s break their bonds apart,<br>and cast their cords from us.”<br>
<sup>4</sup> He who sits in the heavens will laugh.<br>The Lord<sup>b</sup> will have them in derision.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Then he will speak to them in his anger,<br>and terrify them in his wrath:<br>
<sup>6</sup> “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”<br>
<sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree:<br>Yahweh said to me, “You are my son.<br>Today I have become your father.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,<br>the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You shall break them with a rod of iron.<br>You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”<br>
<sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, you kings.<br>Be instructed, you judges of the earth.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Serve Yahweh with fear,<br>and rejoice with trembling.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Give sincere homage to the Son,<sup>c</sup> lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,<br>for his wrath will soon be kindled.<br>Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

<sup>5</sup> The arrogant will not stand in your sight.<br>You hate all workers of iniquity.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You will destroy those who speak lies.<br>Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.<br>I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies.<br>Make your way straight before my face.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.<br>Their heart is destruction.<br>Their throat is an open tomb.<br>They flatter with their tongue.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, God.<br>Let them fall by their own counsels.<br>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,<br>for they have rebelled against you.<br>
<sup>11</sup> But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.<br>Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.<br>Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.<br>

<sup>3</sup> My soul is also in great anguish.<br>But you, Yahweh—how long?<br>

## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you.<br>Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,<br>

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,<br>if there is iniquity in my hands,<br>
<sup>4</sup> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me<br>(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),<br>

<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge,<br>yes, a God who has indignation every day.<br>
<sup>12</sup> If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;<br>he has bent and strung his bow.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.<br>He makes ready his flaming arrows.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Behold,<sup>a</sup> he travails with iniquity.<br>Yes, he has conceived mischief,<br>and brought out falsehood.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole,<br>and has fallen into the pit which he made.<br>
<sup>16</sup> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.<br>His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.<br>

<sup>3</sup> When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br>the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,<br>
<sup>4</sup> what is man, that you think of him?<br>What is the son of man, that you care for him?<br>

<sup>6</sup> You make him ruler over the works of your hands.<br>You have put all things under his feet:<br>
<sup>7</sup> All sheep and cattle,<br>yes, and the animals of the field,<br>
<sup>8</sup> the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,<br>and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.<br>

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you.<br>I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.<br>
<sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back,<br>they stumble and perish in your presence.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For you have maintained my just cause.<br>You sit on the throne judging righteously.<br>
<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations.<br>You have destroyed the wicked.<br>You have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.<br>The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But Yahweh reigns forever.<br>He has prepared his throne for judgment.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He will judge the world in righteousness.<br>He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed;<br>a high tower in times of trouble.<br>

<sup>14</sup> that I may show all of your praise.<br>I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.<br>

## Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?<br>Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?<br>
<sup>2</sup> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.<br>They are caught in the schemes that they devise.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.<br>He blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his face,<br>has no room in his thoughts for God.<br>
<sup>5</sup> His ways are prosperous at all times.<br>He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight.<br>As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.<br>For generations I shall have no trouble.”<br>
<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.<br>Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages.<br>From ambushes, he murders the innocent.<br>His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.<br>He lies in wait to catch the helpless.<br>He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The helpless are crushed.<br>They collapse.<br>They fall under his strength.<br>
<sup>11</sup> He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.<br>He hides his face.<br>He will never see it.”

<sup>12</sup> Arise, Yahweh!<br>God, lift up your hand!<br>Don’t forget the helpless.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked person condemn God,<br>and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”?<br>
<sup>14</sup> But you do see trouble and grief.<br>You consider it to take it into your hand.<br>You help the victim and the fatherless.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked.<br>As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh is King forever and ever!<br>The nations will perish out of his land.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble.<br>You will prepare their heart.<br>You will cause your ear to hear,<br>
<sup>18</sup> to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,<br>that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
## Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> In Yahweh, I take refuge.<br>How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?<br>
<sup>2</sup> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.<br>They set their arrows on the strings,<br>that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.<br>
<sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed,<br>what can the righteous do?<br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is in his holy temple.<br>Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.<br>His eyes observe.<br>His eyes examine the children of men.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh examines the righteous,<br>but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.<br>
<sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;<br>fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For Yahweh is righteous.<br>He loves righteousness.<br>The upright shall see his face.
## Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.<br>For the faithful fail from among the children of men.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Everyone lies to his neighbor.<br>They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.<br>
<sup>3</sup> May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,<br>and the tongue that boasts,<br>
<sup>4</sup> who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.<br>Our lips are our own.<br>Who is lord over us?”<br>
<sup>5</sup> “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,<br>I will now arise,” says Yahweh;<br>“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”<br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh’s words are flawless words,<br>as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You will keep them, Yahweh.<br>You will preserve them from this generation forever.<br>
<sup>8</sup> The wicked walk on every side,<br>when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
## Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> How long, Yahweh?<br>Will you forget me forever?<br>How long will you hide your face from me?<br>
<sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,<br>having sorrow in my heart every day?<br>How long shall my enemy triumph over me?<br>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.<br>Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;<br>
<sup>4</sup> lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”<br>lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.

<sup>5</sup> But I trust in your loving kindness.<br>My heart rejoices in your salvation.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I will sing to Yahweh,<br>because he has been good to me.
## Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>They are corrupt.<br>They have done abominable deeds.<br>There is no one who does good.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,<br>to see if there were any who understood,<br>who sought after God.<br>
<sup>3</sup> They have all gone aside.<br>They have together become corrupt.<br>There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br>who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br>and don’t call on Yahweh?<br>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear,<br>for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You frustrate the plan of the poor,<br>because Yahweh is his refuge.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br>When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,<br>then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
## Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?<br>Who shall live on your holy hill?<br>
<sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,<br>and speaks truth in his heart;<br>
<sup>3</sup> he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,<br>nor does evil to his friend,<br>nor casts slurs against his fellow man;<br>
<sup>4</sup> in whose eyes a vile man is despised,<br>but who honors those who fear Yahweh;<br>he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;<br>
<sup>5</sup> he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,<br>nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
## Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.<br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord.<br>Apart from you I have no good thing.”<br>
<sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth,<br>they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.

<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.<br>Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,<br>nor take their names on my lips.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.<br>You made my lot secure.

<sup>6</sup> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.<br>Yes, I have a good inheritance.<br>
<sup>7</sup> I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel.<br>Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I have set Yahweh always before me.<br>Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.<br>My body shall also dwell in safety.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<sup>a</sup><br>neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.<br>
<sup>11</sup> You will show me the path of life.<br>In your presence is fullness of joy.<br>In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.

## Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea.<br>Give ear to my prayer that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come out of your presence.<br>Let your eyes look on equity.<br>
<sup>3</sup> You have proved my heart.<br>You have visited me in the night.<br>You have tried me, and found nothing.<br>I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.<br>
<sup>4</sup> As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,<br>I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.<br>
<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to your paths.<br>My feet have not slipped.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.<br>Turn your ear to me.<br>Hear my speech.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Show your marvelous loving kindness,<br>you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of your eye.<br>Hide me under the shadow of your wings,<br>
<sup>9</sup> from the wicked who oppress me,<br>my deadly enemies, who surround me.<br>
<sup>10</sup> They close up their callous hearts.<br>With their mouth they speak proudly.<br>
<sup>11</sup> They have now surrounded us in our steps.<br>They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.<br>
<sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,<br>as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Arise, Yahweh, confront him.<br>Cast him down.<br>Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,<br>
<sup>14</sup> from men by your hand, Yahweh,<br>from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.<br>You fill the belly of your cherished ones.<br>Your sons have plenty,<br>and they store up wealth for their children.<br>
<sup>15</sup> As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.<br>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
## Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> I love you, Yahweh, my strength.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;<br>my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br>my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.<br>
<sup>3</sup> I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;<br>and I am saved from my enemies.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The cords of death surrounded me.<br>The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The cords of Sheol<sup>a</sup> were around me.<br>The snares of death came on me.<br>
<sup>6</sup> In my distress I called on Yahweh,<br>and cried to my God.<br>He heard my voice out of his temple.<br>My cry before him came into his ears.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled.<br>The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,<br>because he was angry.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Smoke went out of his nostrils.<br>Consuming fire came out of his mouth.<br>Coals were kindled by it.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.<br>Thick darkness was under his feet.<br>
<sup>10</sup> He rode on a cherub, and flew.<br>Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.<br>
<sup>11</sup> He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,<br>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<br>
<sup>12</sup> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,<br>hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Yahweh also thundered in the sky.<br>The Most High uttered his voice:<br>hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
<sup>14</sup> He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.<br>He routed them with great lightning bolts.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Then the channels of waters appeared.<br>The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh,<br>at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.<br>
<sup>16</sup> He sent from on high.<br>He took me.<br>He drew me out of many waters.<br>
<sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br>from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.<br>
<sup>18</sup> They came on me in the day of my calamity,<br>but Yahweh was my support.<br>
<sup>19</sup> He brought me out also into a large place.<br>He delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.<br>According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.<br>
<sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,<br>and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>
<sup>22</sup> For all his ordinances were before me.<br>I didn’t put away his statutes from me.<br>
<sup>23</sup> I was also blameless with him.<br>I kept myself from my iniquity.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,<br>according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br>
<sup>25</sup> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.<br>With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.<br>
<sup>26</sup> With the pure, you will show yourself pure.<br>With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.<br>
<sup>27</sup> For you will save the afflicted people,<br>but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.<br>
<sup>28</sup> For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.<br>My God will light up my darkness.<br>
<sup>29</sup> For by you, I advance through a troop.<br>By my God, I leap over a wall.<br>
<sup>30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect.<br>Yahweh’s word is tried.<br>He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.<br>
<sup>31</sup> For who is God, except Yahweh?<br>Who is a rock, besides our God,<br>
<sup>32</sup> the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?<br>
<sup>33</sup> He makes my feet like deer’s feet,<br>and sets me on my high places.<br>
<sup>34</sup> He teaches my hands to war,<br>so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.<br>
<sup>35</sup> You have also given me the shield of your salvation.<br>Your right hand sustains me.<br>Your gentleness has made me great.<br>
<sup>36</sup> You have enlarged my steps under me,<br>My feet have not slipped.<br>
<sup>37</sup> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.<br>I won’t turn away until they are consumed.<br>
<sup>38</sup> I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.<br>They shall fall under my feet.<br>
<sup>39</sup> For you have armed me with strength to the battle.<br>You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.<br>
<sup>40</sup> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,<br>that I might cut off those who hate me.<br>
<sup>41</sup> They cried, but there was no one to save;<br>even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.<br>
<sup>42</sup> Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.<br>I cast them out as the mire of the streets.<br>
<sup>43</sup> You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.<br>You have made me the head of the nations.<br>A people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br>
<sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.<br>The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.<br>
<sup>45</sup> The foreigners shall fade away,<br>and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.<br>
<sup>46</sup> Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock.<br>Exalted be the God of my salvation,<br>
<sup>47</sup> even the God who executes vengeance for me,<br>and subdues peoples under me.<br>
<sup>48</sup> He rescues me from my enemies.<br>Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.<br>You deliver me from the violent man.<br>

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.<br>Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.<br>Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.<br>
<sup>10</sup> They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,<br>sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Moreover your servant is warned by them.<br>In keeping them there is great reward.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Who can discern his errors?<br>Forgive me from hidden errors.

<sup>13</sup> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.<br>Let them not have dominion over me.<br>Then I will be upright.<br>I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>be acceptable in your sight,<br>Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
## Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble.<br>May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,<br>
<sup>2</sup> send you help from the sanctuary,<br>grant you support from Zion,<br>
<sup>3</sup> remember all your offerings,<br>and accept your burned sacrifice.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> May he grant you your heart’s desire,<br>and fulfill all your counsel.<br>
<sup>5</sup> We will triumph in your salvation.<br>In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.<br>May Yahweh grant all your requests.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.<br>He will answer him from his holy heaven,<br>with the saving strength of his right hand.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,<br>but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They are bowed down and fallen,<br>but we rise up, and stand upright.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Save, Yahweh!<br>Let the King answer us when we call!
## Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king rejoices in your strength, Yahweh!<br>How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!<br>
<sup>2</sup> You have given him his heart’s desire,<br>and have not withheld the request of his lips.<br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.<br>You set a crown of fine gold on his head.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He asked life of you and you gave it to him,<br>even length of days forever and ever.<br>
<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation.<br>You lay honor and majesty on him.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For you make him most blessed forever.<br>You make him glad with joy in your presence.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in Yahweh.<br>Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Your hand will find out all of your enemies.<br>Your right hand will find out those who hate you.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.<br>Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath.<br>The fire shall devour them.<br>
<sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth,<br>their posterity from among the children of men.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against you.<br>They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For you will make them turn their back,<br>when you aim drawn bows at their face.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength,<br>so we will sing and praise your power.
## Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<br>Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?<br>
<sup>2</sup> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;<br>in the night season, and am not silent.<br>
<sup>3</sup> But you are holy,<br>you who inhabit the praises of Israel.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in you.<br>They trusted, and you delivered them.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They cried to you, and were delivered.<br>They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.<br>
<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man;<br>a reproach of men, and despised by the people.<br>
<sup>7</sup> All those who see me mock me.<br>They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,<br>
<sup>8</sup> “He trusts in Yahweh.<br>Let him deliver him.<br>Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> But you brought me out of the womb.<br>You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.<br>
<sup>10</sup> I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.<br>You are my God since my mother bore me.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.<br>For there is no one to help.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded me.<br>Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.<br>
<sup>13</sup> They open their mouths wide against me,<br>lions tearing prey and roaring.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water.<br>All my bones are out of joint.<br>My heart is like wax.<br>It is melted within me.<br>
<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd.<br>My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.<br>You have brought me into the dust of death.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me.<br>A company of evildoers have enclosed me.<br>They have pierced my hands and feet.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>17</sup> I can count all of my bones.<br>They look and stare at me.<br>
<sup>18</sup> They divide my garments among them.<br>They cast lots for my clothing.

<sup>19</sup> But don’t be far off, Yahweh.<br>You are my help. Hurry to help me!<br>
<sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword,<br>my precious life from the power of the dog.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion’s mouth!<br>Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.

<sup>22</sup> I will declare your name to my brothers.<br>Among the assembly, I will praise you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> You who fear Yahweh, praise him!<br>All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!<br>Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!<br>
<sup>24</sup> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,<br>neither has he hidden his face from him;<br>but when he cried to him, he heard.

<sup>25</sup> My praise of you comes in the great assembly.<br>I will pay my vows before those who fear him.<br>
<sup>26</sup> The humble shall eat and be satisfied.<br>They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.<br>Let your hearts live forever.<br>
<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.<br>All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.<br>
<sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is Yahweh’s.<br>He is the ruler over the nations.<br>
<sup>29</sup> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.<br>All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,<br>even he who can’t keep his soul alive.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Posterity shall serve him.<br>Future generations shall be told about the Lord.<br>
<sup>31</sup> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,<br>for he has done it.

<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me<br>in the presence of my enemies.<br>You anoint my head with oil.<br>My cup runs over.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,<br>and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
## Chapter 24

<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory?<br>Yahweh strong and mighty,<br>Yahweh mighty in battle.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates;<br>yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,<br>and the King of glory will come in.<br>

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,<br>for they are from old times.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.<br>Remember me according to your loving kindness,<br>for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is Yahweh,<br>therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He will guide the humble in justice.<br>He will teach the humble his way.<br>
<sup>10</sup> All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth<br>to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For your name’s sake, Yahweh,<br>pardon my iniquity, for it is great.<br>
<sup>12</sup> What man is he who fears Yahweh?<br>He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.<br>
<sup>13</sup> His soul will dwell at ease.<br>His offspring will inherit the land.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him.<br>He will show them his covenant.

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on Yahweh,<br>for he will pluck my feet out of the net.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br>for I am desolate and afflicted.<br>
<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged.<br>Oh bring me out of my distresses.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and my travail.<br>Forgive all my sins.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many.<br>They hate me with cruel hatred.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.<br>Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,<br>for I wait for you.<br>

## Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.<br>I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.<br>Try my heart and my mind.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For your loving kindness is before my eyes.<br>I have walked in your truth.<br>
<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with deceitful men,<br>neither will I go in with hypocrites.<br>
<sup>5</sup> I hate the assembly of evildoers,<br>and will not sit with the wicked.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I will wash my hands in innocence,<br>so I will go about your altar, Yahweh,<br>
<sup>7</sup> that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard<br>and tell of all your wondrous deeds.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house,<br>the place where your glory dwells.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t gather my soul with sinners,<br>nor my life with bloodthirsty men<br>
<sup>10</sup> in whose hands is wickedness;<br>their right hand is full of bribes.

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.<br>Redeem me, and be merciful to me.<br>

## Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh is my light and my salvation.<br>Whom shall I fear?<br>Yahweh is the strength of my life.<br>Of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
<sup>2</sup> When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,<br>even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Though an army should encamp against me,<br>my heart shall not fear.<br>Though war should rise against me,<br>even then I will be confident.<br>
<sup>4</sup> One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after:<br>that I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life,<br>to see Yahweh’s beauty,<br>and to inquire in his temple.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.<br>In the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me.<br>He will lift me up on a rock.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.<br>I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.<br>I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.

<sup>7</sup> Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.<br>Have mercy also on me, and answer me.<br>
<sup>8</sup> When you said, “Seek my face,”<br>my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t hide your face from me.<br>Don’t put your servant away in anger.<br>You have been my help.<br>Don’t abandon me,<br>neither forsake me, God of my salvation.<br>
<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me,<br>then Yahweh will take me up.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh.<br>Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,<br>for false witnesses have risen up against me,<br>such as breathe out cruelty.<br>
<sup>13</sup> I am still confident of this:<br>I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Wait for Yahweh.<br>Be strong, and let your heart take courage.<br>Yes, wait for Yahweh.
## Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, I call.<br>My rock, don’t be deaf to me,<br>lest, if you are silent to me,<br>I would become like those who go down into the pit.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you,<br>when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t draw me away with the wicked,<br>with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,<br>but mischief is in their hearts.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings.<br>Give them according to the operation of their hands.<br>Bring back on them what they deserve.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Because they don’t respect the works of Yahweh,<br>nor the operation of his hands,<br>he will break them down and not build them up.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh,<br>because he has heard the voice of my petitions.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh is my strength and my shield.<br>My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.<br>Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.<br>With my song I will thank him.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is their strength.<br>He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.<br>

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness.<br>Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve,<br>and strips the forests bare.<br>In his temple everything says, “Glory!”

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood.<br>Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh will give strength to his people.<br>Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
## Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up,<br>and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh my God, I cried to you,<br>and you have healed me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his.<br>Give thanks to his holy name.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment.<br>His favor is for a lifetime.<br>Weeping may stay for the night,<br>but joy comes in the morning.<br>
<sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity,<br>“I shall never be moved.”<br>
<sup>7</sup> You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong;<br>but when you hid your face, I was troubled.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh.<br>I made supplication to the Lord:<br>
<sup>9</sup> “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?<br>Shall the dust praise you?<br>Shall it declare your truth?<br>
<sup>10</sup> Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me.<br>Yahweh, be my helper.”<br>
<sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.<br>You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,<br>
<sup>12</sup> to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.<br>Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

<sup>2</sup> Bow down your ear to me.<br>Deliver me speedily.<br>Be to me a strong rock,<br>a house of defense to save me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For you are my rock and my fortress,<br>therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,<br>for you are my stronghold.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Into your hand I commend my spirit.<br>You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I hate those who regard lying vanities,<br>but I trust in Yahweh.<br>
<sup>7</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,<br>for you have seen my affliction.<br>You have known my soul in adversities.<br>
<sup>8</sup> You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.<br>You have set my feet in a large place.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.<br>My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For my life is spent with sorrow,<br>my years with sighing.<br>My strength fails because of my iniquity.<br>My bones are wasted away.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,<br>a horror to my acquaintances.<br>Those who saw me on the street fled from me.<br>
<sup>12</sup> I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.<br>I am like broken pottery.<br>
<sup>13</sup> For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,<br>while they conspire together against me,<br>they plot to take away my life.<br>
<sup>14</sup> But I trust in you, Yahweh.<br>I said, “You are my God.”<br>
<sup>15</sup> My times are in your hand.<br>Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Make your face to shine on your servant.<br>Save me in your loving kindness.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you.<br>Let the wicked be disappointed.<br>Let them be silent in Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>18</sup> Let the lying lips be mute,<br>which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Oh how great is your goodness,<br>which you have laid up for those who fear you,<br>which you have worked for those who take refuge in you,<br>before the sons of men!<br>
<sup>20</sup> In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man.<br>You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Praise be to Yahweh,<br>for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.<br>
<sup>22</sup> As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.”<br>Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints!<br>Yahweh preserves the faithful,<br>and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.<br>

<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity,<br>in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br>
<sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me.<br>My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to you.<br>I didn’t hide my iniquity.<br>I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,<br>and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.<br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.<br>Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place.<br>You will preserve me from trouble.<br>You will surround me with songs of deliverance.<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.<br>I will counsel you with my eye on you.<br>

<sup>18</sup> Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him,<br>on those who hope in his loving kindness,<br>
<sup>19</sup> to deliver their soul from death,<br>to keep them alive in famine.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Our soul has waited for Yahweh.<br>He is our help and our shield.<br>

<sup>20</sup> He protects all of his bones.<br>Not one of them is broken.<br>

<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler,<br>and stand up for my help.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.<br>Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”<br>
<sup>4</sup> Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.<br>Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind,<br>Yahweh’s angel driving them on.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery,<br>Yahweh’s angel pursuing them.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.<br>Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Let destruction come on him unawares.<br>Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.<br>Let him fall into that destruction.

<sup>9</sup> My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh.<br>It shall rejoice in his salvation.<br>
<sup>10</sup> All my bones shall say, “Yahweh, who is like you,<br>who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;<br>yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”<br>
<sup>11</sup> Unrighteous witnesses rise up.<br>They ask me about things that I don’t know about.<br>
<sup>12</sup> They reward me evil for good,<br>to the bereaving of my soul.

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.<br>I afflicted my soul with fasting.<br>My prayer returned into my own bosom.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.<br>I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.<br>
<sup>15</sup> But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.<br>The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.<br>They tore at me, and didn’t cease.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Like the profane mockers in feasts,<br>they gnashed their teeth at me.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Lord, how long will you look on?<br>Rescue my soul from their destruction,<br>my precious life from the lions.<br>
<sup>18</sup> I will give you thanks in the great assembly.<br>I will praise you among many people.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;<br>neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.<br>
<sup>20</sup> For they don’t speak peace,<br>but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.<br>They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”<br>
<sup>22</sup> You have seen it, Yahweh. Don’t keep silent.<br>Lord, don’t be far from me.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!<br>My Lord, contend for me!<br>
<sup>24</sup> Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness.<br>Don’t let them gloat over me.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”<br>Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”<br>
<sup>26</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity.<br>Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.

<sup>27</sup> Let those who favor my righteous cause shout for joy and be glad.<br>Yes, let them say continually, “May Yahweh be magnified,<br>who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”<br>
<sup>28</sup> My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
## Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:<br>There is no fear of God before his eyes.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes,<br>too much to detect and hate his sin.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.<br>He has ceased to be wise and to do good.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He plots iniquity on his bed.<br>He sets himself in a way that is not good.<br>He doesn’t abhor evil.

<sup>5</sup> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.<br>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.<br>Your judgments are like a great deep.<br>Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.<br>
<sup>7</sup> How precious is your loving kindness, God!<br>The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.<br>You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For with you is the spring of life.<br>In your light we will see light.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,<br>your righteousness to the upright in heart.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.<br>Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.<br>
<sup>12</sup> There the workers of iniquity are fallen.<br>They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
## Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> Don’t fret because of evildoers,<br>neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,<br>and wither like the green herb.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Trust in Yahweh, and do good.<br>Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Also delight yourself in Yahweh,<br>and he will give you the desires of your heart.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to Yahweh.<br>Trust also in him, and he will do this:<br>
<sup>6</sup> he will make your righteousness shine out like light,<br>and your justice as the noon day sun.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.<br>Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,<br>because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.<br>Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off,<br>but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.<br>Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.<br>
<sup>11</sup> But the humble shall inherit the land,<br>and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The wicked plots against the just,<br>and gnashes at him with his teeth.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him,<br>for he sees that his day is coming.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,<br>to cast down the poor and needy,<br>to kill those who are upright on the path.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart.<br>Their bows shall be broken.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous has,<br>than the abundance of many wicked.<br>
<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<br>but Yahweh upholds the righteous.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.<br>Their inheritance shall be forever.<br>
<sup>19</sup> They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.<br>In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish.<br>The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields.<br>They will vanish—<br>vanish like smoke.<br>
<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,<br>but the righteous give generously.<br>
<sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.<br>Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.<br>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s steps are established by Yahweh.<br>He delights in his way.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Though he stumble, he shall not fall,<br>for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.<br>
<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old,<br>yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,<br>nor his children begging for bread.<br>
<sup>26</sup> All day long he deals graciously, and lends.<br>His offspring is blessed.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good.<br>Live securely forever.<br>
<sup>28</sup> For Yahweh loves justice,<br>and doesn’t forsake his saints.<br>They are preserved forever,<br>but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land,<br>and live in it forever.

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.<br>His tongue speaks justice.<br>
<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart.<br>None of his steps shall slide.<br>
<sup>32</sup> The wicked watch the righteous,<br>and seek to kill him.<br>
<sup>33</sup> Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,<br>nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way,<br>and he will exalt you to inherit the land.<br>When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power,<br>spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.<br>
<sup>36</sup> But he passed away, and behold, he was not.<br>Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,<br>for there is a future for the man of peace.<br>
<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.<br>The future of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.<br>He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.<br>
<sup>40</sup> Yahweh helps them and rescues them.<br>He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,<br>because they have taken refuge in him.
## Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,<br>neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For your arrows have pierced me,<br>your hand presses hard on me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,<br>neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have gone over my head.<br>As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.<br>
<sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt<br>because of my foolishness.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I am in pain and bowed down greatly.<br>I go mourning all day long.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For my waist is filled with burning.<br>There is no soundness in my flesh.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I am faint and severely bruised.<br>I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you.<br>My groaning is not hidden from you.<br>
<sup>10</sup> My heart throbs.<br>My strength fails me.<br>As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.<br>
<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.<br>My kinsmen stand far away.<br>
<sup>12</sup> They also who seek after my life lay snares.<br>Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,<br>and meditate deceits all day long.<br>
<sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.<br>I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,<br>in whose mouth are no reproofs.<br>
<sup>15</sup> For I hope in you, Yahweh.<br>You will answer, Lord my God.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,<br>or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”<br>
<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall.<br>My pain is continually before me.<br>
<sup>18</sup> For I will declare my iniquity.<br>I will be sorry for my sin.<br>
<sup>19</sup> But my enemies are vigorous and many.<br>Those who hate me without reason are numerous.<br>
<sup>20</sup> They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,<br>because I follow what is good.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t forsake me, Yahweh.<br>My God, don’t be far from me.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Hurry to help me,<br>Lord, my salvation.
## Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.<br>I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”<br>
<sup>2</sup> I was mute with silence.<br>I held my peace, even from good.<br>My sorrow was stirred.<br>
<sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me.<br>While I meditated, the fire burned.<br>I spoke with my tongue:<br>
<sup>4</sup> “Yahweh, show me my end,<br>what is the measure of my days.<br>Let me know how frail I am.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, you have made my days hand widths.<br>My lifetime is as nothing before you.<br>Surely every man stands as a breath.”<br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> “Surely every man walks like a shadow.<br>Surely they busy themselves in vain.<br>He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Now, Lord, what do I wait for?<br>My hope is in you.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions.<br>Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I was mute.<br>I didn’t open my mouth,<br>because you did it.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Remove your scourge away from me.<br>I am overcome by the blow of your hand.<br>
<sup>11</sup> When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,<br>you consume his wealth like a moth.<br>Surely every man is but a breath.”<br>Selah.

<sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.<br>Don’t be silent at my tears.<br>For I am a stranger with you,<br>a foreigner, as all my fathers were.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,<br>before I go away and exist no more.”
## Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for Yahweh.<br>He turned to me, and heard my cry.<br>
<sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,<br>out of the miry clay.<br>He set my feet on a rock,<br>and gave me a firm place to stand.<br>
<sup>3</sup> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.<br>Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,<br>and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,<br>and your thoughts which are toward us.<br>They can’t be declared back to you.<br>If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.<br>You have opened my ears.<br>You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Then I said, “Behold, I have come.<br>It is written about me in the book in the scroll.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I delight to do your will, my God.<br>Yes, your law is within my heart.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.<br>Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.<br>
<sup>10</sup> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.<br>I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.<br>I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.<br>Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have surrounded me.<br>My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.<br>They are more than the hairs of my head.<br>My heart has failed me.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.<br>Hurry to help me, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.<br>Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”<br>
<sup>16</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br>Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let Yahweh be exalted!”<br>
<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy.<br>May the Lord think about me.<br>You are my help and my deliverer.<br>Don’t delay, my God.
## Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he who considers the poor.<br>Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive.<br>He shall be blessed on the earth,<br>and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed,<br>and restore him from his bed of illness.<br>
<sup>4</sup> I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me!<br>Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”<br>
<sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil against me:<br>“When will he die, and his name perish?”<br>
<sup>6</sup> If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.<br>His heart gathers iniquity to itself.<br>When he goes abroad, he tells it.<br>
<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me.<br>They imagine the worst for me.<br>
<sup>8</sup> “An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him.<br>Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,<br>who ate bread with me,<br>has lifted up his heel against me.

<sup>10</sup> But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up,<br>that I may repay them.<br>
<sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me,<br>because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.<br>
<sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,<br>and set me in your presence forever.

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,<br>from everlasting and to everlasting!<br>Amen and amen.
## Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for the water brooks,<br>so my soul pants after you, God.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.<br>When shall I come and appear before God?<br>
<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night,<br>while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”<br>
<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,<br>how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house,<br>with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br>Why are you disturbed within me?<br>Hope in God!<br>For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.<br>
<sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me.<br>Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan,<br>the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.<br>All your waves and your billows have swept over me.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh<sup>b</sup> will command his loving kindness in the daytime.<br>In the night his song shall be with me:<br>a prayer to the God of my life.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me?<br>Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”<br>
<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,<br>while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”<br>
<sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br>Why are you disturbed within me?<br>Hope in God! For I shall still praise him,<br>the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
> - <sup>b</sup> 8. “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.

## Chapter 43

<sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.<br>Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?<br>Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?<br>
<sup>3</sup> Oh, send out your light and your truth.<br>Let them lead me.<br>Let them bring me to your holy hill,<br>to your tents.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God,<br>to God, my exceeding joy.<br>I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br>Why are you disturbed within me?<br>Hope in God!<br>For I shall still praise him:<br>my Savior, my helper, and my God.
## Chapter 44

<sup>1</sup> We have heard with our ears, God;<br>our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,<br>in the days of old.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with your hand,<br>but you planted them.<br>You afflicted the peoples,<br>but you spread them abroad.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,<br>neither did their own arm save them;<br>but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,<br>because you were favorable to them.<br>
<sup>4</sup> God, you are my King.<br>Command victories for Jacob!<br>
<sup>5</sup> Through you, we will push down our adversaries.<br>Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow,<br>neither will my sword save me.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But you have saved us from our adversaries,<br>and have shamed those who hate us.<br>
<sup>8</sup> In God we have made our boast all day long.<br>We will give thanks to your name forever.<br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,<br>and don’t go out with our armies.<br>
<sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary.<br>Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.<br>
<sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep for food,<br>and have scattered us among the nations.<br>
<sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing,<br>and have gained nothing from their sale.<br>
<sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbors,<br>a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.<br>
<sup>14</sup> You make us a byword among the nations,<br>a shaking of the head among the peoples.<br>
<sup>15</sup> All day long my dishonor is before me,<br>and shame covers my face,<br>
<sup>16</sup> at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,<br>because of the enemy and the avenger.<br>
<sup>17</sup> All this has come on us,<br>yet we haven’t forgotten you.<br>We haven’t been false to your covenant.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back,<br>neither have our steps strayed from your path,<br>
<sup>19</sup> though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,<br>and covered us with the shadow of death.<br>
<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God,<br>or spread out our hands to a strange god,<br>
<sup>21</sup> won’t God search this out?<br>For he knows the secrets of the heart.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.<br>We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up!<br>Why do you sleep, Lord?<sup>a</sup><br>Arise!<br>Don’t reject us forever.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face,<br>and forget our affliction and our oppression?<br>
<sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.<br>Our body clings to the earth.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Rise up to help us.<br>Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.

## Chapter 45

<sup>1</sup> My heart overflows with a noble theme.<br>I recite my verses for the king.<br>My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of the sons of men.<br>Grace has anointed your lips,<br>therefore God has blessed you forever.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Strap your sword on your thigh, O mighty one,<br>in your splendor and your majesty.<br>
<sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness.<br>Let your right hand display awesome deeds.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp.<br>The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Your throne, God, is forever and ever.<br>A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.<br>Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.<br>
<sup>8</sup> All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.<br>Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women.<br>At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.<br>Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.<br>
<sup>11</sup> So the king will desire your beauty,<br>honor him, for he is your lord.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.<br>The rich among the people entreat your favor.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The princess inside is all glorious.<br>Her clothing is interwoven with gold.<br>
<sup>14</sup> She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.<br>The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.<br>
<sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.<br>They shall enter into the king’s palace.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers.<br>You shall make them princes in all the earth.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.<br>Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
## Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength,<br>a very present help in trouble.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,<br>though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;<br>
<sup>3</sup> though its waters roar and are troubled,<br>though the mountains tremble with their swelling.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,<br>the holy place of the tents of the Most High.<br>
<sup>5</sup> God is within her. She shall not be moved.<br>God will help her at dawn.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.<br>He lifted his voice and the earth melted.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us.<br>The God of Jacob is our refuge.<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Come, see Yahweh’s works,<br>what desolations he has made in the earth.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.<br>He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.<br>He burns the chariots in the fire.<br>
<sup>10</sup> “Be still, and know that I am God.<br>I will be exalted among the nations.<br>I will be exalted in the earth.”<br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us.<br>The God of Jacob is our refuge.<br>Selah.
## Chapter 47

<sup>1</sup> Oh clap your hands, all you nations.<br>Shout to God with the voice of triumph!<br>
<sup>2</sup> For Yahweh Most High is awesome.<br>He is a great King over all the earth.<br>
<sup>3</sup> He subdues nations under us,<br>and peoples under our feet.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us,<br>the glory of Jacob whom he loved.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> God has gone up with a shout,<br>Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God! Sing praises!<br>Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!<br>
<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth.<br>Sing praises with understanding.<br>
<sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations.<br>God sits on his holy throne.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The princes of the peoples are gathered together,<br>the people of the God of Abraham.<br>For the shields of the earth belong to God.<br>He is greatly exalted!
## Chapter 48

<sup>1</sup> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised,<br>in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,<br>is Mount Zion, on the north sides,<br>the city of the great King.<br>
<sup>3</sup> God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For, behold, the kings assembled themselves,<br>they passed by together.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They saw it, then they were amazed.<br>They were dismayed.<br>They hurried away.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there,<br>pain, as of a woman in travail.<br>
<sup>7</sup> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.<br>
<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen,<br>in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God.<br>God will establish it forever.<br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> We have thought about your loving kindness, God,<br>in the middle of your temple.<br>
<sup>10</sup> As is your name, God,<br>so is your praise to the ends of the earth.<br>Your right hand is full of righteousness.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Let Mount Zion be glad!<br>Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go around her.<br>Number its towers.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Notice her bulwarks.<br>Consider her palaces,<br>that you may tell it to the next generation.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever.<br>He will be our guide even to death.
## Chapter 49

<sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples.<br>Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,<br>
<sup>2</sup> both low and high,<br>rich and poor together.<br>
<sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom.<br>My heart will utter understanding.<br>
<sup>4</sup> I will incline my ear to a proverb.<br>I will solve my riddle on the harp.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil,<br>when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?<br>
<sup>6</sup> Those who trust in their wealth,<br>and boast in the multitude of their riches—<br>
<sup>7</sup> none of them can by any means redeem his brother,<br>nor give God a ransom for him.<br>
<sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their life is costly,<br>no payment is ever enough,<br>
<sup>9</sup> that he should live on forever,<br>that he should not see corruption.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men die;<br>likewise the fool and the senseless perish,<br>and leave their wealth to others.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,<br>and their dwelling places to all generations.<br>They name their lands after themselves.<br>
<sup>12</sup> But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.<br>He is like the animals that perish.

<sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of those who are foolish,<br>and of those who approve their sayings.<br>Selah.

<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>Death shall be their shepherd.<br>The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.<br>Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,<sup>b</sup><br>far from their mansion.<br>
<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,<sup>c</sup><br>for he will receive me.<br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,<br>when the glory of his house is increased;<br>
<sup>17</sup> for when he dies he will carry nothing away.<br>His glory won’t descend after him.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul—<br>and men praise you when you do well for yourself—<br>
<sup>19</sup> he shall go to the generation of his fathers.<br>They shall never see the light.<br>
<sup>20</sup> A man who has riches without understanding,<br>is like the animals that perish.

## Chapter 50

<sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks,<br>and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,<br>God shines out.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Our God comes, and does not keep silent.<br>A fire devours before him.<br>It is very stormy around him.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens above,<br>to the earth, that he may judge his people:<br>
<sup>5</sup> “Gather my saints together to me,<br>those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”<br>
<sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare his righteousness,<br>for God himself is judge.<br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will speak.<br>Israel, I will testify against you.<br>I am God, your God.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices.<br>Your burnt offerings are continually before me.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall,<br>nor male goats from your pens.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For every animal of the forest is mine,<br>and the livestock on a thousand hills.<br>
<sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains.<br>The wild animals of the field are mine.<br>
<sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you,<br>for the world is mine, and all that is in it.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Will I eat the meat of bulls,<br>or drink the blood of goats?<br>
<sup>14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.<br>Pay your vows to the Most High.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Call on me in the day of trouble.<br>I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”

<sup>16</sup> But to the wicked God says,<br>“What right do you have to declare my statutes,<br>that you have taken my covenant on your lips,<br>
<sup>17</sup> since you hate instruction,<br>and throw my words behind you?<br>
<sup>18</sup> When you saw a thief, you consented with him,<br>and have participated with adulterers.

<sup>19</sup> “You give your mouth to evil.<br>Your tongue frames deceit.<br>
<sup>20</sup> You sit and speak against your brother.<br>You slander your own mother’s son.<br>
<sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent.<br>You thought that I was just like you.<br>I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.

<sup>22</sup> “Now consider this, you who forget God,<br>lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,<br>and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”
## Chapter 51

<sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.<br>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.<br>Cleanse me from my sin.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions.<br>My sin is constantly before me.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Against you, and you only, I have sinned,<br>and done that which is evil in your sight,<br>so you may be proved right when you speak,<br>and justified when you judge.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, I was born in iniquity.<br>My mother conceived me in sin.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.<br>You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.<br>Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness,<br>that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Hide your face from my sins,<br>and blot out all of my iniquities.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God.<br>Renew a right spirit within me.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t throw me from your presence,<br>and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of your salvation.<br>Uphold me with a willing spirit.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Then I will teach transgressors your ways.<br>Sinners will be converted to you.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.<br>My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips.<br>My mouth will declare your praise.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.<br>You have no pleasure in burnt offering.<br>
<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.<br>O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.

<sup>18</sup> Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.<br>Build the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,<br>in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.<br>Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
## Chapter 52

<sup>1</sup> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?<br>God’s loving kindness endures continually.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Your tongue plots destruction,<br>like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.<br>
<sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good,<br>lying rather than speaking the truth.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You love all devouring words,<br>you deceitful tongue.<br>
<sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy you forever.<br>He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,<br>and root you out of the land of the living.<br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> The righteous also will see it, and fear,<br>and laugh at him, saying,<br>
<sup>7</sup> “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,<br>but trusted in the abundance of his riches,<br>and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”<br>
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.<br>I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.<br>I will hope in your name, for it is good,<br>in the presence of your saints.
## Chapter 53

<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.<br>There is no one who does good.<br>
<sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on the children of men,<br>to see if there are any who understood,<br>who seek after God.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Every one of them has gone back.<br>They have become filthy together.<br>There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br>who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br>and don’t call on God?<br>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear, where no fear was,<br>for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.<br>You have put them to shame,<br>because God has rejected them.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br>When God brings back his people from captivity,<br>then Jacob shall rejoice,<br>and Israel shall be glad.
## Chapter 54

<sup>1</sup> Save me, God, by your name.<br>Vindicate me in your might.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, God.<br>Listen to the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me.<br>Violent men have sought after my soul.<br>They haven’t set God before them.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper.<br>The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He will repay the evil to my enemies.<br>Destroy them in your truth.<br>
<sup>6</sup> With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.<br>I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For he has delivered me out of all trouble.<br>My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
## Chapter 55

<sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, God.<br>Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Attend to me, and answer me.<br>I am restless in my complaint,<br>and moan
<sup>3</sup> because of the voice of the enemy,<br>because of the oppression of the wicked.<br>For they bring suffering on me.<br>In anger they hold a grudge against me.<br>
<sup>4</sup> My heart is severely pained within me.<br>The terrors of death have fallen on me.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.<br>Horror has overwhelmed me.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!<br>Then I would fly away, and be at rest.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, then I would wander far off.<br>I would lodge in the wilderness.”<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,<br>for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Day and night they prowl around on its walls.<br>Malice and abuse are also within her.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Destructive forces are within her.<br>Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy who insulted me,<br>then I could have endured it.<br>Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,<br>then I would have hidden myself from him.<br>
<sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man like me,<br>my companion, and my familiar friend.<br>
<sup>14</sup> We took sweet fellowship together.<br>We walked in God’s house with company.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly on them.<br>Let them go down alive into Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.<br>
<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call on God.<br>Yahweh will save me.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.<br>He will hear my voice.<br>
<sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,<br>although there are many who oppose me.<br>
<sup>19</sup> God, who is enthroned forever,<br>will hear and answer them.<br>Selah. They never change<br>and don’t fear God.<br>

<sup>20</sup> He raises his hands against his friends.<br>He has violated his covenant.<br>
<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter,<br>but his heart was war.<br>His words were softer than oil,<br>yet they were drawn swords.

<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on Yahweh and he will sustain you.<br>He will never allow the righteous to be moved.<br>
<sup>23</sup> But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.<br>Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,<br>but I will trust in you.

> - <sup>a</sup> 15. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 56

<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.<br>All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,<br>for they are many who fight proudly against me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid,<br>I will put my trust in you.<br>
<sup>4</sup> In God, I praise his word.<br>In God, I put my trust.<br>I will not be afraid.<br>What can flesh do to me?<br>
<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words.<br>All their thoughts are against me for evil.<br>
<sup>6</sup> They conspire and lurk,<br>watching my steps.<br>They are eager to take my life.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity?<br>In anger cast down the peoples, God.<br>
<sup>8</sup> You count my wanderings.<br>You put my tears into your container.<br>Aren’t they in your book?<br>
<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.<br>I know this: that God is for me.<br>
<sup>10</sup> In God, I will praise his word.<br>In Yahweh, I will praise his word.<br>
<sup>11</sup> I have put my trust in God.<br>I will not be afraid.<br>What can man do to me?<br>
<sup>12</sup> Your vows are on me, God.<br>I will give thank offerings to you.<br>
<sup>13</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death,<br>and prevented my feet from falling,<br>that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
## Chapter 57

<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,<br>for my soul takes refuge in you.<br>Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,<br>until disaster has passed.<br>
<sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High,<br>to God who accomplishes my requests for me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> He will send from heaven, and save me,<br>he rebukes the one who is pursuing me.<br>Selah.<br>God will send out his loving kindness and his truth.<br>

<sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions.<br>I lie among those who are set on fire,<br>even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,<br>and their tongue a sharp sword.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens!<br>Let your glory be above all the earth!

<sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps.<br>My soul is bowed down.<br>They dig a pit before me.<br>They fall into the middle of it themselves.<br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, God.<br>My heart is steadfast.<br>I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp!<br>I will wake up the dawn.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples.<br>I will sing praises to you among the nations.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens,<br>and your truth to the skies.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens.<br>Let your glory be over all the earth.
## Chapter 58

<sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?<br>Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?<br>
<sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you plot injustice.<br>You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb.<br>They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake,<br>like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,<br>
<sup>5</sup> which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers,<br>no matter how skillful the charmer may be.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.<br>Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Let them vanish like water that flows away.<br>When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,<br>like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns,<br>he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.<br>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,<br>
<sup>11</sup> so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous.<br>Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”
## Chapter 59

<sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, my God.<br>Set me on high from those who rise up against me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.<br>Save me from the bloodthirsty men.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.<br>The mighty gather themselves together against me,<br>not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>4</sup> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.<br>Rise up, behold, and help me!<br>
<sup>5</sup> You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel,<br>rouse yourself to punish the nations.<br>Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.<br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> They return at evening, howling like dogs,<br>and prowl around the city.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, they spew with their mouth.<br>Swords are in their lips,<br>“For”, they say, “who hears us?”<br>
<sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.<br>You scoff at all the nations.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,<br>for God is my high tower.<br>
<sup>10</sup> My God will go before me with his loving kindness.<br>God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.<br>Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,<br>let them be caught in their pride,<br>for the curses and lies which they utter.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath.<br>Consume them, and they will be no more.<br>Let them know that God rules in Jacob,<br>to the ends of the earth.<br>Selah.

<sup>14</sup> At evening let them return.<br>Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.<br>
<sup>15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food,<br>and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.

<sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength.<br>Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning.<br>For you have been my high tower,<br>a refuge in the day of my distress.<br>
<sup>17</sup> To you, my strength, I will sing praises.<br>For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
## Chapter 60

<sup>1</sup> God, you have rejected us.<br>You have broken us down.<br>You have been angry.<br>Restore us, again.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You have made the land tremble.<br>You have torn it.<br>Mend its fractures,<br>for it quakes.<br>
<sup>3</sup> You have shown your people hard things.<br>You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.<br>
<sup>4</sup> You have given a banner to those who fear you,<br>that it may be displayed because of the truth.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> So that your beloved may be delivered,<br>save with your right hand, and answer us.<br>
<sup>6</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary:<br>“I will triumph.<br>I will divide Shechem,<br>and measure out the valley of Succoth.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.<br>Ephraim also is the defense of my head.<br>Judah is my scepter.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Moab is my wash basin.<br>I will throw my sandal on Edom.<br>I shout in triumph over Philistia.”

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city?<br>Who has led me to Edom?<br>
<sup>10</sup> Haven’t you, God, rejected us?<br>You don’t go out with our armies, God.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary,<br>for the help of man is vain.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Through God we will do valiantly,<br>for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
## Chapter 61

<sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, God.<br>Listen to my prayer.<br>
<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.<br>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For you have been a refuge for me,<br>a strong tower from the enemy.<br>
<sup>4</sup> I will dwell in your tent forever.<br>I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> For you, God, have heard my vows.<br>You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You will prolong the king’s life.<br>His years will be for generations.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.<br>Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.<br>
<sup>8</sup> So I will sing praise to your name forever,<br>that I may fulfill my vows daily.
## Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> My soul rests in God alone.<br>My salvation is from him.<br>
<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress.<br>I will never be greatly shaken.<br>
<sup>3</sup> How long will you assault a man?<br>Would all of you throw him down,<br>like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?<br>
<sup>4</sup> They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.<br>They delight in lies.<br>They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God alone,<br>for my expectation is from him.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.<br>I will not be shaken.<br>
<sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor is with God.<br>The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people.<br>Pour out your heart before him.<br>God is a refuge for us.<br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are just a breath,<br>and men of high degree are a lie.<br>In the balances they will go up.<br>They are together lighter than a breath.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t trust in oppression.<br>Don’t become vain in robbery.<br>If riches increase,<br>don’t set your heart on them.<br>
<sup>11</sup> God has spoken once;<br>twice I have heard this,<br>that power belongs to God.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,<br>for you reward every man according to his work.
## Chapter 63

<sup>1</sup> God, you are my God.<br>I will earnestly seek you.<br>My soul thirsts for you.<br>My flesh longs for you,<br>in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.<br>
<sup>2</sup> So I have seen you in the sanctuary,<br>watching your power and your glory.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Because your loving kindness is better than life,<br>my lips shall praise you.<br>
<sup>4</sup> So I will bless you while I live.<br>I will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
<sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.<br>My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,<br>
<sup>6</sup> when I remember you on my bed,<br>and think about you in the night watches.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For you have been my help.<br>I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.<br>
<sup>8</sup> My soul stays close to you.<br>Your right hand holds me up.<br>
<sup>9</sup> But those who seek my soul to destroy it<br>shall go into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
<sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword.<br>They shall be jackal food.<br>
<sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God.<br>Everyone who swears by him will praise him,<br>for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
## Chapter 64

<sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.<br>Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,<br>from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;<br>
<sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongue like a sword,<br>and aim their arrows, deadly words,<br>
<sup>4</sup> to shoot innocent men from ambushes.<br>They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in evil plans.<br>They talk about laying snares secretly.<br>They say, “Who will see them?”<br>
<sup>6</sup> They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!”<br>Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them.<br>They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Their own tongues shall ruin them.<br>All who see them will shake their heads.<br>
<sup>9</sup> All mankind shall be afraid.<br>They shall declare the work of God,<br>and shall wisely ponder what he has done.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh,<br>and shall take refuge in him.<br>All the upright in heart shall praise him!
## Chapter 65

<sup>1</sup> Praise waits for you, God, in Zion.<br>Vows shall be performed to you.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You who hear prayer,<br>all men will come to you.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Sins overwhelmed me,<br>but you atoned for our transgressions.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the one whom you choose and cause to come near,<br>that he may live in your courts.<br>We will be filled with the goodness of your house,<br>your holy temple.<br>
<sup>5</sup> By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us,<br>God of our salvation.<br>You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,<br>of those who are far away on the sea.<br>
<sup>6</sup> By your power, you form the mountains,<br>having armed yourself with strength.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You still the roaring of the seas,<br>the roaring of their waves,<br>and the turmoil of the nations.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders.<br>You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You visit the earth, and water it.<br>You greatly enrich it.<br>The river of God is full of water.<br>You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.<br>
<sup>10</sup> You drench its furrows.<br>You level its ridges.<br>You soften it with showers.<br>You bless it with a crop.<br>
<sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your bounty.<br>Your carts overflow with abundance.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The wilderness grasslands overflow.<br>The hills are clothed with gladness.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The pastures are covered with flocks.<br>The valleys also are clothed with grain.<br>They shout for joy!<br>They also sing.
## Chapter 66

<sup>1</sup> Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!<br>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to the glory of his name!<br>Offer glory and praise!<br>
<sup>3</sup> Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds!<br>Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.<br>
<sup>4</sup> All the earth will worship you,<br>and will sing to you;<br>they will sing to your name.”<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Come, and see God’s deeds—<br>awesome work on behalf of the children of men.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land.<br>They went through the river on foot.<br>There, we rejoiced in him.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He rules by his might forever.<br>His eyes watch the nations.<br>Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him.<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Praise our God, you peoples!<br>Make the sound of his praise heard,<br>
<sup>9</sup> who preserves our life among the living,<br>and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For you, God, have tested us.<br>You have refined us, as silver is refined.<br>
<sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison.<br>You laid a burden on our backs.<br>
<sup>12</sup> You allowed men to ride over our heads.<br>We went through fire and through water,<br>but you brought us to the place of abundance.<br>
<sup>13</sup> I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.<br>I will pay my vows to you,
<sup>14</sup> which my lips promised,<br>and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.<br>
<sup>15</sup> I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,<br>with the offering of rams,<br>I will offer bulls with goats.<br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God.<br>I will declare what he has done for my soul.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth.<br>He was extolled with my tongue.<br>
<sup>18</sup> If I cherished sin in my heart,<br>the Lord wouldn’t have listened.<br>
<sup>19</sup> But most certainly, God has listened.<br>He has heard the voice of my prayer.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,<br>nor his loving kindness from me.
## Chapter 67

<sup>1</sup> May God be merciful to us, bless us,<br>and cause his face to shine on us.<br>Selah.

<sup>2</sup> That your way may be known on earth,<br>and your salvation among all nations,<br>
<sup>3</sup> let the peoples praise you, God.<br>Let all the peoples praise you.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy,<br>for you will judge the peoples with equity,<br>and govern the nations on earth.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Let the peoples praise you, God.<br>Let all the peoples praise you.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The earth has yielded its increase.<br>God, even our own God, will bless us.<br>
<sup>7</sup> God will bless us.<br>All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
## Chapter 68

<sup>1</sup> Let God arise!<br>Let his enemies be scattered!<br>Let them who hate him also flee before him.<br>
<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away,<br>so drive them away.<br>As wax melts before the fire,<br>so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br>
<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad.<br>Let them rejoice before God.<br>Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!<br>Extol him who rides on the clouds:<br>to Yah, his name!<br>Rejoice before him!<br>
<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,<br>is God in his holy habitation.<br>
<sup>6</sup> God sets the lonely in families.<br>He brings out the prisoners with singing,<br>but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.

<sup>7</sup> God, when you went out before your people,<br>when you marched through the wilderness...<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> The earth trembled.<br>The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai—<br>at the presence of God, the God of Israel.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You, God, sent a plentiful rain.<br>You confirmed your inheritance when it was weary.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Your congregation lived therein.<br>You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord announced the word.<br>The ones who proclaim it are a great company.<br>
<sup>12</sup> “Kings of armies flee! They flee!”<br>She who waits at home divides the plunder,<br>
<sup>13</sup> while you sleep among the camp fires,<br>the wings of a dove sheathed with silver,<br>her feathers with shining gold.<br>
<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in her,<br>it snowed on Zalmon.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.<br>The mountains of Bashan are rugged.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,<br>at the mountain where God chooses to reign?<br>Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.<br>
<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.<br>The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.<br>
<sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high.<br>You have led away captives.<br>You have received gifts among people,<br>yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,<br>even the God who is our salvation.<br>Selah.

<sup>20</sup> God is to us a God of deliverance.<br>To Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death.<br>
<sup>21</sup> But God will strike through the head of his enemies,<br>the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan,<br>I will bring you again from the depths of the sea,<br>
<sup>23</sup> that you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,<br>that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”<br>
<sup>24</sup> They have seen your processions, God,<br>even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.<br>
<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,<br>among the ladies playing with tambourines,<br>
<sup>26</sup> “Bless God in the congregations,<br>even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!”<br>
<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin, their ruler,<br>the princes of Judah, their council,<br>the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.

<sup>28</sup> Your God has commanded your strength.<br>Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,<br>kings shall bring presents to you.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,<br>the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the peoples.<br>Trample under foot the bars of silver.<br>Scatter the nations who delight in war.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt.<br>Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.<br>
<sup>32</sup> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!<br>Sing praises to the Lord—<br>Selah—

<sup>33</sup> to him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;<br>behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Ascribe strength to God!<br>His excellency is over Israel,<br>his strength is in the skies.<br>
<sup>35</sup> You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.<br>The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.<br>Praise be to God!
## Chapter 69

<sup>1</sup> Save me, God,<br>for the waters have come up to my neck!<br>
<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.<br>I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying.<br>My throat is dry.<br>My eyes fail looking for my God.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.<br>Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.<br>I have to restore what I didn’t take away.<br>
<sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness.<br>My sins aren’t hidden from you.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies.<br>Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.<br>Shame has covered my face.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br>an alien to my mother’s children.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of your house consumes me.<br>The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.<br>
<sup>10</sup> When I wept and I fasted,<br>that was to my reproach.<br>
<sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing,<br>I became a byword to them.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me.<br>I am the song of the drunkards.<br>
<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time.<br>God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.<br>Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,<br>neither let the deep swallow me up.<br>Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.<br>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t hide your face from your servant,<br>for I am in distress.<br>Answer me speedily!<br>
<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul and redeem it.<br>Ransom me because of my enemies.<br>
<sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.<br>My adversaries are all before you.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.<br>I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;<br>for comforters, but I found none.<br>
<sup>21</sup> They also gave me poison for my food.<br>In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare.<br>May it become a retribution and a trap.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.<br>Let their backs be continually bent.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Pour out your indignation on them.<br>Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate.<br>Let no one dwell in their tents.<br>
<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom you have wounded.<br>They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime.<br>Don’t let them come into your righteousness.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life,<br>and not be written with the righteous.<br>
<sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress.<br>Let your salvation, God, protect me.<br>
<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song,<br>and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br>
<sup>31</sup> It will please Yahweh better than an ox,<br>or a bull that has horns and hoofs.<br>
<sup>32</sup> The humble have seen it, and are glad.<br>You who seek after God, let your heart live.<br>
<sup>33</sup> For Yahweh hears the needy,<br>and doesn’t despise his captive people.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him;<br>the seas, and everything that moves therein!<br>
<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.<br>They shall settle there, and own it.<br>
<sup>36</sup> The children also of his servants shall inherit it.<br>Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
## Chapter 70

<sup>1</sup> Hurry, God, to deliver me.<br>Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.<br>Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned because of their shame<br>who say, “Aha! Aha!”<br>
<sup>4</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br>Let those who love your salvation continually say,<br>“Let God be exalted!”<br>
<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy.<br>Come to me quickly, God.<br>You are my help and my deliverer.<br>Yahweh, don’t delay.
## Chapter 71

<sup>1</sup> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.<br>Never let me be disappointed.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.<br>Turn your ear to me, and save me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.<br>Give the command to save me,<br>for you are my rock and my fortress.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,<br>from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh,<br>my confidence from my youth.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I have relied on you from the womb.<br>You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.<br>I will always praise you.<br>
<sup>7</sup> I am a marvel to many,<br>but you are my strong refuge.<br>
<sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with your praise,<br>with your honor all day long.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t reject me in my old age.<br>Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me.<br>Those who watch for my soul conspire together,<br>
<sup>11</sup> saying, “God has forsaken him.<br>Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”<br>
<sup>12</sup> God, don’t be far from me.<br>My God, hurry to help me.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.<br>Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.<br>
<sup>14</sup> But I will always hope,<br>and will add to all of your praise.<br>
<sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness,<br>and of your salvation all day,<br>though I don’t know its full measure.<br>
<sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.<br>I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.<br>
<sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth.<br>Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me,<br>until I have declared your strength to the next generation,<br>your might to everyone who is to come.<br>
<sup>19</sup> God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens.<br>You have done great things.<br>God, who is like you?<br>
<sup>20</sup> You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,<br>you will let me live.<br>You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Increase my honor<br>and comfort me again.<br>
<sup>22</sup> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.<br>I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.<br>
<sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy!<br>My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!<br>
<sup>24</sup> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,<br>for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,<br>who want to harm me.
## Chapter 72

<sup>1</sup> God, give the king your justice;<br>your righteousness to the royal son.<br>
<sup>2</sup> He will judge your people with righteousness,<br>and your poor with justice.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.<br>The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He will judge the poor of the people.<br>He will save the children of the needy,<br>and will break the oppressor in pieces.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They shall fear you while the sun endures;<br>and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He will come down like rain on the mown grass,<br>as showers that water the earth.<br>
<sup>7</sup> In his days, the righteous shall flourish,<br>and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,<br>from the River to the ends of the earth.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.<br>His enemies shall lick the dust.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.<br>The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.<br>All nations shall serve him.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy when he cries;<br>the poor, who has no helper.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and needy.<br>He will save the souls of the needy.<br>
<sup>14</sup> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.<br>Their blood will be precious in his sight.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He will live; and Sheba’s gold will be given to him.<br>Men will pray for him continually.<br>They will bless him all day long.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.<br>Its fruit sways like Lebanon.<br>Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.<br>
<sup>17</sup> His name endures forever.<br>His name continues as long as the sun.<br>Men shall be blessed by him.<br>All nations will call him blessed.

<sup>18</sup> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel,<br>who alone does marvelous deeds.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Blessed be his glorious name forever!<br>Let the whole earth be filled with his glory!<br>Amen and amen.

<sup>20</sup> This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
## Chapter 73

<sup>1</sup> Surely God<sup>a</sup> is good to Israel,<br>to those who are pure in heart.<br>
<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone.<br>My steps had nearly slipped.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the arrogant,<br>when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For there are no struggles in their death,<br>but their strength is firm.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They are free from burdens of men,<br>neither are they plagued like other men.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.<br>Violence covers them like a garment.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with fat.<br>Their minds pass the limits of conceit.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak with malice.<br>In arrogance, they threaten oppression.<br>
<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens.<br>Their tongue walks through the earth.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Therefore their people return to them,<br>and they drink up waters of abundance.<br>
<sup>11</sup> They say, “How does God know?<br>Is there knowledge in the Most High?”<br>
<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked.<br>Being always at ease, they increase in riches.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,<br>and washed my hands in innocence,<br>
<sup>14</sup> For all day long I have been plagued,<br>and punished every morning.<br>
<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak thus”,<br>behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.<br>
<sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand this,<br>it was too painful for me—<br>
<sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary,<br>and considered their latter end.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Surely you set them in slippery places.<br>You throw them down to destruction.<br>
<sup>19</sup> How they are suddenly destroyed!<br>They are completely swept away with terrors.<br>
<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one wakes up,<br>so, Lord,<sup>b</sup> when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.<br>
<sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved.<br>I was embittered in my heart.<br>
<sup>22</sup> I was so senseless and ignorant.<br>I was a brute beast before you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, I am continually with you.<br>You have held my right hand.<br>
<sup>24</sup> You will guide me with your counsel,<br>and afterward receive me to glory.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in heaven?<br>There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.<br>
<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fails,<br>but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.<br>
<sup>27</sup> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.<br>You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.<br>
<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come close to God.<br>I have made the Lord Yahweh<sup>c</sup> my refuge,<br>that I may tell of all your works.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).

## Chapter 74

<sup>1</sup> God, why have you rejected us forever?<br>Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?<br>
<sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,<br>which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:<br>Mount Zion, in which you have lived.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,<br>all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.<br>They have set up their standards as signs.<br>
<sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes,<br>cutting through a thicket of trees.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.<br>
<sup>7</sup> They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.<br>They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”<br>They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.<br>
<sup>9</sup> We see no miraculous signs.<br>There is no longer any prophet,<br>neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.<br>
<sup>10</sup> How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?<br>Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?<br>
<sup>11</sup> Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?<br>Take it from your chest and consume them!

<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old,<br>working salvation throughout the earth.<br>
<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by your strength.<br>You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.<br>
<sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.<br>You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.<br>
<sup>15</sup> You opened up spring and stream.<br>You dried up mighty rivers.<br>
<sup>16</sup> The day is yours, the night is also yours.<br>You have prepared the light and the sun.<br>
<sup>17</sup> You have set all the boundaries of the earth.<br>You have made summer and winter.

<sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.<br>Foolish people have blasphemed your name.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.<br>Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Honor your covenant,<br>for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.<br>Let the poor and needy praise your name.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Arise, God! Plead your own cause.<br>Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.<br>The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
## Chapter 75

<sup>1</sup> We give thanks to you, God.<br>We give thanks, for your Name is near.<br>Men tell about your wondrous works.

<sup>2</sup> When I choose the appointed time,<br>I will judge blamelessly.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.<br>I firmly hold its pillars.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”<br>I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t lift up your horn on high.<br>Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”<br>
<sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west,<br>nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge.<br>He puts down one, and lifts up another.<br>
<sup>8</sup> For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup,<br>full of foaming wine mixed with spices.<br>He pours it out.<br>Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.

<sup>9</sup> But I will declare this forever:<br>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br>
<sup>10</sup> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,<br>but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
## Chapter 76

<sup>1</sup> In Judah, God is known.<br>His name is great in Israel.<br>
<sup>2</sup> His tabernacle is also in Salem.<br>His dwelling place in Zion.<br>
<sup>3</sup> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,<br>the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Glorious are you, and excellent,<br>more than mountains of game.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Valiant men lie plundered,<br>they have slept their last sleep.<br>None of the men of war can lift their hands.<br>
<sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob,<br>both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You, even you, are to be feared.<br>Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?<br>
<sup>8</sup> You pronounced judgment from heaven.<br>The earth feared, and was silent,<br>
<sup>9</sup> when God arose to judgment,<br>to save all the afflicted ones of the earth.<br>Selah.

<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man praises you.<br>The survivors of your wrath are restrained.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!<br>Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.<br>
<sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes.<br>He is feared by the kings of the earth.
## Chapter 77

<sup>1</sup> My cry goes to God!<br>Indeed, I cry to God for help,<br>and for him to listen to me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.<br>My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.<br>My soul refused to be comforted.<br>
<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and I groan.<br>I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You hold my eyelids open.<br>I am so troubled that I can’t speak.<br>
<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old,<br>the years of ancient times.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night.<br>I consider in my own heart;<br>my spirit diligently inquires:<br>
<sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject us forever?<br>Will he be favorable no more?<br>
<sup>8</sup> Has his loving kindness vanished forever?<br>Does his promise fail for generations?<br>
<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br>Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”<br>Selah.

<sup>10</sup> Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:<br>the years of the right hand of the Most High.”<br>
<sup>11</sup> I will remember Yah’s deeds;<br>for I will remember your wonders of old.<br>
<sup>12</sup> I will also meditate on all your work,<br>and consider your doings.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.<br>What god is great like God?<br>
<sup>14</sup> You are the God who does wonders.<br>You have made your strength known among the peoples.<br>
<sup>15</sup> You have redeemed your people with your arm,<br>the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God.<br>The waters saw you, and they writhed.<br>The depths also convulsed.<br>
<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water.<br>The skies resounded with thunder.<br>Your arrows also flashed around.<br>
<sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.<br>The lightnings lit up the world.<br>The earth trembled and shook.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Your way was through the sea,<br>your paths through the great waters.<br>Your footsteps were not known.<br>
<sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock,<br>by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
## Chapter 78

<sup>1</sup> Hear my teaching, my people.<br>Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable.<br>I will utter dark sayings of old,<br>
<sup>3</sup> which we have heard and known,<br>and our fathers have told us.<br>
<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children,<br>telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,<br>his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For he established a covenant in Jacob,<br>and appointed a teaching in Israel,<br>which he commanded our fathers,<br>that they should make them known to their children;<br>
<sup>6</sup> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;<br>who should arise and tell their children,<br>
<sup>7</sup> that they might set their hope in God,<br>and not forget God’s deeds,<br>but keep his commandments,<br>
<sup>8</sup> and might not be as their fathers—<br>a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br>a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,<br>whose spirit was not steadfast with God.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<br>turned back in the day of battle.<br>
<sup>10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant,<br>and refused to walk in his law.<br>
<sup>11</sup> They forgot his doings,<br>his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.<br>
<sup>12</sup> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.<br>He made the waters stand as a heap.<br>
<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<br>and all night with a light of fire.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness,<br>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<br>
<sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock,<br>and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Yet they still went on to sin against him,<br>to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br>
<sup>18</sup> They tempted God in their heart<br>by asking food according to their desire.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Yes, they spoke against God.<br>They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br>
<sup>20</sup> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<br>and streams overflowed.<br>Can he give bread also?<br>Will he provide meat for his people?”<br>
<sup>21</sup> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.<br>A fire was kindled against Jacob,<br>anger also went up against Israel,<br>
<sup>22</sup> because they didn’t believe in God,<br>and didn’t trust in his salvation.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above,<br>and opened the doors of heaven.<br>
<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna on them to eat,<br>and gave them food from the sky.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels.<br>He sent them food to the full.<br>
<sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<br>By his power he guided the south wind.<br>
<sup>27</sup> He also rained meat on them as the dust,<br>winged birds as the sand of the seas.<br>
<sup>28</sup> He let them fall in the middle of their camp,<br>around their habitations.<br>
<sup>29</sup> So they ate, and were well filled.<br>He gave them their own desire.<br>
<sup>30</sup> They didn’t turn from their cravings.<br>Their food was yet in their mouths,<br>
<sup>31</sup> when the anger of God went up against them,<br>killed some of their strongest,<br>and struck down the young men of Israel.<br>
<sup>32</sup> For all this they still sinned,<br>and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.<br>
<sup>33</sup> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<br>and their years in terror.<br>
<sup>34</sup> When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<br>They returned and sought God earnestly.<br>
<sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock,<br>the Most High God, their redeemer.<br>
<sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth,<br>and lied to him with their tongue.<br>
<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him,<br>neither were they faithful in his covenant.<br>
<sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.<br>Yes, many times he turned his anger away,<br>and didn’t stir up all his wrath.<br>
<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh,<br>a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.<br>
<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br>and grieved him in the desert!<br>
<sup>41</sup> They turned again and tempted God,<br>and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<sup>42</sup> They didn’t remember his hand,<br>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<br>
<sup>43</sup> how he set his signs in Egypt,<br>his wonders in the field of Zoan,<br>
<sup>44</sup> he turned their rivers into blood,<br>and their streams, so that they could not drink.<br>
<sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<br>and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>
<sup>46</sup> He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,<br>and their labor to the locust.<br>
<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail,<br>their sycamore fig trees with frost.<br>
<sup>48</sup> He also gave over their livestock to the hail,<br>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br>
<sup>49</sup> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<br>wrath, indignation, and trouble,<br>and a band of angels of evil.<br>
<sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger.<br>He didn’t spare their soul from death,<br>but gave their life over to the pestilence,<br>
<sup>51</sup> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br>
<sup>52</sup> But he led out his own people like sheep,<br>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>
<sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,<br>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>
<sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<br>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.<br>
<sup>55</sup> He also drove out the nations before them,<br>allotted them for an inheritance by line,<br>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br>
<sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<br>and didn’t keep his testimonies,<br>
<sup>57</sup> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<br>They were twisted like a deceitful bow.<br>
<sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<br>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.<br>
<sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was angry,<br>and greatly abhorred Israel,<br>
<sup>60</sup> so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,<br>the tent which he placed among men,<br>
<sup>61</sup> and delivered his strength into captivity,<br>his glory into the adversary’s hand.<br>
<sup>62</sup> He also gave his people over to the sword,<br>and was angry with his inheritance.<br>
<sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men.<br>Their virgins had no wedding song.<br>
<sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword,<br>and their widows couldn’t weep.<br>
<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<br>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.<br>
<sup>66</sup> He struck his adversaries backward.<br>He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br>
<sup>67</sup> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<br>and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br>
<sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah,<br>Mount Zion which he loved.<br>
<sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br>like the earth which he has established forever.<br>
<sup>70</sup> He also chose David his servant,<br>and took him from the sheepfolds;<br>
<sup>71</sup> from following the ewes that have their young,<br>he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,<br>and Israel, his inheritance.<br>
<sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,<br>and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
## Chapter 79

<sup>1</sup> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.<br>They have defiled your holy temple.<br>They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.<br>
<sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,<br>the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.<br>
<sup>3</sup> They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.<br>There was no one to bury them.<br>
<sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbors,<br>a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.<br>
<sup>5</sup> How long, Yahweh?<br>Will you be angry forever?<br>Will your jealousy burn like fire?<br>
<sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<br>on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,<br>
<sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob,<br>and destroyed his homeland.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.<br>Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,<br>for we are in desperate need.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.<br>Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<br>Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes,<br>that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.<br>According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom<br>their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.<br>
<sup>13</sup> So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,<br>will give you thanks forever.<br>We will praise you forever, to all generations.
## Chapter 80

<sup>1</sup> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,<br>you who lead Joseph like a flock,<br>you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your might!<br>Come to save us!<br>
<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, God.<br>Cause your face to shine,<br>and we will be saved.

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh God of Armies,<br>how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?<br>
<sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears,<br>and given them tears to drink in large measure.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.<br>Our enemies laugh among themselves.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, God of Armies.<br>Cause your face to shine,<br>and we will be saved.

<sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Egypt.<br>You drove out the nations, and planted it.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it.<br>It took deep root, and filled the land.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shadow.<br>Its boughs were like God’s cedars.<br>
<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the sea,<br>its shoots to the River.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls,<br>so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?<br>
<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood ravages it.<br>The wild animals of the field feed on it.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.<br>Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,<br>
<sup>15</sup> the stock which your right hand planted,<br>the branch that you made strong for yourself.<br>
<sup>16</sup> It’s burned with fire.<br>It’s cut down.<br>They perish at your rebuke.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,<br>on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.<br>
<sup>18</sup> So we will not turn away from you.<br>Revive us, and we will call on your name.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.<br>Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
## Chapter 81

<sup>1</sup> Sing aloud to God, our strength!<br>Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!<br>
<sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,<br>the pleasant lyre with the harp.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,<br>at the full moon, on our feast day.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel,<br>an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant,<br>when he went out over the land of Egypt,<br>I heard a language that I didn’t know.<br>
<sup>6</sup> “I removed his shoulder from the burden.<br>His hands were freed from the basket.<br>
<sup>7</sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you.<br>I answered you in the secret place of thunder.<br>I tested you at the waters of Meribah.”<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you,<br>Israel, if you would listen to me!<br>
<sup>9</sup> There shall be no strange god in you,<br>neither shall you worship any foreign god.<br>
<sup>10</sup> I am Yahweh, your God,<br>who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.<br>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br>
<sup>11</sup> But my people didn’t listen to my voice.<br>Israel desired none of me.<br>
<sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,<br>that they might walk in their own counsels.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would listen to me,<br>that Israel would walk in my ways!<br>
<sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies,<br>and turn my hand against their adversaries.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him,<br>and their punishment would last forever.<br>
<sup>16</sup> But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.<br>I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
## Chapter 82

<sup>1</sup> God presides in the great assembly.<br>He judges among the gods.<br>
<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly,<br>and show partiality to the wicked?”<br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.<br>Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy.<br>Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”<br>
<sup>5</sup> They don’t know, neither do they understand.<br>They walk back and forth in darkness.<br>All the foundations of the earth are shaken.<br>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “You are gods,<br>all of you are sons of the Most High.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless you shall die like men,<br>and fall like one of the rulers.”<br>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, God, judge the earth,<br>for you inherit all of the nations.
## Chapter 83

<sup>1</sup> God, don’t keep silent.<br>Don’t keep silent,<br>and don’t be still, God.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.<br>Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.<br>
<sup>3</sup> They conspire with cunning against your people.<br>They plot against your cherished ones.<br>
<sup>4</sup> “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation,<br>that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”<br>
<sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one mind.<br>They form an alliance against you.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;<br>Moab, and the Hagrites;<br>
<sup>7</sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;<br>Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;<br>
<sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them.<br>They have helped the children of Lot.<br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian,<br>as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;<br>
<sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor,<br>who became as dung for the earth.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,<br>yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,<br>
<sup>12</sup> who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.”<br>
<sup>13</sup> My God, make them like tumbleweed,<br>like chaff before the wind.<br>
<sup>14</sup> As the fire that burns the forest,<br>as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,<br>
<sup>15</sup> so pursue them with your tempest,<br>and terrify them with your storm.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion,<br>that they may seek your name, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.<br>Yes, let them be confounded and perish;<br>
<sup>18</sup> that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,<br>are the Most High over all the earth.
## Chapter 84

<sup>1</sup> How lovely are your dwellings,<br>Yahweh of Armies!<br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.<br>My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Yes, the sparrow has found a home,<br>and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young,<br>near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house.<br>They are always praising you.<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in you,<br>who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs.<br>Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.<br>
<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength.<br>Every one of them appears before God in Zion.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.<br>Listen, God of Jacob.<br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Behold, God our shield,<br>look at the face of your anointed.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.<br>I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,<br>than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.<br>Yahweh will give grace and glory.<br>He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Yahweh of Armies,<br>blessed is the man who trusts in you.
## Chapter 85

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land.<br>You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.<br>You have covered all their sin.<br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> You have taken away all your wrath.<br>You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Turn us, God of our salvation,<br>and cause your indignation toward us to cease.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever?<br>Will you draw out your anger to all generations?<br>
<sup>6</sup> Won’t you revive us again,<br>that your people may rejoice in you?<br>
<sup>7</sup> Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh.<br>Grant us your salvation.<br>
<sup>8</sup> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak,<br>for he will speak peace to his people, his saints;<br>but let them not turn again to folly.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,<br>that glory may dwell in our land.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Mercy and truth meet together.<br>Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Truth springs out of the earth.<br>Righteousness has looked down from heaven.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good.<br>Our land will yield its increase.<br>

<sup>3</sup> Be merciful to me, Lord,<br>for I call to you all day long.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Bring joy to the soul of your servant,<br>for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,<br>abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, Yahweh, my prayer.<br>Listen to the voice of my petitions.<br>
<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call on you,<br>for you will answer me.<br>
<sup>8</sup> There is no one like you among the gods, Lord,<br>nor any deeds like your deeds.<br>
<sup>9</sup> All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.<br>They shall glorify your name.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For you are great, and do wondrous things.<br>You are God alone.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh.<br>I will walk in your truth.<br>Make my heart undivided to fear your name.<br>
<sup>12</sup> I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.<br>I will glorify your name forever more.<br>
<sup>13</sup> For your loving kindness is great toward me.<br>You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>14</sup> God, the proud have risen up against me.<br>A company of violent men have sought after my soul,<br>and they don’t hold regard for you before them.<br>
<sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God,<br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me!<br>Give your strength to your servant.<br>Save the son of your servant.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Show me a sign of your goodness,<br>that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed,<br>because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.

<sup>1</sup> His foundation is in the holy mountains.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.<br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> I will record Rahab<sup>a</sup> and Babylon among those who acknowledge me.<br>Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:<br>“This one was born there.”<br>
<sup>5</sup> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;”<br>the Most High himself will establish her.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples,<br>“This one was born there.”<br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Those who sing as well as those who dance say,<br>“All my springs are in you.”

## Chapter 88

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, the God of my salvation,<br>I have cried day and night before you.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into your presence.<br>Turn your ear to my cry.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles.<br>My life draws near to Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down into the pit.<br>I am like a man who has no help,<br>
<sup>5</sup> set apart among the dead,<br>like the slain who lie in the grave,<br>whom you remember no more.<br>They are cut off from your hand.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest pit,<br>in the darkest depths.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me.<br>You have afflicted me with all your waves.<br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> You have taken my friends from me.<br>You have made me an abomination to them.<br>I am confined, and I can’t escape.<br>
<sup>9</sup> My eyes are dim from grief.<br>I have called on you daily, Yahweh.<br>I have spread out my hands to you.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Do you show wonders to the dead?<br>Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you?<br>Selah.

<sup>11</sup> Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?<br>Or your faithfulness in Destruction?<br>
<sup>12</sup> Are your wonders made known in the dark?<br>Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<br>
<sup>13</sup> But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.<br>In the morning, my prayer comes before you.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?<br>Why do you hide your face from me?<br>
<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.<br>While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me.<br>Your terrors have cut me off.<br>
<sup>17</sup> They came around me like water all day long.<br>They completely engulfed me.<br>
<sup>18</sup> You have put lover and friend far from me,<br>and my friends into darkness.

## Chapter 89

<sup>1</sup> I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever.<br>With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.<br>
<sup>2</sup> I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.<br>You established the heavens.<br>Your faithfulness is in them.”

<sup>3</sup> “I have made a covenant with my chosen one,<br>I have sworn to David, my servant,<br>
<sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your offspring forever,<br>and build up your throne to all generations.’ ”<br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh,<br>your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?<br>Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,<br>
<sup>7</sup> a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,<br>to be feared above all those who are around him?<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?<br>Yah, your faithfulness is around you.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You rule the pride of the sea.<br>When its waves rise up, you calm them.<br>
<sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.<br>You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours.<br>The earth also is yours,<br>the world and its fullness.<br>You have founded them.<br>
<sup>12</sup> You have created the north and the south.<br>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.<br>
<sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm.<br>Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br>Loving kindness and truth go before your face.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.<br>They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>16</sup> In your name they rejoice all day.<br>In your righteousness, they are exalted.<br>
<sup>17</sup> For you are the glory of their strength.<br>In your favor, our horn will be exalted.<br>
<sup>18</sup> For our shield belongs to Yahweh,<br>our king to the Holy One of Israel.

<sup>19</sup> Then you spoke in vision to your saints,<br>and said, “I have given strength to the warrior.<br>I have exalted a young man from the people.<br>
<sup>20</sup> I have found David, my servant.<br>I have anointed him with my holy oil,<br>
<sup>21</sup> with whom my hand shall be established.<br>My arm will also strengthen him.<br>
<sup>22</sup> No enemy will tax him.<br>No wicked man will oppress him.<br>
<sup>23</sup> I will beat down his adversaries before him,<br>and strike those who hate him.<br>
<sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.<br>In my name, his horn will be exalted.<br>
<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea,<br>and his right hand on the rivers.<br>
<sup>26</sup> He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,<br>my God, and the rock of my salvation!’<br>
<sup>27</sup> I will also appoint him my firstborn,<br>the highest of the kings of the earth.<br>
<sup>28</sup> I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.<br>My covenant will stand firm with him.<br>
<sup>29</sup> I will also make his offspring endure forever,<br>and his throne as the days of heaven.<br>
<sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law,<br>and don’t walk in my ordinances;<br>
<sup>31</sup> if they break my statutes,<br>and don’t keep my commandments;<br>
<sup>32</sup> then I will punish their sin with the rod,<br>and their iniquity with stripes.<br>
<sup>33</sup> But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,<br>nor allow my faithfulness to fail.<br>
<sup>34</sup> I will not break my covenant,<br>nor alter what my lips have uttered.<br>
<sup>35</sup> Once I have sworn by my holiness,<br>I will not lie to David.<br>
<sup>36</sup> His offspring will endure forever,<br>his throne like the sun before me.<br>
<sup>37</sup> It will be established forever like the moon,<br>the faithful witness in the sky.”<br>Selah.

<sup>38</sup> But you have rejected and spurned.<br>You have been angry with your anointed.<br>
<sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant of your servant.<br>You have defiled his crown in the dust.<br>
<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges.<br>You have brought his strongholds to ruin.<br>
<sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way rob him.<br>He has become a reproach to his neighbors.<br>
<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.<br>You have made all of his enemies rejoice.<br>
<sup>43</sup> Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,<br>and haven’t supported him in battle.<br>
<sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor,<br>and thrown his throne down to the ground.<br>
<sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth.<br>You have covered him with shame.<br>Selah.

<sup>46</sup> How long, Yahweh?<br>Will you hide yourself forever?<br>Will your wrath burn like fire?<br>
<sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is,<br>for what vanity you have created all the children of men!<br>
<sup>48</sup> What man is he who shall live and not see death,<br>who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?<sup>a</sup><br>Selah.

<sup>49</sup> Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,<br>which you swore to David in your faithfulness?<br>
<sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,<br>how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,<br>
<sup>51</sup> With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh,<br>with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be Yahweh forever more.<br>Amen, and Amen.

## Chapter 90

<sup>1</sup> Lord,<sup>a</sup> you have been our dwelling place for all generations.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born,<br>before you had formed the earth and the world,<br>even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.<br>
<sup>3</sup> You turn man to destruction, saying,<br>“Return, you children of men.”<br>
<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past,<br>like a watch in the night.<br>
<sup>5</sup> You sweep them away as they sleep.<br>In the morning they sprout like new grass.<br>
<sup>6</sup> In the morning it sprouts and springs up.<br>By evening, it is withered and dry.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in your anger.<br>We are troubled in your wrath.<br>
<sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you,<br>our secret sins in the light of your presence.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in your wrath.<br>We bring our years to an end as a sigh.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The days of our years are seventy,<br>or even by reason of strength eighty years;<br>yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,<br>for it passes quickly, and we fly away.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of your anger,<br>your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?<br>
<sup>12</sup> So teach us to count our days,<br>that we may gain a heart of wisdom.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Relent, Yahweh!<sup>b</sup><br>How long?<br>Have compassion on your servants!<br>
<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,<br>that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,<br>for as many years as we have seen evil.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Let your work appear to your servants,<br>your glory to their children.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us.<br>Establish the work of our hands for us.<br>Yes, establish the work of our hands.

## Chapter 91

<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br>will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
<sup>2</sup> I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br>my God, in whom I trust.”<br>
<sup>3</sup> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,<br>and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers.<br>Under his wings you will take refuge.<br>His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.<br>
<sup>5</sup> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br>nor of the arrow that flies by day,<br>
<sup>6</sup> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br>nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.<br>
<sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side,<br>and ten thousand at your right hand;<br>but it will not come near you.<br>
<sup>8</sup> You will only look with your eyes,<br>and see the recompense of the wicked.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Because you have made Yahweh your refuge,<br>and the Most High your dwelling place,<br>
<sup>10</sup> no evil shall happen to you,<br>neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For he will put his angels in charge of you,<br>to guard you in all your ways.<br>
<sup>12</sup> They will bear you up in their hands,<br>so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.<br>
<sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra.<br>You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.<br>
<sup>14</sup> “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.<br>I will set him on high, because he has known my name.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him.<br>I will be with him in trouble.<br>I will deliver him, and honor him.<br>
<sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life,<br>and show him my salvation.”

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah,<br>and teach out of your law,<br>
<sup>13</sup> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,<br>until the pit is dug for the wicked.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh won’t reject his people,<br>neither will he forsake his inheritance.<br>
<sup>15</sup> For judgment will return to righteousness.<br>All the upright in heart shall follow it.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked?<br>Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?<br>
<sup>17</sup> Unless Yahweh had been my help,<br>my soul would have soon lived in silence.<br>
<sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot is slipping!”<br>Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.<br>
<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me,<br>your comforts delight my soul.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,<br>which brings about mischief by statute?<br>
<sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,<br>and condemn the innocent blood.<br>
<sup>22</sup> But Yahweh has been my high tower,<br>my God, the rock of my refuge.<br>
<sup>23</sup> He has brought on them their own iniquity,<br>and will cut them off in their own wickedness.<br>Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.

<sup>13</sup> You will arise and have mercy on Zion,<br>for it is time to have pity on her.<br>Yes, the set time has come.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For your servants take pleasure in her stones,<br>and have pity on her dust.<br>

<sup>18</sup> This will be written for the generation to come.<br>A people which will be created will praise Yah,<br>

<sup>21</sup> that men may declare Yahweh’s name in Zion,<br>and his praise in Jerusalem,<br>
<sup>22</sup> when the peoples are gathered together,<br>the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is merciful and gracious,<br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse;<br>neither will he stay angry forever.<br>
<sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins,<br>nor repaid us for our iniquities.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.<br>
<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west,<br>so far has he removed our transgressions from us.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Like a father has compassion on his children,<br>so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For he knows how we are made.<br>He remembers that we are dust.<br>
<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass.<br>As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.<br>Its place remembers it no more.<br>

<sup>3</sup> He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters.<br>He makes the clouds his chariot.<br>He walks on the wings of the wind.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He makes his messengers<sup>a</sup> winds,<br>and his servants flames of fire.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He laid the foundations of the earth,<br>that it should not be moved forever.<br>
<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.<br>The waters stood above the mountains.<br>
<sup>7</sup> At your rebuke they fled.<br>At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.<br>
<sup>8</sup> The mountains rose,<br>the valleys sank down,<br>to the place which you had assigned to them.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,<br>that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.<br>

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every animal of the field.<br>The wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by them.<br>They sing among the branches.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his rooms.<br>The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.<br>
<sup>14</sup> He causes the grass to grow for the livestock,<br>and plants for man to cultivate,<br>that he may produce food out of the earth:<br>
<sup>15</sup> wine that makes the heart of man glad,<br>oil to make his face to shine,<br>and bread that strengthens man’s heart.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s trees are well watered,<br>the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,<br>
<sup>17</sup> where the birds make their nests.<br>The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.<br>
<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats.<br>The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.<br>
<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons.<br>The sun knows when to set.<br>
<sup>20</sup> You make darkness, and it is night,<br>in which all the animals of the forest prowl.<br>
<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey,<br>and seek their food from God.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away,<br>and lie down in their dens.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work,<br>to his labor until the evening.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Yahweh, how many are your works!<br>In wisdom, you have made them all.<br>The earth is full of your riches.<br>
<sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide,<br>in which are innumerable living things,<br>both small and large animals.<br>
<sup>26</sup> There the ships go,<br>and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.<br>
<sup>27</sup> These all wait for you,<br>that you may give them their food in due season.<br>
<sup>28</sup> You give to them; they gather.<br>You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.<br>
<sup>29</sup> You hide your face; they are troubled.<br>You take away their breath; they die and return to the dust.<br>
<sup>30</sup> You send out your Spirit and they are created.<br>You renew the face of the ground.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Let Yahweh’s glory endure forever.<br>Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.<br>
<sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles.<br>He touches the mountains, and they smoke.<br>
<sup>33</sup> I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.<br>I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet to him.<br>I will rejoice in Yahweh.<br>

## Chapter 106

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh!<br>Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,<br>or fully declare all his praise?<br>
<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who keep justice.<br>Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.<br>Visit me with your salvation,<br>
<sup>5</sup> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,<br>that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,<br>that I may glory with your inheritance.

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers.<br>We have committed iniquity.<br>We have done wickedly.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.<br>They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,<br>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,<br>that he might make his mighty power known.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;<br>so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.<br>
<sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br>and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries.<br>There was not one of them left.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Then they believed his words.<br>They sang his praise.

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works.<br>They didn’t wait for his counsel,<br>
<sup>14</sup> but gave in to craving in the desert,<br>and tested God in the wasteland.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He gave them their request,<br>but sent leanness into their soul.<br>
<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp,<br>and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.<br>
<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,<br>and covered the company of Abiram.<br>
<sup>18</sup> A fire was kindled in their company.<br>The flame burned up the wicked.<br>
<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb,<br>and worshiped a molten image.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory<br>for an image of a bull that eats grass.<br>
<sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their Savior,<br>who had done great things in Egypt,<br>
<sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham,<br>and awesome things by the Red Sea.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,<br>had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,<br>to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Yes, they despised the pleasant land.<br>They didn’t believe his word,<br>
<sup>25</sup> but murmured in their tents,<br>and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Therefore he swore to them<br>that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,<br>
<sup>27</sup> that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,<br>and scatter them in the lands.<br>
<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,<br>and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.<br>The plague broke in on them.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,<br>so the plague was stopped.<br>
<sup>31</sup> That was credited to him for righteousness,<br>for all generations to come.<br>
<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,<br>so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;<br>
<sup>33</sup> because they were rebellious against his spirit,<br>he spoke rashly with his lips.<br>
<sup>34</sup> They didn’t destroy the peoples,<br>as Yahweh commanded them,<br>
<sup>35</sup> but mixed themselves with the nations,<br>and learned their works.<br>
<sup>36</sup> They served their idols,<br>which became a snare to them.<br>
<sup>37</sup> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<br>
<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood,<br>even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,<br>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<br>The land was polluted with blood.<br>
<sup>39</sup> Thus they were defiled with their works,<br>and prostituted themselves in their deeds.<br>
<sup>40</sup> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.<br>He abhorred his inheritance.<br>
<sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hand of the nations.<br>Those who hated them ruled over them.<br>
<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them.<br>They were brought into subjection under their hand.<br>

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.<br>They found no city to live in.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,<br>their soul fainted in them.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,<br>and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way,<br>that they might go to a city to live in.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,<br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the longing soul.<br>He fills the hungry soul with good.

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br>being bound in affliction and iron,<br>
<sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against the words of God,<sup>b</sup><br>and condemned the counsel of the Most High.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.<br>They fell down, and there was no one to help.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,<br>and he saved them out of their distresses.<br>
<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,<br>and broke away their chains.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,<br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>16</sup> For he has broken the gates of bronze,<br>and cut through bars of iron.

<sup>17</sup> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,<br>and because of their iniquities.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhors all kinds of food.<br>They draw near to the gates of death.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,<br>and he saves them out of their distresses.<br>
<sup>20</sup> He sends his word, and heals them,<br>and delivers them from their graves.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,<br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>22</sup> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,<br>and declare his deeds with singing.

<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships,<br>who do business in great waters,<br>
<sup>24</sup> these see Yahweh’s deeds,<br>and his wonders in the deep.<br>
<sup>25</sup> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,<br>which lifts up its waves.<br>
<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.<br>Their soul melts away because of trouble.<br>
<sup>27</sup> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,<br>and are at their wits’ end.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,<br>and he brings them out of their distress.<br>
<sup>29</sup> He makes the storm a calm,<br>so that its waves are still.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Then they are glad because it is calm,<br>so he brings them to their desired haven.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,<br>for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,<br>and praise him in the seat of the elders.

<sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into a desert,<br>water springs into a thirsty ground,<br>
<sup>34</sup> and a fruitful land into a salt waste,<br>for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.<br>
<sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool of water,<br>and a dry land into water springs.<br>
<sup>36</sup> There he makes the hungry live,<br>that they may prepare a city to live in,<br>
<sup>37</sup> sow fields, plant vineyards,<br>and reap the fruits of increase.<br>
<sup>38</sup> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.<br>He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.<br>
<sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down<br>through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.<br>
<sup>40</sup> He pours contempt on princes,<br>and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.<br>
<sup>41</sup> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,<br>and increases their families like a flock.<br>
<sup>42</sup> The upright will see it, and be glad.<br>All the wicked will shut their mouths.<br>
<sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.<br>They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

<sup>13</sup> Through God, we will do valiantly,<br>for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
## Chapter 109

<sup>1</sup> God of my praise, don’t remain silent,<br>
<sup>2</sup> for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.<br>They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.<br>

<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off.<br>In the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.<br>Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be before Yahweh continually,<br>that he may cut off their memory from the earth;<br>
<sup>16</sup> because he didn’t remember to show kindness,<br>but persecuted the poor and needy man,<br>the broken in heart, to kill them.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.<br>He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.<br>
<sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.<br>It came into his inward parts like water,<br>like oil into his bones.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,<br>for the belt that is always around him.<br>
<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,<br>of those who speak evil against my soul.

<sup>21</sup> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,<sup>a</sup> for your name’s sake,<br>because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;<br>
<sup>22</sup> for I am poor and needy.<br>My heart is wounded within me.<br>
<sup>23</sup> I fade away like an evening shadow.<br>I am shaken off like a locust.<br>
<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting.<br>My body is thin and lacks fat.<br>
<sup>25</sup> I have also become a reproach to them.<br>When they see me, they shake their head.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Help me, Yahweh, my God.<br>Save me according to your loving kindness;<br>
<sup>27</sup> that they may know that this is your hand;<br>that you, Yahweh, have done it.<br>
<sup>28</sup> They may curse, but you bless.<br>When they arise, they will be shamed,<br>but your servant shall rejoice.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.<br>Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.<br>
<sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.<br>Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.<br>
<sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,<br>to save him from those who judge his soul.

<sup>59</sup> I considered my ways,<br>and turned my steps to your statutes.<br>
<sup>60</sup> I will hurry, and not delay,<br>to obey your commandments.<br>
<sup>61</sup> The ropes of the wicked bind me,<br>but I won’t forget your law.<br>
<sup>62</sup> At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you,<br>because of your righteous ordinances.<br>
<sup>63</sup> I am a friend of all those who fear you,<br>of those who observe your precepts.<br>
<sup>64</sup> The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.<br>Teach me your statutes.

<sup>65</sup> You have treated your servant well,<br>according to your word, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and knowledge,<br>for I believe in your commandments.<br>
<sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted, I went astray;<br>but now I observe your word.<br>
<sup>68</sup> You are good, and do good.<br>Teach me your statutes.<br>
<sup>69</sup> The proud have smeared a lie upon me.<br>With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts.<br>
<sup>70</sup> Their heart is as callous as the fat,<br>but I delight in your law.<br>
<sup>71</sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted,<br>that I may learn your statutes.<br>
<sup>72</sup> The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.

<sup>73</sup> Your hands have made me and formed me.<br>Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.<br>
<sup>74</sup> Those who fear you will see me and be glad,<br>because I have put my hope in your word.<br>
<sup>75</sup> Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous,<br>that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.<br>
<sup>76</sup> Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort,<br>according to your word to your servant.<br>
<sup>77</sup> Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;<br>for your law is my delight.<br>
<sup>78</sup> Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown me wrongfully.<br>I will meditate on your precepts.<br>
<sup>79</sup> Let those who fear you turn to me.<br>They will know your statutes.<br>
<sup>80</sup> Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees,<br>that I may not be disappointed.

<sup>81</sup> My soul faints for your salvation.<br>I hope in your word.<br>
<sup>82</sup> My eyes fail for your word.<br>I say, “When will you comfort me?”<br>
<sup>83</sup> For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.<br>I don’t forget your statutes.<br>
<sup>84</sup> How many are the days of your servant?<br>When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?<br>
<sup>85</sup> The proud have dug pits for me,<br>contrary to your law.<br>
<sup>86</sup> All of your commandments are faithful.<br>They persecute me wrongfully.<br>Help me!<br>
<sup>87</sup> They had almost wiped me from the earth,<br>but I didn’t forsake your precepts.<br>
<sup>88</sup> Preserve my life according to your loving kindness,<br>so I will obey the statutes of your mouth.

<sup>89</sup> Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.<br>
<sup>90</sup> Your faithfulness is to all generations.<br>You have established the earth, and it remains.<br>
<sup>91</sup> Your laws remain to this day,<br>for all things serve you.<br>
<sup>92</sup> Unless your law had been my delight,<br>I would have perished in my affliction.<br>
<sup>93</sup> I will never forget your precepts,<br>for with them, you have revived me.<br>
<sup>94</sup> I am yours.<br>Save me, for I have sought your precepts.<br>
<sup>95</sup> The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.<br>I will consider your statutes.<br>
<sup>96</sup> I have seen a limit to all perfection,<br>but your commands are boundless.

<sup>97</sup> How I love your law!<br>It is my meditation all day.<br>
<sup>98</sup> Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,<br>for your commandments are always with me.<br>
<sup>99</sup> I have more understanding than all my teachers,<br>for your testimonies are my meditation.<br>
<sup>100</sup> I understand more than the aged,<br>because I have kept your precepts.<br>
<sup>101</sup> I have kept my feet from every evil way,<br>that I might observe your word.<br>
<sup>102</sup> I have not turned away from your ordinances,<br>for you have taught me.<br>
<sup>103</sup> How sweet are your promises to my taste,<br>more than honey to my mouth!<br>
<sup>104</sup> Through your precepts, I get understanding;<br>therefore I hate every false way.

<sup>105</sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet,<br>and a light for my path.<br>
<sup>106</sup> I have sworn, and have confirmed it,<br>that I will obey your righteous ordinances.<br>
<sup>107</sup> I am afflicted very much.<br>Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.<br>
<sup>108</sup> Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.<br>Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.<br>

<sup>112</sup> I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,<br>even to the end.

<sup>113</sup> I hate double-minded men,<br>but I love your law.<br>
<sup>114</sup> You are my hiding place and my shield.<br>I hope in your word.<br>
<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, you evildoers,<br>that I may keep the commandments of my God.<br>
<sup>116</sup> Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.<br>Let me not be ashamed of my hope.<br>
<sup>117</sup> Hold me up, and I will be safe,<br>and will have respect for your statutes continually.<br>
<sup>118</sup> You reject all those who stray from your statutes,<br>for their deceit is in vain.<br>
<sup>119</sup> You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.<br>Therefore I love your testimonies.<br>
<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembles for fear of you.<br>I am afraid of your judgments.

<sup>121</sup> I have done what is just and righteous.<br>Don’t leave me to my oppressors.<br>
<sup>122</sup> Ensure your servant’s well-being.<br>Don’t let the proud oppress me.<br>
<sup>123</sup> My eyes fail looking for your salvation,<br>for your righteous word.<br>
<sup>124</sup> Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.<br>Teach me your statutes.<br>
<sup>125</sup> I am your servant. Give me understanding,<br>that I may know your testimonies.<br>
<sup>126</sup> It is time to act, Yahweh,<br>for they break your law.<br>
<sup>127</sup> Therefore I love your commandments more than gold,<br>yes, more than pure gold.<br>
<sup>128</sup> Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.<br>I hate every false way.

<sup>129</sup> Your testimonies are wonderful,<br>therefore my soul keeps them.<br>
<sup>130</sup> The entrance of your words gives light.<br>It gives understanding to the simple.<br>
<sup>131</sup> I opened my mouth wide and panted,<br>for I longed for your commandments.<br>
<sup>132</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br>as you always do to those who love your name.<br>
<sup>133</sup> Establish my footsteps in your word.<br>Don’t let any iniquity have dominion over me.<br>
<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man,<br>so I will observe your precepts.<br>
<sup>135</sup> Make your face shine on your servant.<br>Teach me your statutes.<br>
<sup>136</sup> Streams of tears run down my eyes,<br>because they don’t observe your law.

<sup>137</sup> You are righteous, Yahweh.<br>Your judgments are upright.<br>
<sup>138</sup> You have commanded your statutes in righteousness.<br>They are fully trustworthy.<br>
<sup>139</sup> My zeal wears me out,<br>because my enemies ignore your words.<br>
<sup>140</sup> Your promises have been thoroughly tested,<br>and your servant loves them.<br>
<sup>141</sup> I am small and despised.<br>I don’t forget your precepts.<br>
<sup>142</sup> Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.<br>Your law is truth.<br>
<sup>143</sup> Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me.<br>Your commandments are my delight.<br>
<sup>144</sup> Your testimonies are righteous forever.<br>Give me understanding, that I may live.

<sup>145</sup> I have called with my whole heart.<br>Answer me, Yahweh!<br>I will keep your statutes.<br>
<sup>146</sup> I have called to you. Save me!<br>I will obey your statutes.<br>
<sup>147</sup> I rise before dawn and cry for help.<br>I put my hope in your words.<br>

<sup>149</sup> Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.<br>Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.<br>
<sup>150</sup> They draw near who follow after wickedness.<br>They are far from your law.<br>
<sup>151</sup> You are near, Yahweh.<br>All your commandments are truth.<br>
<sup>152</sup> Of old I have known from your testimonies,<br>that you have founded them forever.

<sup>153</sup> Consider my affliction, and deliver me,<br>for I don’t forget your law.<br>
<sup>154</sup> Plead my cause, and redeem me!<br>Revive me according to your promise.<br>
<sup>155</sup> Salvation is far from the wicked,<br>for they don’t seek your statutes.<br>
<sup>156</sup> Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.<br>Revive me according to your ordinances.<br>
<sup>157</sup> Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.<br>I haven’t swerved from your testimonies.<br>
<sup>158</sup> I look at the faithless with loathing,<br>because they don’t observe your word.<br>
<sup>159</sup> Consider how I love your precepts.<br>Revive me, Yahweh, according to your loving kindness.<br>
<sup>160</sup> All of your words are truth.<br>Every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever.

<sup>161</sup> Princes have persecuted me without a cause,<br>but my heart stands in awe of your words.<br>
<sup>162</sup> I rejoice at your word,<br>as one who finds great plunder.<br>
<sup>163</sup> I hate and abhor falsehood.<br>I love your law.<br>

<sup>168</sup> I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies,<br>for all my ways are before you.

<sup>169</sup> Let my cry come before you, Yahweh.<br>Give me understanding according to your word.<br>
<sup>170</sup> Let my supplication come before you.<br>Deliver me according to your word.<br>
<sup>171</sup> Let my lips utter praise,<br>for you teach me your statutes.<br>

## Chapter 120

<sup>1</sup> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.<br>He answered me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips,<br>from a deceitful tongue.<br>
<sup>3</sup> What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,<br>you deceitful tongue?<br>
<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty,<br>with coals of juniper.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,<br>that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!<br>
<sup>6</sup> My soul has had her dwelling too long<br>with him who hates peace.<br>
<sup>7</sup> I am for peace,<br>but when I speak, they are for war.
## Chapter 121

<sup>1</sup> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.<br>Where does my help come from?<br>
<sup>2</sup> My help comes from Yahweh,<br>who made heaven and earth.

<sup>3</sup> He will not allow your foot to be moved.<br>He who keeps you will not slumber.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, he who keeps Israel<br>will neither slumber nor sleep.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh is your keeper.<br>Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The sun will not harm you by day,<br>nor the moon by night.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh will keep you from all evil.<br>He will keep your soul.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in,<br>from this time forward, and forever more.
## Chapter 122

<sup>1</sup> I was glad when they said to me,<br>“Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”<br>
<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem!<br>
<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together,<br>
<sup>4</sup> where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes,<br>according to an ordinance for Israel,<br>to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment,<br>the thrones of David’s house.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.<br>Those who love you will prosper.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Peace be within your walls,<br>and prosperity within your palaces.<br>
<sup>8</sup> For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,<br>I will now say, “Peace be within you.”<br>
<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,<br>I will seek your good.
## Chapter 123

<sup>1</sup> I lift up my eyes to you,<br>you who sit in the heavens.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,<br>as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,<br>so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,<br>until he has mercy on us.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,<br>for we have endured much contempt.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,<br>with the contempt of the proud.
## Chapter 124

<sup>1</sup> If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,<br>let Israel now say,<br>
<sup>2</sup> if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,<br>when men rose up against us,<br>
<sup>3</sup> then they would have swallowed us up alive,<br>when their wrath was kindled against us,<br>
<sup>4</sup> then the waters would have overwhelmed us,<br>the stream would have gone over our soul.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh,<br>who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.<br>The snare is broken, and we have escaped.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Our help is in Yahweh’s name,<br>who made heaven and earth.
## Chapter 125

<sup>1</sup> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,<br>which can’t be moved, but remains forever.<br>
<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br>so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous,<br>so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,<br>to those who are upright in their hearts.<br>
<sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,<br>Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.<br>Peace be on Israel.
## Chapter 126

<sup>1</sup> When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,<br>we were like those who dream.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br>and our tongue with singing.<br>Then they said among the nations,<br>“Yahweh has done great things for them.”<br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh has done great things for us,<br>and we are glad.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,<br>like the streams in the Negev.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,<br>will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
## Chapter 127

<sup>1</sup> Unless Yahweh builds the house,<br>they who build it labor in vain.<br>Unless Yahweh watches over the city,<br>the watchman guards it in vain.<br>
<sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early,<br>to stay up late,<br>eating the bread of toil,<br>for he gives sleep to his loved ones.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.<br>The fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,<br>so are the children of youth.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.<br>They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
## Chapter 128

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,<br>who walks in his ways.<br>
<sup>2</sup> For you will eat the labor of your hands.<br>You will be happy, and it will be well with you.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house,<br>your children like olive shoots around your table.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, this is how the man who fears Yahweh is blessed.<br>
<sup>5</sup> May Yahweh bless you out of Zion,<br>and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Yes, may you see your children’s children.<br>Peace be upon Israel.
## Chapter 129

<sup>1</sup> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.<br>Let Israel now say:<br>
<sup>2</sup> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,<br>yet they have not prevailed against me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back.<br>They made their furrows long.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is righteous.<br>He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be disappointed and turned backward,<br>all those who hate Zion.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops,<br>which withers before it grows up,<br>
<sup>7</sup> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,<br>nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say,<br>“The blessing of Yahweh be on you.<br>We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
## Chapter 130

<sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice.<br>Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.<br>
<sup>3</sup> If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,<br>Lord, who could stand?<br>
<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with you,<br>therefore you are feared.<br>
<sup>5</sup> I wait for Yahweh.<br>My soul waits.<br>I hope in his word.<br>
<sup>6</sup> My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning,<br>more than watchmen for the morning.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh,<br>for there is loving kindness with Yahweh.<br>Abundant redemption is with him.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
## Chapter 131

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;<br>nor do I concern myself with great matters,<br>or things too wonderful for me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,<br>like a weaned child with his mother,<br>like a weaned child is my soul within me.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh,<br>from this time forward and forever more.
## Chapter 132

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,<br>
<sup>2</sup> how he swore to Yahweh,<br>and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:<br>
<sup>3</sup> “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,<br>nor go up into my bed;<br>
<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes,<br>or slumber to my eyelids,<br>
<sup>5</sup> until I find out a place for Yahweh,<br>a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”<br>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.<br>We found it in the field of Jaar.<br>
<sup>7</sup> “We will go into his dwelling place.<br>We will worship at his footstool.”<br>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place,<br>you, and the ark of your strength.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.<br>Let your saints shout for joy!<br>
<sup>10</sup> For your servant David’s sake,<br>don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.<br>He will not turn from it:<br>“I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.<br>
<sup>12</sup> If your children will keep my covenant,<br>my testimony that I will teach them,<br>their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”<br>
<sup>13</sup> For Yahweh has chosen Zion.<br>He has desired it for his habitation.<br>
<sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place forever.<br>I will live here, for I have desired it.<br>
<sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision.<br>I will satisfy her poor with bread.<br>
<sup>16</sup> I will also clothe her priests with salvation.<br>Her saints will shout aloud for joy.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I will make the horn of David to bud there.<br>I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.<br>
<sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame,<br>but on himself, his crown will shine.”
## Chapter 133

<sup>1</sup> See how good and how pleasant it is<br>for brothers to live together in unity!<br>
<sup>2</sup> It is like the precious oil on the head,<br>that ran down on the beard,<br>even Aaron’s beard,<br>that came down on the edge of his robes,<br>
<sup>3</sup> like the dew of Hermon,<br>that comes down on the hills of Zion;<br>for there Yahweh gives the blessing,<br>even life forever more.
## Chapter 134

<sup>1</sup> Look! Praise Yahweh, all you servants of Yahweh,<br>who stand by night in Yahweh’s house!<br>
<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.<br>Praise Yahweh!<br>
<sup>3</sup> May Yahweh bless you from Zion,<br>even he who made heaven and earth.
## Chapter 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah!<br>Praise Yahweh’s name!<br>Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,<br>
<sup>2</sup> you who stand in Yahweh’s house,<br>in the courts of our God’s house.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.<br>Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself,<br>Israel for his own possession.<br>
<sup>5</sup> For I know that Yahweh is great,<br>that our Lord is above all gods.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done,<br>in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.<br>He makes lightnings with the rain.<br>He brings the wind out of his treasuries.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He struck the firstborn of Egypt,<br>both of man and animal.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt,<br>on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.<br>
<sup>10</sup> He struck many nations,<br>and killed mighty kings—<br>
<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites,<br>Og king of Bashan,<br>and all the kingdoms of Canaan—<br>
<sup>12</sup> and gave their land for a heritage,<br>a heritage to Israel, his people.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Your name, Yahweh, endures forever;<br>your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh will judge his people<br>and have compassion on his servants.

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold,<br>the work of men’s hands.<br>
<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they can’t speak.<br>They have eyes, but they can’t see.<br>
<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they can’t hear,<br>neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Those who make them will be like them,<br>yes, everyone who trusts in them.<br>
<sup>19</sup> House of Israel, praise Yahweh!<br>House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!<br>
<sup>20</sup> House of Levi, praise Yahweh!<br>You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!<br>
<sup>21</sup> Blessed be Yahweh from Zion,<br>who dwells in Jerusalem.<br>Praise Yah!

<sup>11</sup> and brought out Israel from among them,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>12</sup> with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>13</sup> to him who divided the Red Sea apart,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>14</sup> and made Israel to pass through the middle of it,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>15</sup> but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>16</sup> to him who led his people through the wilderness,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>17</sup> to him who struck great kings,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>18</sup> and killed mighty kings,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>19</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>20</sup> Og king of Bashan,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>21</sup> and gave their land as an inheritance,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>22</sup> even a heritage to Israel his servant,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>23</sup> who remembered us in our low estate,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>24</sup> and has delivered us from our adversaries,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever;<br>
<sup>25</sup> who gives food to every creature,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Oh give thanks to the God of heaven,<br>for his loving kindness endures forever.
## Chapter 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.<br>Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<br>
<sup>2</sup> On the willows in that land,<br>we hung up our harps.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.<br>Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:<br>“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”<br>
<sup>4</sup> How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land?<br>
<sup>5</sup> If I forget you, Jerusalem,<br>let my right hand forget its skill.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,<br>if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,<br>who said, “Raze it!<br>Raze it even to its foundation!”<br>
<sup>8</sup> Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,<br>he will be happy who repays you,<br>as you have done to us.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be,<br>who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
## Chapter 138

<sup>1</sup> I will give you thanks with my whole heart.<br>Before the gods,<sup>a</sup> I will sing praises to you.<br>
<sup>2</sup> I will bow down toward your holy temple,<br>and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;<br>for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.<br>
<sup>3</sup> In the day that I called, you answered me.<br>You encouraged me with strength in my soul.<br>
<sup>4</sup> All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,<br>for they have heard the words of your mouth.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh,<br>for Yahweh’s glory is great!<br>

## Chapter 139

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have searched me,<br>and you know me.<br>
<sup>2</sup> You know my sitting down and my rising up.<br>You perceive my thoughts from afar.<br>
<sup>3</sup> You search out my path and my lying down,<br>and are acquainted with all my ways.<br>
<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue,<br>but behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.<br>

<sup>10</sup> even there your hand will lead me,<br>and your right hand will hold me.<br>
<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.<br>The light around me will be night,”<br>
<sup>12</sup> even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,<br>but the night shines as the day.<br>The darkness is like light to you.<br>
<sup>13</sup> For you formed my inmost being.<br>You knit me together in my mother’s womb.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I will give thanks to you,<br>for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br>Your works are wonderful.<br>My soul knows that very well.<br>
<sup>15</sup> My frame wasn’t hidden from you,<br>when I was made in secret,<br>woven together in the depths of the earth.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my body.<br>In your book they were all written,<br>the days that were ordained for me,<br>when as yet there were none of them.<br>
<sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God!<br>How vast is their sum!<br>
<sup>18</sup> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.<br>When I wake up, I am still with you.<br>
<sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would kill the wicked.<br>Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!<br>
<sup>20</sup> For they speak against you wickedly.<br>Your enemies take your name in vain.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you?<br>Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?<br>
<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred.<br>They have become my enemies.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart.<br>Try me, and know my thoughts.<br>
