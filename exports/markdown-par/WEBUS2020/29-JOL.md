## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh’s<sup>a</sup> word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear this, you elders,<br>and listen, all you inhabitants of the land!<br>Has this ever happened in your days,<br>or in the days of your fathers?<br>
<sup>3</sup> Tell your children about it,<br>and have your children tell their children,<br>and their children, another generation.<br>
<sup>4</sup> What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.<br>What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.<br>What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!<br>Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine,<br>for it is cut off from your mouth.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.<br>His teeth are the teeth of a lion,<br>and he has the fangs of a lioness.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He has laid my vine waste,<br>and stripped my fig tree.<br>He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.<br>Its branches are made white.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth<br>for the husband of her youth!<br>
<sup>9</sup> The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house.<br>The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The field is laid waste.<br>The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,<br>The new wine has dried up,<br>and the oil languishes.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Be confounded, you farmers!<br>Wail, you vineyard keepers,<br>for the wheat and for the barley;<br>for the harvest of the field has perished.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered—<br>the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,<br>even all of the trees of the field are withered;<br>for joy has withered away from the sons of men.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!<br>Wail, you ministers of the altar.<br>Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,<sup>b</sup><br>for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Sanctify a fast.<br>Call a solemn assembly.<br>Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh, your God,<br>and cry to Yahweh.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Alas for the day!<br>For the day of Yahweh is at hand,<br>and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes,<br>joy and gladness from the house of our God?<br>
<sup>17</sup> The seeds rot under their clods.<br>The granaries are laid desolate.<br>The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.<br>
<sup>18</sup> How the animals groan!<br>The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.<br>Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Yahweh, I cry to you,<br>for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,<br>and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,<br>for the water brooks have dried up,<br>and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
> - <sup>b</sup> 13. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion,<br>and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!<br>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,<br>for the day of Yahweh comes,<br>for it is close at hand:<br>
<sup>2</sup> A day of darkness and gloominess,<br>a day of clouds and thick darkness.<br>As the dawn spreading on the mountains,<br>a great and strong people;<br>there has never been the like,<br>neither will there be any more after them,<br>even to the years of many generations.<br>
<sup>3</sup> A fire devours before them,<br>and behind them, a flame burns.<br>The land is as the garden of Eden before them,<br>and behind them, a desolate wilderness.<br>Yes, and no one has escaped them.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,<br>and they run as horsemen.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,<br>like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,<br>like a strong people set in battle array.<br>
<sup>6</sup> At their presence the peoples are in anguish.<br>All faces have grown pale.<br>
<sup>7</sup> They run like mighty men.<br>They climb the wall like warriors.<br>They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.<br>
<sup>8</sup> One doesn’t jostle another.<br>They each march in their own path.<br>They burst through the defenses<br>and don’t break ranks.<br>
<sup>9</sup> They rush on the city.<br>They run on the wall.<br>They climb up into the houses.<br>They enter in at the windows like thieves.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The earth quakes before them.<br>The heavens tremble.<br>The sun and the moon are darkened,<br>and the stars withdraw their shining.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh thunders his voice before his army,<br>for his forces are very great;<br>for he is strong who obeys his command;<br>for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,<br>and who can endure it?<br>
<sup>12</sup> “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,<br>and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”<br>
<sup>13</sup> Tear your heart and not your garments,<br>and turn to Yahweh, your God;<br>for he is gracious and merciful,<br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,<br>and relents from sending calamity.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Who knows? He may turn and relent,<br>and leave a blessing behind him,<br>even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion!<br>Sanctify a fast.<br>Call a solemn assembly.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Gather the people.<br>Sanctify the assembly.<br>Assemble the elders.<br>Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.<br>Let the bridegroom go out of his room,<br>and the bride out of her chamber.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,<br>and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,<br>and don’t give your heritage to reproach,<br>that the nations should rule over them.<br>Why should they say among the peoples,<br>‘Where is their God?’ ”<br>
<sup>18</sup> Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,<br>and had pity on his people.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Yahweh answered his people,<br>“Behold,<sup>a</sup> I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,<br>and you will be satisfied with them;<br>and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.<br>
<sup>20</sup> But I will remove the northern army far away from you,<br>and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,<br>its front into the eastern sea,<br>and its back into the western sea;<br>and its stench will come up,<br>and its bad smell will rise.”<br>Surely he has done great things.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Land, don’t be afraid.<br>Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;<br>for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,<br>for the tree bears its fruit.<br>The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.

<sup>23</sup> “Be glad then, you children of Zion,<br>and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;<br>for he gives you the early rain in just measure,<br>and he causes the rain to come down for you,<br>the early rain and the latter rain, as before.<br>
<sup>24</sup> The threshing floors will be full of wheat,<br>and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.<br>
<sup>25</sup> I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,<br>the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,<br>my great army, which I sent among you.<br>
<sup>26</sup> You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,<br>and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,<br>who has dealt wondrously with you;<br>and my people will never again be disappointed.<br>
<sup>27</sup> You will know that I am among Israel,<br>and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;<br>and my people will never again be disappointed.

<sup>28</sup> “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;<br>and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.<br>Your old men will dream dreams.<br>Your young men will see visions.<br>
<sup>29</sup> And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,<br>I will pour out my Spirit.<br>
<sup>30</sup> I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:<br>blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.<br>
<sup>31</sup> The sun will be turned into darkness,<br>and the moon into blood,<br>before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.<br>
<sup>32</sup> It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;<br>for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,<br>as Yahweh has said,<br>and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.

> - <sup>a</sup> 19. “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> “For, behold, in those days,<br>and in that time,<br>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,<br>
<sup>2</sup> I will gather all nations,<br>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br>and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,<br>and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.<br>They have divided my land,<br>
<sup>3</sup> and have cast lots for my people,<br>and have given a boy for a prostitute,<br>and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.

<sup>4</sup> “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon,<br>and all the regions of Philistia?<br>Will you repay me?<br>And if you repay me,<br>I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Because you have taken my silver and my gold,<br>and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,<br>
<sup>6</sup> and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,<br>that you may remove them far from their border.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,<br>and will return your repayment on your own head;<br>
<sup>8</sup> and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,<br>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,<br>to a faraway nation,<br>for Yahweh has spoken it.”

<sup>9</sup> Proclaim this among the nations:<br>“Prepare for war!<br>Stir up the mighty men.<br>Let all the warriors draw near.<br>Let them come up.
<sup>10</sup> Beat your plowshares into swords,<br>and your pruning hooks into spears.<br>Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’<br>
<sup>11</sup> Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,<br>and gather yourselves together.”<br>Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.<br>
<sup>12</sup> “Let the nations arouse themselves,<br>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br>for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Put in the sickle;<br>for the harvest is ripe.<br>Come, tread, for the wine press is full,<br>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”<br>
<sup>14</sup> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!<br>For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The sun and the moon are darkened,<br>and the stars withdraw their shining.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh will roar from Zion,<br>and thunder from Jerusalem;<br>and the heavens and the earth will shake;<br>but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,<br>and a stronghold to the children of Israel.<br>
<sup>17</sup> “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,<br>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.<br>Then Jerusalem will be holy,<br>and no strangers will pass through her any more.<br>
<sup>18</sup> It will happen in that day,<br>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,<br>the hills will flow with milk,<br>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;<br>and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,<br>and will water the valley of Shittim.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Egypt will be a desolation<br>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,<br>for the violence done to the children of Judah,<br>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.<br>
<sup>20</sup> But Judah will be inhabited forever,<br>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.<br>
<sup>21</sup> I will cleanse their blood<br>that I have not cleansed,<br>for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”
