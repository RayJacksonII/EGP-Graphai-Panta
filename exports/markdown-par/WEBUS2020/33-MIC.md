## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh’s<sup>a</sup> word that came to Micah of Morasheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear, you peoples, all of you!<br>Listen, O earth, and all that is therein.<br>Let the Lord<sup>b</sup> Yahweh be witness against you,<br>the Lord from his holy temple.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For behold,<sup>c</sup> Yahweh comes out of his place,<br>and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The mountains melt under him,<br>and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire,<br>like waters that are poured down a steep place.

<sup>5</sup> “All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,<br>and for the sins of the house of Israel.<br>What is the disobedience of Jacob?<br>Isn’t it Samaria?<br>And what are the high places of Judah?<br>Aren’t they Jerusalem?<br>
<sup>6</sup> Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,<br>like places for planting vineyards;<br>and I will pour down its stones into the valley,<br>and I will uncover its foundations.<br>
<sup>7</sup> All her idols will be beaten to pieces,<br>all her temple gifts will be burned with fire,<br>and I will destroy all her images;<br>for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,<br>and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”

<sup>8</sup> For this I will lament and wail.<br>I will go stripped and naked.<br>I will howl like the jackals<br>and mourn like the ostriches.<br>
<sup>9</sup> For her wounds are incurable;<br>for it has come even to Judah.<br>It reaches to the gate of my people,<br>even to Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t tell it in Gath.<br>Don’t weep at all.<br>At Beth Ophrah<sup>d</sup> I have rolled myself in the dust.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.<br>The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out.<br>The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.<br>
<sup>12</sup> For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,<br>because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.<br>She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;<br>for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.<br>The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.<br>
<sup>15</sup> I will yet bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah.<br>The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Shave your heads,<br>and cut off your hair for the children of your delight.<br>Enlarge your baldness like the vulture,<br>for they have gone into captivity from you!

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Woe to those who devise iniquity<br>and work evil on their beds!<br>When the morning is light, they practice it,<br>because it is in the power of their hand.<br>
<sup>2</sup> They covet fields and seize them,<br>and houses, then take them away.<br>They oppress a man and his house,<br>even a man and his heritage.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Therefore Yahweh says:<br>“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,<br>from which you will not remove your necks,<br>neither will you walk haughtily,<br>for it is an evil time.<br>
<sup>4</sup> In that day they will take up a parable against you,<br>and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,<br>‘We are utterly ruined!<br>My people’s possession is divided up.<br>Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’ ”<br>
<sup>5</sup> Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly.<br>
<sup>6</sup> “Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—<br>“Don’t prophesy about these things.<br>Disgrace won’t overtake us.”<br>
<sup>7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob,<br>“Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry?<br>Are these his doings?<br>Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”<br>
<sup>8</sup> But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.<br>You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.<br>
<sup>9</sup> You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;<br>from their young children you take away my blessing forever.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Arise, and depart!<br>For this is not your resting place,<br>because of uncleanness that destroys,<br>even with a grievous destruction.<br>
<sup>11</sup> If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying,<br>“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,”<br>he would be the prophet of this people.<br>
<sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.<br>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.<br>I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,<br>as a flock in the middle of their pasture.<br>They will swarm with people.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He who breaks open the way goes up before them.<br>They break through the gate, and go out.<br>Their king passes on before them,<br>with Yahweh at their head.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I said,<br>“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,<br>and rulers of the house of Israel:<br>Isn’t it for you to know justice?<br>
<sup>2</sup> You who hate the good,<br>and love the evil;<br>who tear off their skin,<br>and their flesh from off their bones;<br>
<sup>3</sup> who also eat the flesh of my people,<br>and peel their skin from off them,<br>and break their bones,<br>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,<br>and as meat within the cauldron.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Then they will cry to Yahweh,<br>but he will not answer them.<br>Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,<br>because they made their deeds evil.”

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:<br>
<sup>6</sup> “Therefore night is over you, with no vision,<br>and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;<br>and the sun will go down on the prophets,<br>and the day will be black over them.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The seers shall be disappointed,<br>and the diviners confounded.<br>Yes, they shall all cover their lips,<br>for there is no answer from God.”<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit,<br>and of judgment, and of might,<br>to declare to Jacob his disobedience,<br>and to Israel his sin.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,<br>and rulers of the house of Israel,<br>who abhor justice,<br>and pervert all equity,<br>
<sup>10</sup> who build up Zion with blood,<br>and Jerusalem with iniquity.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Her leaders judge for bribes,<br>and her priests teach for a price,<br>and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money;<br>yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,<br>“Isn’t Yahweh among us?<br>No disaster will come on us.”<br>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,<br>and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,<br>and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.

> - <sup>a</sup> 7. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).

## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> But in the latter days,<br>it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,<br>and it will be exalted above the hills;<br>and peoples will stream to it.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Many nations will go and say,<br>“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,<br>and to the house of the God of Jacob;<br>and he will teach us of his ways,<br>and we will walk in his paths.”<br>For the law will go out of Zion,<br>and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;<br>
<sup>3</sup> and he will judge between many peoples,<br>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.<br>They will beat their swords into plowshares,<br>and their spears into pruning hooks.<br>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br>neither will they learn war any more.<br>
<sup>4</sup> But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree.<br>No one will make them afraid,<br>for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
<sup>5</sup> Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods,<br>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.<br>
<sup>6</sup> “In that day,” says Yahweh,<br>“I will assemble that which is lame,<br>and I will gather that which is driven away,<br>and that which I have afflicted;<br>
<sup>7</sup> and I will make that which was lame a remnant,<br>and that which was cast far off a strong nation:<br>and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”<br>
<sup>8</sup> You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,<br>to you it will come.<br>Yes, the former dominion will come,<br>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

<sup>9</sup> Now why do you cry out aloud?<br>Is there no king in you?<br>Has your counselor perished,<br>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?<br>
<sup>10</sup> Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,<br>like a woman in travail;<br>for now you will go out of the city,<br>and will dwell in the field,<br>and will come even to Babylon.<br>There you will be rescued.<br>There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

<sup>11</sup> Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,<br>“Let her be defiled,<br>and let our eye gloat over Zion.”<br>
<sup>12</sup> But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,<br>neither do they understand his counsel;<br>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,<br>for I will make your horn iron,<br>and I will make your hoofs bronze.<br>You will beat in pieces many peoples.<br>I will devote their gain to Yahweh,<br>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Now you shall gather yourself in troops,<br>daughter of troops.<br>He has laid siege against us.<br>They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.<br>
<sup>2</sup> But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,<br>being small among the clans of Judah,<br>out of you one will come out to me who is to be ruler in Israel;<br>whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth.<br>Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh,<br>in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God.<br>They will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land<br>and when he marches through our fortresses,<br>then we will raise against him seven shepherds,<br>and eight leaders of men.<br>
<sup>6</sup> They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,<br>and the land of Nimrod in its gates.<br>He will deliver us from the Assyrian,<br>when he invades our land,<br>and when he marches within our border.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples<br>like dew from Yahweh,<br>like showers on the grass,<br>that don’t wait for man<br>nor wait for the sons of men.<br>
<sup>8</sup> The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,<br>among many peoples,<br>like a lion among the animals of the forest,<br>like a young lion among the flocks of sheep;<br>who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces,<br>and there is no one to deliver.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries,<br>and let all of your enemies be cut off.<br>
<sup>10</sup> “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh,<br>“that I will cut off your horses from among you<br>and will destroy your chariots.<br>
<sup>11</sup> I will cut off the cities of your land<br>and will tear down all your strongholds.<br>
<sup>12</sup> I will destroy witchcraft from your hand.<br>You shall have no soothsayers.<br>
<sup>13</sup> I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars from among you;<br>and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I will uproot your Asherah poles from among you;<br>and I will destroy your cities.<br>
<sup>15</sup> I will execute vengeance in anger<br>and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”
## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Listen now to what Yahweh says:<br>“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,<br>and let the hills hear what you have to say.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment,<br>and you enduring foundations of the earth;<br>for Yahweh has a case against his people,<br>and he will contend with Israel.<br>
<sup>3</sup> My people, what have I done to you?<br>How have I burdened you?<br>Answer me!<br>
<sup>4</sup> For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,<br>and redeemed you out of the house of bondage.<br>I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.<br>
<sup>5</sup> My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,<br>and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal,<br>that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.”

<sup>6</sup> How shall I come before Yahweh,<br>and bow myself before the exalted God?<br>Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,<br>with calves a year old?<br>
<sup>7</sup> Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams?<br>With tens of thousands of rivers of oil?<br>Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?<br>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?<br>
<sup>8</sup> He has shown you, O man, what is good.<br>What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly,<br>to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice calls to the city—<br>and wisdom fears your name—<br>“Listen to the rod,<br>and he who appointed it.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,<br>and a short ephah<sup>a</sup> that is accursed?<br>
<sup>11</sup> Shall I tolerate dishonest scales,<br>and a bag of deceitful weights?<br>
<sup>12</sup> Her rich men are full of violence,<br>her inhabitants speak lies,<br>and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.<br>I have made you desolate because of your sins.<br>
<sup>14</sup> You shall eat, but not be satisfied.<br>Your hunger will be within you.<br>You will store up, but not save,<br>and that which you save I will give up to the sword.<br>
<sup>15</sup> You will sow, but won’t reap.<br>You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil;<br>and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept,<br>and all the works of Ahab’s house.<br>You walk in their counsels,<br>that I may make you a ruin,<br>and your inhabitants a hissing.<br>You will bear the reproach of my people.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 10. An ephah is a measure of volume (about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel), and a short ephah is made smaller than a full ephah for the purpose of cheating customers.

## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Misery is mine!<br>Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard.<br>There is no cluster of grapes to eat.<br>My soul desires to eat the early fig.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The godly man has perished out of the earth,<br>and there is no one upright among men.<br>They all lie in wait for blood;<br>every man hunts his brother with a net.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.<br>The ruler and judge ask for a bribe.<br>The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.<br>Thus they conspire together.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The best of them is like a brier.<br>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.<br>The day of your watchmen,<br>even your visitation, has come;<br>now is the time of their confusion.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t trust in a neighbor.<br>Don’t put confidence in a friend.<br>With the woman lying in your embrace,<br>be careful of the words of your mouth!<br>
<sup>6</sup> For the son dishonors the father,<br>the daughter rises up against her mother,<br>the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br>a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.<br>
<sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.<br>I will wait for the God of my salvation.<br>My God will hear me.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.<br>When I fall, I will arise.<br>When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.<br>
<sup>9</sup> I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,<br>because I have sinned against him,<br>until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me.<br>He will bring me out to the light.<br>I will see his righteousness.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Then my enemy will see it,<br>and shame will cover her who said to me,<br>“Where is Yahweh your God?”<br>My eyes will see her.<br>Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.<br>
<sup>11</sup> A day to build your walls!<br>In that day, he will extend your boundary.<br>
<sup>12</sup> In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br>and from Egypt even to the River,<br>and from sea to sea,<br>and mountain to mountain.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,<br>for the fruit of their doings.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Shepherd your people with your staff,<br>the flock of your heritage,<br>who dwell by themselves in a forest.<br>Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land,<br>in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br>
<sup>15</sup> “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,<br>I will show them marvelous things.”<br>
<sup>16</sup> The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.<br>They will lay their hand on their mouth.<br>Their ears will be deaf.<br>
<sup>17</sup> They will lick the dust like a serpent.<br>Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens.<br>They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,<br>and will be afraid because of you.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,<br>and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?<br>He doesn’t retain his anger forever,<br>because he delights in loving kindness.<br>
<sup>19</sup> He will again have compassion on us.<br>He will tread our iniquities under foot.<br>You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br>
<sup>20</sup> You will give truth to Jacob,<br>and mercy to Abraham,<br>as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
