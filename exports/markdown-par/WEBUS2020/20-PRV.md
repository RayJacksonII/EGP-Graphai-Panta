## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:<br>
<sup>2</sup> to know wisdom and instruction;<br>to discern the words of understanding;<br>
<sup>3</sup> to receive instruction in wise dealing,<br>in righteousness, justice, and equity;<br>
<sup>4</sup> to give prudence to the simple,<br>knowledge and discretion to the young man—<br>
<sup>5</sup> that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;<br>that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;<br>
<sup>6</sup> to understand a proverb and parables,<br>the words and riddles of the wise.

<sup>7</sup> The fear of Yahweh<sup>a</sup> is the beginning of knowledge,<br>but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.<br>
<sup>8</sup> My son, listen to your father’s instruction,<br>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching;<br>
<sup>9</sup> for they will be a garland to grace your head,<br>and chains around your neck.<br>
<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you,<br>don’t consent.<br>
<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us.<br>Let’s lie in wait for blood.<br>Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,<sup>b</sup><br>and whole, like those who go down into the pit.<br>
<sup>13</sup> We’ll find all valuable wealth.<br>We’ll fill our houses with plunder.<br>
<sup>14</sup> You shall cast your lot among us.<br>We’ll all have one purse”—<br>
<sup>15</sup> my son, don’t walk on the path with them.<br>Keep your foot from their path,<br>
<sup>16</sup> for their feet run to evil.<br>They hurry to shed blood.<br>
<sup>17</sup> For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;<br>
<sup>18</sup> but these lay in wait for their own blood.<br>They lurk secretly for their own lives.<br>
<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.<br>It takes away the life of its owners.

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street.<br>She utters her voice in the public squares.<br>
<sup>21</sup> She calls at the head of noisy places.<br>At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:<br>
<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?<br>How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,<br>and fools hate knowledge?<br>
<sup>23</sup> Turn at my reproof.<br>Behold,<sup>c</sup> I will pour out my spirit on you.<br>I will make known my words to you.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and you have refused;<br>I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;<br>
<sup>25</sup> but you have ignored all my counsel,<br>and wanted none of my reproof;<br>
<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your disaster.<br>I will mock when calamity overtakes you,<br>
<sup>27</sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br>when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,<br>when distress and anguish come on you.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.<br>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,<br>
<sup>29</sup> because they hated knowledge,<br>and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.<br>
<sup>30</sup> They wanted none of my counsel.<br>They despised all my reproof.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,<br>and be filled with their own schemes.<br>
<sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.<br>The careless ease of fools will destroy them.<br>
<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,<br>and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 7. “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
> - <sup>b</sup> 12. Sheol is the place of the dead.
> - <sup>c</sup> 23. “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you will receive my words,<br>and store up my commandments within you,<br>
<sup>2</sup> so as to turn your ear to wisdom,<br>and apply your heart to understanding;<br>
<sup>3</sup> yes, if you call out for discernment,<br>and lift up your voice for understanding;<br>
<sup>4</sup> if you seek her as silver,<br>and search for her as for hidden treasures;<br>
<sup>5</sup> then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,<br>and find the knowledge of God.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>6</sup> For Yahweh gives wisdom.<br>Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.<br>He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,<br>
<sup>8</sup> that he may guard the paths of justice,<br>and preserve the way of his saints.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice,<br>equity and every good path.<br>
<sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter into your heart.<br>Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you.<br>Understanding will keep you,<br>
<sup>12</sup> to deliver you from the way of evil,<br>from the men who speak perverse things,<br>
<sup>13</sup> who forsake the paths of uprightness,<br>to walk in the ways of darkness,<br>
<sup>14</sup> who rejoice to do evil,<br>and delight in the perverseness of evil,<br>
<sup>15</sup> who are crooked in their ways,<br>and wayward in their paths,<br>
<sup>16</sup> to deliver you from the strange woman,<br>even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,<br>
<sup>17</sup> who forsakes the friend of her youth,<br>and forgets the covenant of her God;<br>
<sup>18</sup> for her house leads down to death,<br>her paths to the departed spirits.<br>
<sup>19</sup> None who go to her return again,<br>neither do they attain to the paths of life.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Therefore walk in the way of good men,<br>and keep the paths of the righteous.<br>
<sup>21</sup> For the upright will dwell in the land.<br>The perfect will remain in it.<br>
<sup>22</sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land.<br>The treacherous will be rooted out of it.

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).

## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, don’t forget my teaching,<br>but let your heart keep my commandments,<br>
<sup>2</sup> for they will add to you length of days,<br>years of life, and peace.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.<br>Bind them around your neck.<br>Write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
<sup>4</sup> So you will find favor,<br>and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,<br>and don’t lean on your own understanding.<br>
<sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge him,<br>and he will make your paths straight.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t be wise in your own eyes.<br>Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.<br>
<sup>8</sup> It will be health to your body,<br>and nourishment to your bones.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Honor Yahweh with your substance,<br>with the first fruits of all your increase;<br>
<sup>10</sup> so your barns will be filled with plenty,<br>and your vats will overflow with new wine.<br>
<sup>11</sup> My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline,<br>neither be weary of his correction;<br>
<sup>12</sup> for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects,<br>even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who finds wisdom,<br>the man who gets understanding.<br>
<sup>14</sup> For her good profit is better than getting silver,<br>and her return is better than fine gold.<br>
<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies.<br>None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand.<br>In her left hand are riches and honor.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness.<br>All her paths are peace.<br>
<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.<br>Happy is everyone who retains her.<br>
<sup>19</sup> By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.<br>By understanding, he established the heavens.<br>
<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,<br>and the skies drop down the dew.<br>
<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes.<br>Keep sound wisdom and discretion,<br>
<sup>22</sup> so they will be life to your soul,<br>and grace for your neck.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Then you shall walk in your way securely.<br>Your foot won’t stumble.<br>
<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid.<br>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,<br>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;<br>
<sup>26</sup> for Yahweh will be your confidence,<br>and will keep your foot from being taken.

<sup>27</sup> Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,<br>when it is in the power of your hand to do it.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;<br>tomorrow I will give it to you,”<br>when you have it by you.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,<br>since he dwells securely by you.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t strive with a man without cause,<br>if he has done you no harm.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t envy the man of violence.<br>Choose none of his ways.<br>
<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,<br>but his friendship is with the upright.<br>
<sup>33</sup> Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked,<br>but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Surely he mocks the mockers,<br>but he gives grace to the humble.<br>
<sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit glory,<br>but shame will be the promotion of fools.
## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.<br>Pay attention and know understanding;<br>
<sup>2</sup> for I give you sound learning.<br>Don’t forsake my law.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father,<br>tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He taught me, and said to me:<br>“Let your heart retain my words.<br>Keep my commandments, and live.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom.<br>Get understanding.<br>Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.<br>Love her, and she will keep you.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme.<br>Get wisdom.<br>Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Esteem her, and she will exalt you.<br>She will bring you to honor when you embrace her.<br>
<sup>9</sup> She will give to your head a garland of grace.<br>She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”

<sup>10</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.<br>The years of your life will be many.<br>
<sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom.<br>I have led you in straight paths.<br>
<sup>12</sup> When you go, your steps will not be hampered.<br>When you run, you will not stumble.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Take firm hold of instruction.<br>Don’t let her go.<br>Keep her, for she is your life.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t enter into the path of the wicked.<br>Don’t walk in the way of evil men.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.<br>Turn from it, and pass on.<br>
<sup>16</sup> For they don’t sleep unless they do evil.<br>Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.<br>
<sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness<br>and drink the wine of violence.<br>
<sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light<br>that shines more and more until the perfect day.<br>
<sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is like darkness.<br>They don’t know what they stumble over.

<sup>20</sup> My son, attend to my words.<br>Turn your ear to my sayings.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from your eyes.<br>Keep them in the center of your heart.<br>
<sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them,<br>and health to their whole body.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Keep your heart with all diligence,<br>for out of it is the wellspring of life.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.<br>Put corrupt lips far from you.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look straight ahead.<br>Fix your gaze directly before you.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Make the path of your feet level.<br>Let all of your ways be established.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left.<br>Remove your foot from evil.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom.<br>Turn your ear to my understanding,<br>
<sup>2</sup> that you may maintain discretion,<br>that your lips may preserve knowledge.<br>
<sup>3</sup> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.<br>Her mouth is smoother than oil,<br>
<sup>4</sup> but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,<br>and as sharp as a two-edged sword.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death.<br>Her steps lead straight to Sheol.<sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>6</sup> She gives no thought to the way of life.<br>Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.

<sup>7</sup> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.<br>Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Remove your way far from her.<br>Don’t come near the door of her house,<br>
<sup>9</sup> lest you give your honor to others,<br>and your years to the cruel one;<br>
<sup>10</sup> lest strangers feast on your wealth,<br>and your labors enrich another man’s house.<br>
<sup>11</sup> You will groan at your latter end,<br>when your flesh and your body are consumed,<br>
<sup>12</sup> and say, “How I have hated instruction,<br>and my heart despised reproof.<br>
<sup>13</sup> I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers,<br>nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!<br>
<sup>14</sup> I have come to the brink of utter ruin,<br>among the gathered assembly.”

<sup>15</sup> Drink water out of your own cistern,<br>running water out of your own well.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Should your springs overflow in the streets,<br>streams of water in the public squares?<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be for yourself alone,<br>not for strangers with you.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Let your spring be blessed.<br>Rejoice in the wife of your youth.<br>
<sup>19</sup> A loving doe and a graceful deer—<br>let her breasts satisfy you at all times.<br>Be captivated always with her love.<br>
<sup>20</sup> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?<br>Why embrace the bosom of another?<br>
<sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes.<br>He examines all his paths.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.<br>The cords of his sin hold him firmly.<br>
<sup>23</sup> He will die for lack of instruction.<br>In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,<br>if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,<br>
<sup>2</sup> you are trapped by the words of your mouth;<br>you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,<br>since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.<br>Go, humble yourself.<br>Press your plea with your neighbor.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes,<br>nor slumber to your eyelids.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,<br>like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard.<br>Consider her ways, and be wise;<br>
<sup>7</sup> which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,<br>
<sup>8</sup> provides her bread in the summer,<br>and gathers her food in the harvest.<br>
<sup>9</sup> How long will you sleep, sluggard?<br>When will you arise out of your sleep?<br>
<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber,<br>a little folding of the hands to sleep—<br>
<sup>11</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber,<br>and your scarcity as an armed man.

<sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity,<br>is he who walks with a perverse mouth,<br>
<sup>13</sup> who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,<br>who motions with his fingers,<br>
<sup>14</sup> in whose heart is perverseness,<br>who devises evil continually,<br>who always sows discord.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.<br>He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.

<sup>16</sup> There are six things which Yahweh hates;<br>yes, seven which are an abomination to him:<br>
<sup>17</sup> arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,<br>hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
<sup>18</sup> a heart that devises wicked schemes,<br>feet that are swift in running to mischief,<br>
<sup>19</sup> a false witness who utters lies,<br>and he who sows discord among brothers.

<sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father’s commandment,<br>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Bind them continually on your heart.<br>Tie them around your neck.<br>
<sup>22</sup> When you walk, it will lead you.<br>When you sleep, it will watch over you.<br>When you awake, it will talk with you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp,<br>and the law is light.<br>Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<br>
<sup>24</sup> to keep you from the immoral woman,<br>from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,<br>neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.<br>
<sup>26</sup> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.<br>The adulteress hunts for your precious life.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Can a man scoop fire into his lap,<br>and his clothes not be burned?<br>
<sup>28</sup> Or can one walk on hot coals,<br>and his feet not be scorched?<br>
<sup>29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.<br>Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Men don’t despise a thief<br>if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry,<br>
<sup>31</sup> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.<br>He shall give all the wealth of his house.<br>
<sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.<br>He who does it destroys his own soul.<br>
<sup>33</sup> He will get wounds and dishonor.<br>His reproach will not be wiped away.<br>
<sup>34</sup> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.<br>He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.<br>
<sup>35</sup> He won’t regard any ransom,<br>neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words.<br>Lay up my commandments within you.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live!<br>Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers.<br>Write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”<br>Call understanding your relative,<br>
<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the strange woman,<br>from the foreigner who flatters with her words.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house,<br>I looked out through my lattice.<br>
<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple ones.<br>I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,<br>
<sup>8</sup> passing through the street near her corner,<br>he went the way to her house,<br>
<sup>9</sup> in the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br>in the middle of the night and in the darkness.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,<br>and with crafty intent.<br>
<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant.<br>Her feet don’t stay in her house.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,<br>and lurking at every corner.<br>
<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him.<br>With an impudent face she said to him:<br>
<sup>14</sup> “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.<br>Today I have paid my vows.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore I came out to meet you,<br>to diligently seek your face,<br>and I have found you.<br>
<sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,<br>with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.<br>Let’s solace ourselves with loving.<br>
<sup>19</sup> For my husband isn’t at home.<br>He has gone on a long journey.<br>
<sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him.<br>He will come home at the full moon.”<br>
<sup>21</sup> With persuasive words, she led him astray.<br>With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.<br>
<sup>22</sup> He followed her immediately,<br>as an ox goes to the slaughter,<br>as a fool stepping into a noose.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Until an arrow strikes through his liver,<br>as a bird hurries to the snare,<br>and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.

<sup>24</sup> Now therefore, sons, listen to me.<br>Pay attention to the words of my mouth.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.<br>Don’t go astray in her paths,<br>
<sup>26</sup> for she has thrown down many wounded.<br>Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol,<sup>a</sup><br>going down to the rooms of death.

> - <sup>a</sup> 27. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doesn’t wisdom cry out?<br>Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?<br>
<sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way,<br>where the paths meet, she stands.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br>at the entry doors, she cries aloud:<br>
<sup>4</sup> “I call to you men!<br>I send my voice to the sons of mankind.<br>
<sup>5</sup> You simple, understand prudence!<br>You fools, be of an understanding heart!<br>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things.<br>The opening of my lips is for right things.<br>
<sup>7</sup> For my mouth speaks truth.<br>Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.<br>
<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.<br>There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.<br>
<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him who understands,<br>right to those who find knowledge.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction rather than silver,<br>knowledge rather than choice gold.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies.<br>All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.

<sup>12</sup> “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.<br>Find out knowledge and discretion.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.<br>I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.<br>I have understanding and power.<br>
<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign,<br>and princes decree justice.<br>
<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule,<br>nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I love those who love me.<br>Those who seek me diligently will find me.<br>
<sup>18</sup> With me are riches, honor,<br>enduring wealth, and prosperity.<br>
<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,<br>my yield than choice silver.<br>
<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness,<br>in the middle of the paths of justice,<br>
<sup>21</sup> that I may give wealth to those who love me.<br>I fill their treasuries.

<sup>22</sup> “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work,<br>before his deeds of old.<br>
<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<br>before the earth existed.<br>
<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was born,<br>when there were no springs abounding with water.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled in place,<br>before the hills, I was born;<br>
<sup>26</sup> while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<br>nor the beginning of the dust of the world.<br>
<sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there.<br>When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,<br>
<sup>28</sup> when he established the clouds above,<br>when the springs of the deep became strong,<br>
<sup>29</sup> when he gave to the sea its boundary,<br>that the waters should not violate his commandment,<br>when he marked out the foundations of the earth,<br>
<sup>30</sup> then I was the craftsman by his side.<br>I was a delight day by day,<br>always rejoicing before him,<br>
<sup>31</sup> rejoicing in his whole world.<br>My delight was with the sons of men.

<sup>32</sup> “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,<br>for blessed are those who keep my ways.<br>
<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise.<br>Don’t refuse it.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who hears me,<br>watching daily at my gates,<br>waiting at my door posts.<br>
<sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me finds life,<br>and will obtain favor from Yahweh.<br>
<sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.<br>All those who hate me love death.”
## Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house.<br>She has carved out her seven pillars.<br>
<sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat.<br>She has mixed her wine.<br>She has also set her table.<br>
<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidens.<br>She cries from the highest places of the city:<br>
<sup>4</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”<br>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,<br>
<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat some of my bread,<br>Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!<br>
<sup>6</sup> Leave your simple ways, and live.<br>Walk in the way of understanding.”

<sup>7</sup> One who corrects a mocker invites insult.<br>One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.<br>Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser.<br>Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.<br>The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.<br>
<sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be multiplied.<br>The years of your life will be increased.<br>
<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.<br>If you mock, you alone will bear it.

<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is loud,<br>undisciplined, and knows nothing.<br>
<sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house,<br>on a seat in the high places of the city,<br>
<sup>15</sup> to call to those who pass by,<br>who go straight on their ways,<br>
<sup>16</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”<br>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,<br>
<sup>17</sup> “Stolen water is sweet.<br>Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”<br>
<sup>18</sup> But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,<br>that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.<sup>a</sup>

> - <sup>a</sup> 18. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon.<br>A wise son makes a glad father;<br>but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,<br>but righteousness delivers from death.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,<br>but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.<br>
<sup>4</sup> He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand,<br>but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He who gathers in summer is a wise son,<br>but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Blessings are on the head of the righteous,<br>but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The memory of the righteous is blessed,<br>but the name of the wicked will rot.<br>
<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart accept commandments,<br>but a chattering fool will fall.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He who walks blamelessly walks surely,<br>but he who perverts his ways will be found out.<br>
<sup>10</sup> One who winks with the eye causes sorrow,<br>but a chattering fool will fall.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life,<br>but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Hatred stirs up strife,<br>but love covers all wrongs.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,<br>but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.<br>

<sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh;<br>he will reward him.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for there is hope;<br>don’t be a willing party to his death.<br>
<sup>19</sup> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,<br>for if you rescue him, you must do it again.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and receive instruction,<br>that you may be wise in your latter end.<br>
<sup>21</sup> There are many plans in a man’s heart,<br>but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail.<br>
<sup>22</sup> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.<br>A poor man is better than a liar.<br>
<sup>23</sup> The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment;<br>he rests and will not be touched by trouble.<br>
<sup>24</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;<br>he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;<br>rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.<br>
<sup>26</sup> He who robs his father and drives away his mother<br>is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.<br>
<sup>27</sup> If you stop listening to instruction, my son,<br>you will stray from the words of knowledge.<br>
<sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice,<br>and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Penalties are prepared for scoffers,<br>and beatings for the backs of fools.
## Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler.<br>Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.<br>He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.<br>
<sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,<br>but every fool will be quarreling.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;<br>therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,<br>but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,<br>but who can find a faithful man?<br>
<sup>7</sup> A righteous man walks in integrity.<br>Blessed are his children after him.<br>
<sup>8</sup> A king who sits on the throne of judgment<br>scatters away all evil with his eyes.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.<br>I am clean and without sin”?<br>
<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures,<br>both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Even a child makes himself known by his doings,<br>whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,<br>Yahweh has made even both of them.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.<br>Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.<br>
<sup>14</sup> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;<br>but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.<br>
<sup>15</sup> There is gold and abundance of rubies,<br>but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;<br>and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,<br>but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Plans are established by advice;<br>by wise guidance you wage war!<br>
<sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;<br>therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or his mother,<br>his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.<br>
<sup>21</sup> An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning<br>won’t be blessed in the end.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.”<br>Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Yahweh detests differing weights,<br>and dishonest scales are not pleasing.<br>
<sup>24</sup> A man’s steps are from Yahweh;<br>how then can man understand his way?<br>
<sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication,<br>then later to consider his vows.<br>
<sup>26</sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked,<br>and drives the threshing wheel over them.<br>
<sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp,<br>searching all his innermost parts.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.<br>His throne is sustained by love.<br>
<sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength.<br>The splendor of old men is their gray hair.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Wounding blows cleanse away evil,<br>and beatings purge the innermost parts.
## Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses.<br>He turns it wherever he desires.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<br>but Yahweh weighs the hearts.<br>
<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice<br>is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.<br>
<sup>4</sup> A high look and a proud heart,<br>the lamp of the wicked, is sin.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;<br>and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Getting treasures by a lying tongue<br>is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will drive them away,<br>because they refuse to do what is right.<br>
<sup>8</sup> The way of the guilty is devious,<br>but the conduct of the innocent is upright.<br>
<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br>than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desires evil;<br>his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.<br>
<sup>11</sup> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.<br>When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.<br>
<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,<br>and brings the wicked to ruin.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,<br>he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.<br>
<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifies anger,<br>and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.<br>
<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice;<br>but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.<br>
<sup>16</sup> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding<br>shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.<br>
<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure will be a poor man.<br>He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.<br>
<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,<br>the treacherous for the upright.<br>
<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land,<br>than with a contentious and fretful woman.<br>
<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise,<br>but a foolish man swallows it up.<br>
<sup>21</sup> He who follows after righteousness and kindness<br>finds life, righteousness, and honor.<br>
<sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty,<br>and brings down the strength of its confidence.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue<br>keeps his soul from troubles.<br>
<sup>24</sup> The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name—<br>he works in the arrogance of pride.<br>
<sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard kills him,<br>for his hands refuse to labor.<br>
<sup>26</sup> There are those who covet greedily all day long;<br>but the righteous give and don’t withhold.<br>
<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—<br>how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!<br>
<sup>28</sup> A false witness will perish.<br>A man who listens speaks to eternity.<br>
<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face;<br>but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.<br>
<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding<br>nor counsel against Yahweh.<br>
<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared for the day of battle;<br>but victory is with Yahweh.
## Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches,<br>and loving favor is better than silver and gold.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common:<br>Yahweh is the maker of them all.<br>
<sup>3</sup> A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;<br>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh<br>is wealth, honor, and life.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked;<br>whoever guards his soul stays from them.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go,<br>and when he is old he will not depart from it.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The rich rule over the poor.<br>The borrower is servant to the lender.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,<br>and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He who has a generous eye will be blessed,<br>for he shares his food with the poor.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;<br>yes, quarrels and insults will stop.<br>
<sup>11</sup> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully<br>is the king’s friend.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge,<br>but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!<br>I will be killed in the streets!”<br>
<sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.<br>He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child;<br>the rod of discipline drives it far from him.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,<br>both come to poverty.

<sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.<br>Apply your heart to my teaching.<br>
<sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,<br>if all of them are ready on your lips.<br>
<sup>19</sup> I teach you today, even you,<br>so that your trust may be in Yahweh.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things<br>of counsel and knowledge,<br>
<sup>21</sup> To teach you truth, reliable words,<br>to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?

<sup>22</sup> Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor;<br>and don’t crush the needy in court;<br>
<sup>23</sup> for Yahweh will plead their case,<br>and plunder the life of those who plunder them.

<sup>24</sup> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man.<br>Don’t associate with one who harbors anger,<br>
<sup>25</sup> lest you learn his ways<br>and ensnare your soul.

<sup>26</sup> Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,<br>of those who are collateral for debts.<br>
<sup>27</sup> If you don’t have means to pay,<br>why should he take away your bed from under you?

<sup>28</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone<br>which your fathers have set up.

<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work?<br>He will serve kings.<br>He won’t serve obscure men.
## Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When you sit to eat with a ruler,<br>consider diligently what is before you;<br>
<sup>2</sup> put a knife to your throat<br>if you are a man given to appetite.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t be desirous of his dainties,<br>since they are deceitful food.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t weary yourself to be rich.<br>In your wisdom, show restraint.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?<br>For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,<br>and don’t crave his delicacies,<br>
<sup>7</sup> for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.<br>“Eat and drink!” he says to you,<br>but his heart is not with you.<br>
<sup>8</sup> You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten<br>and waste your pleasant words.

<sup>9</sup> Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,<br>for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

<sup>10</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.<br>Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,<br>
<sup>11</sup> for their Defender is strong.<br>He will plead their case against you.

<sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction,<br>and your ears to the words of knowledge.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t withhold correction from a child.<br>If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Punish him with the rod,<br>and save his soul from Sheol.<sup>a</sup>

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise,<br>then my heart will be glad, even mine.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Yes, my heart will rejoice<br>when your lips speak what is right.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t let your heart envy sinners,<br>but rather fear Yahweh all day long.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Indeed surely there is a future hope,<br>and your hope will not be cut off.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise,<br>and keep your heart on the right path!<br>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine,<br>or those who gorge themselves on meat;<br>
<sup>21</sup> for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;<br>and drowsiness clothes them in rags.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life,<br>and don’t despise your mother when she is old.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.<br>Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.<br>
<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous has great joy.<br>Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad!<br>Let her who bore you rejoice!<br>
<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart;<br>and let your eyes keep in my ways.<br>
<sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit;<br>and a wayward wife is a narrow well.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,<br>and increases the unfaithful among men.

<sup>29</sup> Who has woe?<br>Who has sorrow?<br>Who has strife?<br>Who has complaints?<br>Who has needless bruises?<br>Who has bloodshot eyes?<br>
<sup>30</sup> Those who stay long at the wine;<br>those who go to seek out mixed wine.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t look at the wine when it is red,<br>when it sparkles in the cup,<br>when it goes down smoothly.<br>
<sup>32</sup> In the end, it bites like a snake,<br>and poisons like a viper.<br>
<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things,<br>and your mind will imagine confusing things.<br>
<sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea,<br>or as he who lies on top of the rigging:<br>
<sup>35</sup> “They hit me, and I was not hurt!<br>They beat me, and I don’t feel it!<br>When will I wake up? I can do it again.<br>I will look for more.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 14. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Don’t be envious of evil men,<br>neither desire to be with them;<br>
<sup>2</sup> for their hearts plot violence<br>and their lips talk about mischief.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Through wisdom a house is built;<br>by understanding it is established;<br>
<sup>4</sup> by knowledge the rooms are filled<br>with all rare and beautiful treasure.<br>
<sup>5</sup> A wise man has great power.<br>A knowledgeable man increases strength,<br>
<sup>6</sup> for by wise guidance you wage your war,<br>and victory is in many advisors.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool.<br>He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.<br>
<sup>8</sup> One who plots to do evil<br>will be called a schemer.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The schemes of folly are sin.<br>The mocker is detested by men.<br>
<sup>10</sup> If you falter in the time of trouble,<br>your strength is small.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Rescue those who are being led away to death!<br>Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!<br>
<sup>12</sup> If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”<br>doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?<br>He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?<br>Shall he not render to every man according to his work?<br>
<sup>13</sup> My son, eat honey, for it is good,<br>the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;<br>
<sup>14</sup> so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.<br>If you have found it, then there will be a reward:<br>Your hope will not be cut off.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.<br>Don’t destroy his resting place;<br>
<sup>16</sup> for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again,<br>but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.<br>Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,<br>
<sup>18</sup> lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him,<br>and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,<br>neither be envious of the wicked;<br>
<sup>20</sup> for there will be no reward to the evil man.<br>The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.<br>
<sup>21</sup> My son, fear Yahweh and the king.<br>Don’t join those who are rebellious,<br>
<sup>22</sup> for their calamity will rise suddenly.<br>Who knows what destruction may come from them both?

<sup>23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.<br>
<sup>24</sup> He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”<br>peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him—<br>
<sup>25</sup> but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,<br>and a rich blessing will come on them.<br>
<sup>26</sup> An honest answer<br>is like a kiss on the lips.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Prepare your work outside,<br>and get your fields ready.<br>Afterwards, build your house.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.<br>Don’t deceive with your lips.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;<br>I will repay the man according to his work.”<br>
<sup>30</sup> I went by the field of the sluggard,<br>by the vineyard of the man void of understanding.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.<br>Its surface was covered with nettles,<br>and its stone wall was broken down.<br>
<sup>32</sup> Then I saw, and considered well.<br>I saw, and received instruction:<br>
<sup>33</sup> a little sleep, a little slumber,<br>a little folding of the hands to sleep,<br>
<sup>34</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber<br>and your want as an armed man.
## Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.<br>
<sup>2</sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,<br>but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.<br>
<sup>3</sup> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,<br>so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver,<br>and material comes out for the refiner.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,<br>and his throne will be established in righteousness.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br>or claim a place among great men;<br>
<sup>7</sup> for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”<br>than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,<br>whom your eyes have seen.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.<br>What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?<br>
<sup>9</sup> Debate your case with your neighbor,<br>and don’t betray the confidence of another,<br>
<sup>10</sup> lest one who hears it put you to shame,<br>and your bad reputation never depart.

<sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken<br>is like apples of gold in settings of silver.<br>
<sup>12</sup> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br>so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.<br>
<sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<br>so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;<br>for he refreshes the soul of his masters.<br>
<sup>14</sup> As clouds and wind without rain,<br>so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.<br>
<sup>15</sup> By patience a ruler is persuaded.<br>A soft tongue breaks the bone.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Have you found honey?<br>Eat as much as is sufficient for you,<br>lest you eat too much, and vomit it.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,<br>lest he be weary of you, and hate you.<br>
<sup>18</sup> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor<br>is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble<br>is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.<br>
<sup>20</sup> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,<br>or vinegar on soda,<br>so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.<br>
<sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.<br>If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;<br>
<sup>22</sup> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br>and Yahweh will reward you.<br>
<sup>23</sup> The north wind produces rain;<br>so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.<br>
<sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br>than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Like cold water to a thirsty soul,<br>so is good news from a far country.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,<br>so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.<br>
<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey,<br>nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Like a city that is broken down and without walls<br>is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
## Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,<br>so honor is not fitting for a fool.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Like a fluttering sparrow,<br>like a darting swallow,<br>so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.<br>
<sup>3</sup> A whip is for the horse,<br>a bridle for the donkey,<br>and a rod for the back of fools!<br>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,<br>lest you also be like him.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly,<br>lest he be wise in his own eyes.<br>
<sup>6</sup> One who sends a message by the hand of a fool<br>is cutting off feet and drinking violence.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,<br>so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br>
<sup>8</sup> As one who binds a stone in a sling,<br>so is he who gives honor to a fool.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,<br>so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br>
<sup>10</sup> As an archer who wounds all,<br>so is he who hires a fool<br>or he who hires those who pass by.<br>
<sup>11</sup> As a dog that returns to his vomit,<br>so is a fool who repeats his folly.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?<br>There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!<br>A fierce lion roams the streets!”<br>
<sup>14</sup> As the door turns on its hinges,<br>so does the sluggard on his bed.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.<br>He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.<br>
<sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes<br>than seven men who answer with discretion.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Like one who grabs a dog’s ears<br>is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,<br>
<sup>19</sup> is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”<br>
<sup>20</sup> For lack of wood a fire goes out.<br>Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.<br>
<sup>21</sup> As coals are to hot embers,<br>and wood to fire,<br>so is a contentious man to kindling strife.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,<br>they go down into the innermost parts.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel<br>are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.<br>
<sup>24</sup> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,<br>but he harbors evil in his heart.<br>
<sup>25</sup> When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,<br>for there are seven abominations in his heart.<br>
<sup>26</sup> His malice may be concealed by deception,<br>but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.<br>
<sup>27</sup> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.<br>Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.<br>
<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates those it hurts;<br>and a flattering mouth works ruin.
## Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Don’t boast about tomorrow;<br>for you don’t know what a day may bring.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you,<br>and not your own mouth;<br>a stranger, and not your own lips.<br>
<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy,<br>and sand is a burden;<br>but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel,<br>and anger is overwhelming;<br>but who is able to stand before jealousy?<br>
<sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke<br>than hidden love.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are faithful,<br>although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.<br>
<sup>7</sup> A full soul loathes a honeycomb;<br>but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.<br>
<sup>8</sup> As a bird that wanders from her nest,<br>so is a man who wanders from his home.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;<br>so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.<br>Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.<br>A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son,<br>and bring joy to my heart,<br>then I can answer my tormentor.<br>
<sup>12</sup> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;<br>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.<br>Hold it for a wayward woman!<br>
<sup>14</sup> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,<br>it will be taken as a curse by him.<br>
<sup>15</sup> A continual dropping on a rainy day<br>and a contentious wife are alike:<br>
<sup>16</sup> restraining her is like restraining the wind,<br>or like grasping oil in his right hand.

<sup>17</sup> Iron sharpens iron;<br>so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.<br>He who looks after his master shall be honored.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Like water reflects a face,<br>so a man’s heart reflects the man.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Sheol<sup>a</sup> and Abaddon are never satisfied;<br>and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.<br>
<sup>21</sup> The crucible is for silver,<br>and the furnace for gold;<br>but man is refined by his praise.<br>
<sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,<br>yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.

<sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks,<br>and pay attention to your herds,<br>
<sup>24</sup> for riches are not forever,<br>nor does the crown endure to all generations.<br>
<sup>25</sup> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,<br>the grasses of the hills are gathered in.<br>
<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing,<br>and the goats are the price of a field.<br>
<sup>27</sup> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,<br>for your family’s food,<br>and for the nourishment of your servant girls.

> - <sup>a</sup> 20. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues;<br>but the righteous are as bold as a lion.<br>
<sup>2</sup> In rebellion, a land has many rulers,<br>but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.<br>
<sup>3</sup> A needy man who oppresses the poor<br>is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;<br>but those who keep the law contend with them.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Evil men don’t understand justice;<br>but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br>than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;<br>but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.<br>
<sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest<br>gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br>even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,<br>he will fall into his own trap;<br>but the blameless will inherit good.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own eyes;<br>but the poor who has understanding sees through him.<br>
<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;<br>but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<br>
<sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,<br>but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears;<br>but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.<br>
<sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion or a charging bear,<br>so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.<br>
<sup>16</sup> A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.<br>One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.<br>
<sup>17</sup> A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death.<br>No one will support him.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;<br>but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.<br>
<sup>19</sup> One who works his land will have an abundance of food;<br>but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.<br>
<sup>20</sup> A faithful man is rich with blessings;<br>but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.<br>
<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good,<br>yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.<br>
<sup>22</sup> A stingy man hurries after riches,<br>and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.<br>
<sup>23</sup> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor<br>than one who flatters with the tongue.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,”<br>is a partner with a destroyer.<br>
<sup>25</sup> One who is greedy stirs up strife;<br>but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.<br>
<sup>26</sup> One who trusts in himself is a fool;<br>but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.<br>
<sup>27</sup> One who gives to the poor has no lack;<br>but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.<br>
<sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;<br>but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
## Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck<br>will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.<br>
<sup>2</sup> When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;<br>but when the wicked rule, the people groan.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;<br>but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.<br>
<sup>4</sup> The king by justice makes the land stable,<br>but he who takes bribes tears it down.<br>
<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor<br>spreads a net for his feet.<br>
<sup>6</sup> An evil man is snared by his sin,<br>but the righteous can sing and be glad.<br>
<sup>7</sup> The righteous care about justice for the poor.<br>The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Mockers stir up a city,<br>but wise men turn away anger.<br>
<sup>9</sup> If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,<br>the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;<br>and they seek the life of the upright.<br>
<sup>11</sup> A fool vents all of his anger,<br>but a wise man brings himself under control.<br>
<sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lies,<br>all of his officials are wicked.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:<br>Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The king who fairly judges the poor,<br>his throne shall be established forever.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The rod of correction gives wisdom,<br>but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.<br>
<sup>16</sup> When the wicked increase, sin increases;<br>but the righteous will see their downfall.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Correct your son, and he will give you peace;<br>yes, he will bring delight to your soul.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;<br>but one who keeps the law is blessed.<br>
<sup>19</sup> A servant can’t be corrected by words.<br>Though he understands, yet he will not respond.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?<br>There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
<sup>21</sup> He who pampers his servant from youth<br>will have him become a son in the end.<br>
<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up strife,<br>and a wrathful man abounds in sin.<br>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride brings him low,<br>but one of lowly spirit gains honor.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.<br>He takes an oath, but dares not testify.<br>
<sup>25</sup> The fear of man proves to be a snare,<br>but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor,<br>but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh.<br>
<sup>27</sup> A dishonest man detests the righteous,<br>and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
## Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation:<br>the man says to Ithiel,<br>to Ithiel and Ucal:<br>
<sup>2</sup> “Surely I am the most ignorant man,<br>and don’t have a man’s understanding.<br>
<sup>3</sup> I have not learned wisdom,<br>neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?<br>Who has gathered the wind in his fists?<br>Who has bound the waters in his garment?<br>Who has established all the ends of the earth?<br>What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?

<sup>5</sup> “Every word of God is flawless.<br>He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t you add to his words,<br>lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.

<sup>7</sup> “Two things I have asked of you.<br>Don’t deny me before I die.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Remove far from me falsehood and lies.<br>Give me neither poverty nor riches.<br>Feed me with the food that is needful for me,<br>
<sup>9</sup> lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Yahweh?’<br>or lest I be poor, and steal,<br>and so dishonor the name of my God.

<sup>10</sup> “Don’t slander a servant to his master,<br>lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.

<sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curses their father,<br>and doesn’t bless their mother.<br>
<sup>12</sup> There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,<br>yet are not washed from their filthiness.<br>
<sup>13</sup> There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!<br>Their eyelids are lifted up.<br>
<sup>14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,<br>and their jaws like knives,<br>to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.

<sup>15</sup> “The leech has two daughters:<br>‘Give, give.’ “There are three things that are never satisfied;<br>four that don’t say, ‘Enough!’:<br>
<sup>16</sup> Sheol,<sup>a</sup><br>the barren womb,<br>the earth that is not satisfied with water,<br>and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough!’

<sup>17</sup> “The eye that mocks at his father,<br>and scorns obedience to his mother,<br>the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,<br>the young eagles shall eat it.

<sup>18</sup> “There are three things which are too amazing for me,<br>four which I don’t understand:<br>
<sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air,<br>the way of a serpent on a rock,<br>the way of a ship in the middle of the sea,<br>and the way of a man with a maiden.

<sup>20</sup> “So is the way of an adulterous woman:<br>She eats and wipes her mouth,<br>and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’

<sup>21</sup> “For three things the earth trembles,<br>and under four, it can’t bear up:<br>
<sup>22</sup> For a servant when he is king,<br>a fool when he is filled with food,<br>
<sup>23</sup> for an unloved woman when she is married,<br>and a servant who is heir to her mistress.

<sup>24</sup> “There are four things which are little on the earth,<br>but they are exceedingly wise:<br>
<sup>25</sup> The ants are not a strong people,<br>yet they provide their food in the summer.<br>
<sup>26</sup> The hyraxes are but a feeble folk,<br>yet make they their houses in the rocks.<br>
<sup>27</sup> The locusts have no king,<br>yet they advance in ranks.<br>
<sup>28</sup> You can catch a lizard with your hands,<br>yet it is in kings’ palaces.

<sup>29</sup> “There are three things which are stately in their march,<br>four which are stately in going:<br>
<sup>30</sup> The lion, which is mightiest among animals,<br>and doesn’t turn away for any;<br>
<sup>31</sup> the greyhound;<br>the male goat;<br>and the king against whom there is no rising up.

<sup>32</sup> “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,<br>or if you have thought evil,<br>put your hand over your mouth.<br>
<sup>33</sup> For as the churning of milk produces butter,<br>and the wringing of the nose produces blood,<br>so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 16. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:

<sup>2</sup> “Oh, my son!<br>Oh, son of my womb!<br>Oh, son of my vows!<br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t give your strength to women,<br>nor your ways to that which destroys kings.<br>
<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, Lemuel,<br>it is not for kings to drink wine,<br>nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’<br>
<sup>5</sup> lest they drink, and forget the law,<br>and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,<br>and wine to the bitter in soul.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty,<br>and remember his misery no more.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the mute,<br>in the cause of all who are left desolate.<br>
<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously,<br>and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

<sup>10</sup> Who can find a worthy woman?<br>For her value is far above rubies.<br>
<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her.<br>He shall have no lack of gain.<br>
<sup>12</sup> She does him good, and not harm,<br>all the days of her life.<br>
<sup>13</sup> She seeks wool and flax,<br>and works eagerly with her hands.<br>
<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships.<br>She brings her bread from afar.<br>
<sup>15</sup> She rises also while it is yet night,<br>gives food to her household,<br>and portions for her servant girls.<br>
<sup>16</sup> She considers a field, and buys it.<br>With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.<br>
<sup>17</sup> She arms her waist with strength,<br>and makes her arms strong.<br>
<sup>18</sup> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.<br>Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.<br>
<sup>19</sup> She lays her hands to the distaff,<br>and her hands hold the spindle.<br>
<sup>20</sup> She opens her arms to the poor;<br>yes, she extends her hands to the needy.<br>
<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household,<br>for all her household are clothed with scarlet.<br>
<sup>22</sup> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.<br>Her clothing is fine linen and purple.<br>
<sup>23</sup> Her husband is respected in the gates,<br>when he sits among the elders of the land.<br>
<sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them,<br>and delivers sashes to the merchant.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing.<br>She laughs at the time to come.<br>
<sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom.<br>Kind instruction is on her tongue.<br>
<sup>27</sup> She looks well to the ways of her household,<br>and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed.<br>Her husband also praises her:<br>
<sup>29</sup> “Many women do noble things,<br>but you excel them all.”<br>
<sup>30</sup> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;<br>but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.<br>
<sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands!<br>Let her works praise her in the gates!
