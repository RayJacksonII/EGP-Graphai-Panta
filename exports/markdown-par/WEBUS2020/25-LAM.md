## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> How the city sits solitary,<br>that was full of people!<br>She has become as a widow,<br>who was great among the nations!<br>She who was a princess among the provinces<br>has become a slave!

<sup>2</sup> She weeps bitterly in the night.<br>Her tears are on her cheeks.<br>Among all her lovers<br>she has no one to comfort her.<br>All her friends have dealt treacherously with her.<br>They have become her enemies.

<sup>3</sup> Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction<br>and because of great servitude.<br>She dwells among the nations.<br>She finds no rest.<br>All her persecutors overtook her in her distress.

<sup>4</sup> The roads to Zion mourn,<br>because no one comes to the solemn assembly.<br>All her gates are desolate.<br>Her priests sigh.<br>Her virgins are afflicted,<br>and she herself is in bitterness.

<sup>5</sup> Her adversaries have become the head.<br>Her enemies prosper;<br>for Yahweh<sup>a</sup> has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions.<br>Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.

<sup>6</sup> All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.<br>Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture.<br>They have gone without strength before the pursuer.

<sup>7</sup> Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries<br>all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;<br>when her people fell into the hand of the adversary,<br>and no one helped her.<br>The adversaries saw her.<br>They mocked at her desolations.

<sup>8</sup> Jerusalem has grievously sinned.<br>Therefore she has become unclean.<br>All who honored her despise her,<br>because they have seen her nakedness.<br>Yes, she sighs and turns backward.

<sup>9</sup> Her filthiness was in her skirts.<br>She didn’t remember her latter end.<br>Therefore she has come down astoundingly.<br>She has no comforter.<br>“See, Yahweh, my affliction;<br>for the enemy has magnified himself.”

<sup>10</sup> The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things;<br>for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,<br>concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.

<sup>11</sup> All her people sigh.<br>They seek bread.<br>They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.<br>“Look, Yahweh, and see,<br>for I have become despised.”

<sup>12</sup> “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?<br>Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,<br>which is brought on me,<br>with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

<sup>13</sup> “From on high has he sent fire into my bones,<br>and it prevails against them.<br>He has spread a net for my feet.<br>He has turned me back.<br>He has made me desolate and I faint all day long.

<sup>14</sup> “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.<br>They are knit together.<br>They have come up on my neck.<br>He made my strength fail.<br>The Lord<sup>b</sup> has delivered me into their hands,<br>against whom I am not able to stand.

<sup>15</sup> “The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.<br>He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.<br>The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.

<sup>16</sup> “For these things I weep.<br>My eye, my eye runs down with water,<br>because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.<br>My children are desolate,<br>because the enemy has prevailed.”

<sup>17</sup> Zion spreads out her hands.<br>There is no one to comfort her.<br>Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob,<br>that those who are around him should be his adversaries.<br>Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.

<sup>18</sup> “Yahweh is righteous,<br>for I have rebelled against his commandment.<br>Please hear all you peoples,<br>and see my sorrow.<br>My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.

<sup>19</sup> “I called for my lovers,<br>but they deceived me.<br>My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,<br>while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.

<sup>20</sup> “Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress.<br>My heart is troubled.<br>My heart turns over within me,<br>for I have grievously rebelled.<br>Abroad, the sword bereaves.<br>At home, it is like death.

<sup>21</sup> “They have heard that I sigh.<br>There is no one to comfort me.<br>All my enemies have heard of my trouble.<br>They are glad that you have done it.<br>You will bring the day that you have proclaimed,<br>and they will be like me.

<sup>22</sup> “Let all their wickedness come before you.<br>Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions.<br>For my sighs are many,<br>and my heart is faint.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!<br>He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,<br>and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.

<sup>2</sup> The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob<br>without pity.<br>He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.<br>He has brought them down to the ground.<br>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.

<sup>3</sup> He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.<br>He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.<br>He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire,<br>which devours all around.

<sup>4</sup> He has bent his bow like an enemy.<br>He has stood with his right hand as an adversary.<br>He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye.<br>In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.

<sup>5</sup> The Lord has become as an enemy.<br>He has swallowed up Israel.<br>He has swallowed up all her palaces.<br>He has destroyed his strongholds.<br>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.

<sup>6</sup> He has violently taken away his tabernacle,<br>as if it were a garden.<br>He has destroyed his place of assembly.<br>Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion.<br>In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.

<sup>7</sup> The Lord has cast off his altar.<br>He has abhorred his sanctuary.<br>He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.<br>They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house,<br>as in the day of a solemn assembly.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.<br>He has stretched out the line.<br>He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;<br>He has made the rampart and wall lament.<br>They languish together.

<sup>9</sup> Her gates have sunk into the ground.<br>He has destroyed and broken her bars.<br>Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not.<br>Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.

<sup>10</sup> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.<br>They keep silence.<br>They have cast up dust on their heads.<br>They have clothed themselves with sackcloth.<br>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

<sup>11</sup> My eyes fail with tears.<br>My heart is troubled.<br>My bile is poured on the earth,<br>because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,<br>because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.

<sup>12</sup> They ask their mothers,<br>“Where is grain and wine?”<br>when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,<br>when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.

<sup>13</sup> What shall I testify to you?<br>What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?<br>What shall I compare to you,<br>that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?<br>For your breach is as big as the sea.<br>Who can heal you?

<sup>14</sup> Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.<br>They have not uncovered your iniquity,<br>to reverse your captivity,<br>but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.

<sup>15</sup> All that pass by clap their hands at you.<br>They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,<br>“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,<br>the joy of the whole earth’?”

<sup>16</sup> All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.<br>They hiss and gnash their teeth.<br>They say, “We have swallowed her up.<br>Certainly this is the day that we looked for.<br>We have found it.<br>We have seen it.”

<sup>17</sup> Yahweh has done that which he planned.<br>He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old.<br>He has thrown down,<br>and has not pitied.<br>He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.<br>He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.

<sup>18</sup> Their heart cried to the Lord.<br>O wall of the daughter of Zion,<br>let tears run down like a river day and night.<br>Give yourself no relief.<br>Don’t let your eyes rest.

<sup>19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night,<br>at the beginning of the watches!<br>Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.<br>Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,<br>who faint for hunger at the head of every street.

<sup>20</sup> “Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!<br>Should the women eat their offspring,<br>the children that they held and bounced on their knees?<br>Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?

<sup>21</sup> “The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.<br>My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.<br>You have killed them in the day of your anger.<br>You have slaughtered, and not pitied.

<sup>22</sup> “You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.<br>There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger.<br>My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction<br>by the rod of his wrath.<br>
<sup>2</sup> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,<br>and not in light.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Surely he turns his hand against me<br>again and again all day long.

<sup>4</sup> He has made my flesh and my skin old.<br>He has broken my bones.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He has built against me,<br>and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in dark places,<br>as those who have been long dead.

<sup>7</sup> He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.<br>He has made my chain heavy.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Yes, when I cry, and call for help,<br>he shuts out my prayer.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He has walled up my ways with cut stone.<br>He has made my paths crooked.

<sup>10</sup> He is to me as a bear lying in wait,<br>as a lion in hiding.<br>
<sup>11</sup> He has turned away my path,<br>and pulled me in pieces.<br>He has made me desolate.<br>
<sup>12</sup> He has bent his bow,<br>and set me as a mark for the arrow.

<sup>13</sup> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I have become a derision to all my people,<br>and their song all day long.<br>
<sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness.<br>He has stuffed me with wormwood.

<sup>16</sup> He has also broken my teeth with gravel.<br>He has covered me with ashes.<br>
<sup>17</sup> You have removed my soul far away from peace.<br>I forgot prosperity.<br>
<sup>18</sup> I said, “My strength has perished,<br>along with my expectation from Yahweh.”

<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my misery,<br>the wormwood and the bitterness.<br>
<sup>20</sup> My soul still remembers them,<br>and is bowed down within me.<br>
<sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind;<br>therefore I have hope.

<sup>22</sup> It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,<br>because his mercies don’t fail.<br>
<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning.<br>Great is your faithfulness.<br>
<sup>24</sup> “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.<br>“Therefore I will hope in him.”

<sup>25</sup> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,<br>to the soul who seeks him.<br>
<sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should hope<br>and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.<br>
<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence,<br>because he has laid it on him.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust,<br>if it is so that there may be hope.<br>
<sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.<br>Let him be filled full of reproach.

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off forever.<br>
<sup>32</sup> For though he causes grief,<br>yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<br>
<sup>33</sup> For he does not afflict willingly,<br>nor grieve the children of men.

<sup>34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,<br>
<sup>35</sup> to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,<br>
<sup>36</sup> to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.

<sup>37</sup> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,<br>when the Lord doesn’t command it?<br>
<sup>38</sup> Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?<br>
<sup>39</sup> Why should a living man complain,<br>a man for the punishment of his sins?

<sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways,<br>and turn again to Yahweh.<br>
<sup>41</sup> Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God<sup>a</sup> in the heavens.<br>
<sup>42</sup> “We have transgressed and have rebelled.<br>You have not pardoned.

<sup>43</sup> “You have covered us with anger and pursued us.<br>You have killed.<br>You have not pitied.<br>
<sup>44</sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud,<br>so that no prayer can pass through.<br>
<sup>45</sup> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse<br>in the middle of the peoples.

<sup>46</sup> “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.<br>
<sup>47</sup> Terror and the pit have come on us,<br>devastation and destruction.”

<sup>48</sup> My eye runs down with streams of water,<br>for the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
<sup>49</sup> My eye pours down<br>and doesn’t cease,<br>without any intermission,<br>
<sup>50</sup> until Yahweh looks down,<br>and sees from heaven.<br>
<sup>51</sup> My eye affects my soul,<br>because of all the daughters of my city.

<sup>52</sup> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird,<br>those who are my enemies without cause.<br>
<sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon,<br>and have cast a stone on me.<br>
<sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head.<br>I said, “I am cut off.”

<sup>55</sup> I called on your name, Yahweh,<br>out of the lowest dungeon.<br>
<sup>56</sup> You heard my voice:<br>“Don’t hide your ear from my sighing,<br>and my cry.”

<sup>57</sup> You came near in the day that I called on you.<br>You said, “Don’t be afraid.”

<sup>58</sup> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul.<br>You have redeemed my life.<br>
<sup>59</sup> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong.<br>Judge my cause.<br>
<sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance<br>and all their plans against me.

<sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh,<br>and all their plans against me,<br>
<sup>62</sup> the lips of those that rose up against me,<br>and their plots against me all day long.<br>
<sup>63</sup> You see their sitting down and their rising up.<br>I am their song.

<sup>64</sup> You will pay them back, Yahweh,<br>according to the work of their hands.<br>
<sup>65</sup> You will give them hardness of heart,<br>your curse to them.<br>
<sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger,<br>and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.

## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> How the gold has become dim!<br>The most pure gold has changed!<br>The stones of the sanctuary are poured out<br>at the head of every street.

<sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Zion,<br>comparable to fine gold,<br>how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,<br>the work of the hands of the potter!

<sup>3</sup> Even the jackals offer their breast.<br>They nurse their young ones.<br>But the daughter of my people has become cruel,<br>like the ostriches in the wilderness.

<sup>4</sup> The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.<br>The young children ask for bread,<br>and no one breaks it for them.

<sup>5</sup> Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.<br>Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.

<sup>6</sup> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,<br>which was overthrown as in a moment.<br>No hands were laid on her.

<sup>7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow.<br>They were whiter than milk.<br>They were more ruddy in body than rubies.<br>Their polishing was like sapphire.

<sup>8</sup> Their appearance is blacker than a coal.<br>They are not known in the streets.<br>Their skin clings to their bones.<br>It is withered.<br>It has become like wood.

<sup>9</sup> Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;<br>for these pine away, stricken through,<br>for lack of the fruits of the field.

<sup>10</sup> The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.<br>They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh has accomplished his wrath.<br>He has poured out his fierce anger.<br>He has kindled a fire in Zion,<br>which has devoured its foundations.

<sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth didn’t believe,<br>neither did all the inhabitants of the world,<br>that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> It is because of the sins of her prophets<br>and the iniquities of her priests,<br>that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.

<sup>14</sup> They wander as blind men in the streets.<br>They are polluted with blood,<br>So that men can’t touch their garments.

<sup>15</sup> “Go away!” they cried to them.<br>“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!<br>When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,<br>“They can’t live here any more.”

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s anger has scattered them.<br>He will not pay attention to them any more.<br>They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.<br>They didn’t favor the elders.

<sup>17</sup> Our eyes still fail,<br>looking in vain for our help.<br>In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.

<sup>18</sup> They hunt our steps,<br>so that we can’t go in our streets.<br>Our end is near.<br>Our days are fulfilled,<br>for our end has come.

<sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.<br>They chased us on the mountains.<br>They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.

<sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils,<br>the anointed of Yahweh,<br>was taken in their pits;<br>of whom we said,<br>under his shadow we will live among the nations.

<sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,<br>who dwells in the land of Uz.<br>The cup will pass through to you also.<br>You will be drunken,<br>and will make yourself naked.

<sup>22</sup> The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.<br>He will no more carry you away into captivity.<br>He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.<br>He will uncover your sins.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us.<br>Look, and see our reproach.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,<br>our houses to aliens.<br>
<sup>3</sup> We are orphans and fatherless.<br>Our mothers are as widows.<br>
<sup>4</sup> We must pay for water to drink.<br>Our wood is sold to us.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Our pursuers are on our necks.<br>We are weary, and have no rest.<br>
<sup>6</sup> We have given our hands to the Egyptians,<br>and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned, and are no more.<br>We have borne their iniquities.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Servants rule over us.<br>There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.<br>
<sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the peril of our lives,<br>because of the sword in the wilderness.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven,<br>because of the burning heat of famine.<br>
<sup>11</sup> They ravished the women in Zion,<br>the virgins in the cities of Judah.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Princes were hanged up by their hands.<br>The faces of elders were not honored.<br>
<sup>13</sup> The young men carry millstones.<br>The children stumbled under loads of wood.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The elders have ceased from the gate,<br>and the young men from their music.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart has ceased.<br>Our dance is turned into mourning.<br>
<sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head.<br>Woe to us, for we have sinned!<br>
<sup>17</sup> For this our heart is faint.<br>For these things our eyes are dim:<br>
<sup>18</sup> for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.<br>The foxes walk on it.

<sup>19</sup> You, Yahweh, remain forever.<br>Your throne is from generation to generation.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Why do you forget us forever,<br>and forsake us for so long a time?<br>
<sup>21</sup> Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned.<br>Renew our days as of old.<br>
<sup>22</sup> But you have utterly rejected us.<br>You are very angry against us.
