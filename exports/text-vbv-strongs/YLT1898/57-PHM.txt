001:001 ¶ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
001:002 and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:
001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
001:004 I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,
001:005 hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
001:006 that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus;
001:007 for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
001:008 Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit-
001:009 because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;
001:010 I entreat thee concerning my child-whom I did beget in my bonds-Onesimus,
001:011 who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,
001:012 whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,
001:013 whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,
001:014 and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,
001:015 for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,
001:016 no more as a servant, but above a servant-a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!
001:017 If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,
001:018 and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;
001:019 I, Paul did write with my hand, I-I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.
001:020 Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;
001:021 having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;
001:022 and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
001:023 Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)
001:024 Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!
001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.
