001:001 ¶ A man there hath been in the land of Uz-Job his name-and that man hath been perfect and upright-both fearing God, and turning aside from evil.
001:002 And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters,
001:003 and his substance is seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred pairs of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a service very abundant; and that man is greater than any of the sons of the east.
001:004 And his sons have gone and made a banquet-the house of each in his day-and have sent and called to their three sisters to eat and to drink with them;
001:005 and it cometh to pass, when they have gone round the days of the banquet, that Job doth send and sanctify them, and hath risen early in the morning, and caused to ascend burnt-offerings-the number of them all-for Job said, ‘Perhaps my sons have sinned, yet blessed God in their heart.’ Thus doth Job all the days.
001:006 And the day is, that sons of God come in to station themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary in their midst.
001:007 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Whence comest thou?’ And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, ‘From going to and fro in the land, and from walking up and down on it.’
001:008 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Hast thou set thy heart against My servant Job because there is none like him in the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God, and turning aside from evil?’
001:009 And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, ‘For nought is Job fearing God?
001:010 Hast not Thou made a hedge for him, and for his house, and for all that he hath-round about?
001:011 The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, and his substance hath spread in the land, and yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike against anything that he hath-if not: to Thy face he doth bless Thee!’
001:012 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Lo, all that he hath is in thy hand, only unto him put not forth thy hand.’ And the Adversary goeth out from the presence of Jehovah.
001:013 And the day is, that his sons and his daughters are eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born.
001:014 And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith, ‘The oxen have been plowing, and the she-asses feeding by their sides,
001:015 and Sheba doth fall, and take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped-only I alone-to declare it to thee.’
001:016 While this one is speaking another also hath come and saith, ‘Fire of God hath fallen from the heavens, and burneth among the flock, and among the young men, and consumeth them, and I am escaped-only I alone-to declare it to thee.’
001:017 While this one is speaking another also hath come and saith, ‘Chaldeans made three heads, and rush on the camels, and take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped-only I alone-to declare it to thee.’
001:018 While this one is speaking another also hath come and saith, ‘Thy sons and thy daughters are eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born.
001:019 And lo, a great wind hath come from over the wilderness, and striketh against the four corners of the house, and it falleth on the young men, and they are dead, and I am escaped-only I alone-to declare it to thee.’
001:020 And Job riseth, and rendeth his robe, and shaveth his head, and falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance,
001:021 and he saith, ‘Naked came I forth from the womb of my mother, and naked I turn back thither: Jehovah hath given and Jehovah hath taken: let the name of Jehovah be blessed.’
001:022 In all this Job hath not sinned, nor given folly to God.
002:001 ¶ And the day is, that sons of God come in to station themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary in their midst to station himself by Jehovah.
002:002 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Whence camest thou?’ And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, ‘From going to and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.’
002:003 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Hast thou set thy heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!’
002:004 And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, ‘A skin for a skin, and all that a man hath he doth give for his life.
002:005 Yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike unto his bone and unto his flesh-if not: unto Thy face he doth bless Thee!’
002:006 And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, ‘Lo, he is in thy hand; only his life take care of.’
002:007 And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smiteth Job with a sore ulcer from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
002:008 And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it, and he is sitting in the midst of the ashes.
002:009 And his wife saith to him, ‘Still thou art keeping hold on thine integrity: bless God and die.’
002:010 And he saith unto her, ‘As one of the foolish women speaketh, thou speakest; yea, the good we receive from God, and the evil we do not receive.’ In all this Job hath not sinned with his lips.
002:011 And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that hath come upon him, and they come in each from his place-Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite-and they are met together to come in to bemoan him, and to comfort him;
002:012 and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not discerned him, and they lift up their voice and weep, and rend each his robe, and sprinkle dust on their heads-heavenward.
002:013 And they sit with him on the earth seven days and seven nights, and there is none speaking unto him a word when they have seen that the pain hath been very great.
003:001 ¶ After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.
003:002 And Job answereth and saith:-
003:003 Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: ‘A man-child hath been conceived.’
003:004 That day-let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it.
003:005 Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days.
003:006 That night-let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come.
003:007 Lo! that night-let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it.
003:008 Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan.
003:009 Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of the dawn.
003:010 Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.
003:011 Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!
003:012 Wherefore have knees been before me? And what are breasts, that I suck?
003:013 For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept-then there is rest to me,
003:014 With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes for themselves.
003:015 Or with princes-they have gold, They are filling their houses with silver.
003:016 (Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants-they have not seen light.)
003:017 There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do the wearied in power.
003:018 Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard the voice of an exactor,
003:019 Small and great are there the same. And a servant is free from his lord.
003:020 Why giveth He to the miserable light, And life to the bitter soul?
003:021 Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures.
003:022 Who are glad-unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave.
003:023 To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?
003:024 For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters are my roarings.
003:025 For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me.
003:026 I was not safe-nor was I quiet- Nor was I at rest-and trouble cometh!
004:001 ¶ And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:-
004:002 Hath one tried a word with thee?- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?
004:003 Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.
004:004 The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.
004:005 But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.
004:006 Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope-the perfection of thy ways?
004:007 Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?
004:008 As I have seen-ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!
004:009 From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.
004:010 The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.
004:011 An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.
004:012 And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.
004:013 In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,
004:014 Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.
004:015 And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;
004:016 It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude is over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:
004:017 ‘Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?
004:018 Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.’
004:019 Also-the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation is in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)
004:020 From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.
004:021 Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!
005:001 ¶ Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?
005:002 For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,
005:003 I-I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,
005:004 Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer.
005:005 Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.
005:006 For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery.
005:007 For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.
005:008 Yet I-I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,
005:009 Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering.
005:010 Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places.
005:011 To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high in safety.
005:012 Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.
005:013 Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,
005:014 By day they meet darkness, And as night-they grope at noon.
005:015 And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,
005:016 And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth.
005:017 Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,
005:018 For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal.
005:019 In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee.
005:020 In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword.
005:021 When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh.
005:022 At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid.
005:023 (For with sons of the field is thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)
005:024 And thou hast known that thy tent is peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not,
005:025 And hast known that numerous is Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth;
005:026 Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season.
005:027 Lo, this-we searched it out-it is right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!
006:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
006:002 O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed, And my calamity in balances They would lift up together!
006:003 For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore my words have been rash.
006:004 For arrows of the Mighty are with me, Whose poison is drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves for me!
006:005 Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his provender?
007:001 ¶ Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?
007:002 As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,
007:003 So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.
007:004 If I lay down then I said, ‘When do I rise!’ And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.
007:005 Clothed hath been my flesh with worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,
007:006 My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.
007:007 Remember Thou that my life is a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.
007:008 The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes are upon me-and I am not.
007:009 Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.
007:010 He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.
007:011 Also I-I withhold not my mouth- I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.
007:012 A sea-monster am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?
007:013 When I said, ‘My bed doth comfort me,’ He taketh away in my talking my couch.
007:014 And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,
007:015 And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.
007:016 I have wasted away-not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days are vanity.
007:017 What is man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?
007:018 And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?
007:019 How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.
007:020 I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself-and what?
007:021 Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me-and I am not!
008:001 ¶ And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:-
008:002 Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind-sayings of thy mouth?
008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?
008:004 If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,
008:005 If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,
008:006 If pure and upright thou art, Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness.
008:007 And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great.
008:008 For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,
008:009 (For of yesterday we are, and we know not, For a shadow are our days on earth.)
008:010 Do they not shew thee-speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?
008:011 ‘Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?
008:012 While it is in its budding-uncropped, Even before any herb it withereth.
008:013 So are the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish,
008:014 Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust.
008:015 He leaneth on his house-and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it-and it abideth not.
008:016 Green he is before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out.
008:017 By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for.
008:018 If one doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee!
008:019 Lo, this is the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.’
008:020 Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers.
008:021 While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,
008:022 Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!
009:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
009:002 Truly I have known that it is so, And what-is man righteous with God?
009:003 If he delight to strive with Him- He doth not answer him one of a thousand.
009:004 Wise in heart and strong in power- Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?
009:005 Who is removing mountains, And they have not known, Who hath overturned them in His anger.
009:006 Who is shaking earth from its place, And its pillars move themselves.
009:007 Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars He sealeth up.
009:008 Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the heights of the sea,
009:009 Making Osh, Kesil, and Kimah, And the inner chambers of the south.
009:010 Doing great things till there is no searching, And wonderful, till there is no numbering.
009:011 Lo, He goeth over by me, and I see not, And He passeth on, and I attend not to it.
009:012 Lo, He snatches away, who bringeth it back? Who saith unto Him, ‘What dost Thou?’
009:013 God doth not turn back His anger, Under Him bowed have proud helpers.
009:014 How much less do I-I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?
009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, I answer not, For my judgment I make supplication.
009:016 Though I had called and He answereth me, I do not believe that He giveth ear to my voice.
009:017 Because with a tempest He bruiseth me, And hath multiplied my wounds for nought.
009:018 He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit, But filleth me with bitter things.
009:019 If of power, lo, the Strong One; And if of judgment-who doth convene me?
009:020 If I be righteous, Mine mouth doth declare me wicked, Perfect I am!-it declareth me perverse.
009:021 Perfect I am!-I know not my soul, I despise my life.
009:022 It is the same thing, therefore I said, ‘The perfect and the wicked He is consuming.’
009:023 If a scourge doth put to death suddenly, At the trial of the innocent He laugheth.
009:024 Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth, If not-where, who is he?
009:025 My days have been swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have not seen good,
009:026 They have passed on with ships of reed, As an eagle darteth on food.
009:027 Though I say, ‘I forget my talking, I forsake my corner, and I brighten up!’
009:028 I have been afraid of all my griefs, I have known that Thou dost not acquit me.
009:029 I-I am become wicked; why is this? In vain I labour.
009:030 If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with soap my hands,
009:031 Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have abominated me.
009:032 But if a man like myself-I answer him, We come together into judgment.
009:033 If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand on us both.
009:034 He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth not make me afraid,
009:035 I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with myself.
010:001 ¶ My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.
010:002 I say unto God, ‘Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive with me.
010:003 Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?
010:004 Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth-seest Thou?
010:005 As the days of man are Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?
010:006 That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?
010:007 For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.
010:008 Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!
010:009 Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.
010:010 Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?
010:011 Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me.
010:012 Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.
010:013 And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this is with Thee.
010:014 If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,
010:015 If I have done wickedly-woe to me, And righteously-I lift not up my head, Full of shame-then see my affliction,
010:016 And it riseth-as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back- Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.
010:017 Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare are with me.
010:018 And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.
010:019 As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,
010:020 Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,
010:021 Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,
010:022 A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade-and no order, And the shining is as thick darkness.’
011:001 ¶ And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith:-
011:002 Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?
011:003 Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!
011:004 And thou sayest, ‘Pure is my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.’
011:005 And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.
011:006 And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, Some of thine iniquity.
011:007 By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?
011:008 Heights of the heavens!-what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol!-what knowest thou?
011:009 Longer than earth is its measure, And broader than the sea.
011:010 If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?
011:011 For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider it!
011:012 And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.
011:013 If thou-thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,
011:014 If iniquity is in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.
011:015 For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.
011:016 For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.
011:017 And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest-as the morning thou art.
011:018 And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched-in confidence thou liest down,
011:019 And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;
011:020 And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope is a breathing out of soul!
012:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
012:002 Truly-ye are the people, And with you doth wisdom die.
012:003 I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, And with whom is there not like these?
012:004 A laughter to his friend I am: ‘He calleth to God, and He answereth him,’ A laughter is the perfect righteous one.
012:005 A torch-despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet.
012:006 At peace are the tents of spoilers, And those provoking God have confidence, He into whose hand God hath brought.
012:007 And yet, ask, I pray thee, One of the beasts, and it doth shew thee, And a fowl of the heavens, And it doth declare to thee.
012:008 Or talk to the earth, and it sheweth thee, And fishes of the sea recount to thee:
012:009 ‘Who hath not known in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this?
012:010 In whose hand is the breath of every living thing, And the spirit of all flesh of man.’
012:011 Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?
012:012 With the very aged is wisdom, And with length of days understanding.
012:013 With Him are wisdom and might, To him are counsel and understanding.
012:014 Lo, He breaketh down, and it is not built up, He shutteth against a man, And it is not opened.
012:015 Lo, He keepeth in the waters, and they are dried up, And he sendeth them forth, And they overturn the land.
012:016 With Him are strength and wisdom, His the deceived and deceiver.
012:017 Causing counsellors to go away a spoil, And judges He maketh foolish.
012:018 The bands of kings He hath opened, And He bindeth a girdle on their loins.
012:019 Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth.
012:020 Turning aside the lip of the stedfast, And the reason of the aged He taketh away.
012:021 Pouring contempt upon princes, And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble.
012:022 Removing deep things out of darkness, And He bringeth out to light death-shade.
012:023 Magnifying the nations, and He destroyeth them, Spreading out the nations, and He quieteth them.
012:024 Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land, And he causeth them to wander In vacancy-no way!
012:025 They feel darkness, and not light, He causeth them to wander as a drunkard.
013:001 ¶ Lo, all-hath mine eye seen, Heard hath mine ear, and it attendeth to it.
013:002 According to your knowledge I have known-also I. I am not fallen more than you.
013:003 Yet I for the Mighty One do speak, And to argue for God I delight.
013:004 And yet, ye are forgers of falsehood, Physicians of nought-all of you,
013:005 O that ye would keep perfectly silent, And it would be to you for wisdom.
013:006 Hear, I pray you, my argument, And to the pleadings of my lips attend,
013:007 For God do ye speak perverseness? And for Him do ye speak deceit?
013:008 His face do ye accept, if for God ye strive?
013:009 Is it good that He doth search you, If, as one mocketh at a man, ye mock at Him?
013:010 He doth surely reprove you, if in secret ye accept faces.
013:011 Doth not His excellency terrify you? And His dread fall upon you?
013:012 Your remembrances are similes of ashes, For high places of clay your heights.
013:013 Keep silent from me, and I speak, And pass over me doth what?
013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth? And my soul put in my hand?
013:015 Lo, He doth slay me-I wait not! Only, my ways unto His face I argue.
013:016 Also-He is to me for salvation, For the profane cometh not before Him.
013:017 Hear ye diligently my word, And my declaration with your ears.
013:018 Lo, I pray you, I have set in order the cause, I have known that I am righteous.
013:019 Who is he that doth strive with me? For now I keep silent and gasp.
013:020 Only two things, O God, do with me: Then from Thy face I am not hidden.
013:021 Thy hand put far off from me, And Thy terror let not terrify me.
013:022 And call Thou, and I-I answer, Or-I speak, and answer Thou me.
013:023 How many iniquities and sins have I? My transgression and my sin let me know.
013:024 Why dost Thou hide Thy face? And reckonest me for an enemy to Thee?
013:025 A leaf driven away dost Thou terrify? And the dry stubble dost Thou pursue?
013:026 For Thou writest against me bitter things, And causest me to possess iniquities of my youth:
013:027 And puttest in the stocks my feet, And observest all my paths, On the roots of my feet Thou settest a print,
013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, weareth away, As a garment hath a moth consumed him.
014:001 ¶ Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!
014:002 As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.
014:003 Also-on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee.
014:004 Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
014:005 If determined are his days, The number of his months are with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;
014:006 Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day.
014:007 For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease.
014:008 If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,
014:009 From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant.
014:010 And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where is he?
014:011 Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry.
014:012 And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep.
014:013 O that in Sheol Thou wouldest conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me.
014:014 If a man dieth-doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.
014:015 Thou dost call, and I-I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire.
014:016 But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin.
014:017 Sealed up in a bag is my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity.
014:018 And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place.
014:019 Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed.
014:020 Thou prevailest over him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away.
014:021 Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them.
014:022 Only-his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.’
015:001 ¶ And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:-
015:002 Doth a wise man answer with vain knowledge? And fill with an east wind his belly?
015:003 To reason with a word not useful? And speeches-no profit in them?
015:004 Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God.
015:005 For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile.
015:006 Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee.
015:007 The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?
015:008 Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?
015:009 What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou-and it is not with us?
015:010 Both the gray-headed And the very aged are among us- Greater than thy father in days.
015:011 Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word is with thee,
015:012 What-doth thine heart take thee away? And what-are thine eyes high?
015:013 For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:
015:014 What is man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?
015:015 Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.
015:016 Also-surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.
015:017 I shew thee-hearken to me- And this I have seen and declare:
015:018 Which the wise declare- And have not hid-from their fathers.
015:019 To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:
015:020 ‘All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one.
015:021 A fearful voice is in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him.
015:022 He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched is he for the sword.
015:023 He is wandering for bread-‘Where is it?’ He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.
015:024 Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster.
015:025 For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty.
015:026 He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields.
015:027 For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over his confidence.
015:028 And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps.
015:029 He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance.
015:030 He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!
015:031 Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence.
015:032 Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green.
015:033 He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom.
015:034 For the company of the profane is gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery.
015:035 To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit.
016:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
016:002 I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters are ye all.
016:003 Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?
016:004 I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul’s stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head.
016:005 I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing.
016:006 If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease-what goeth from me?
016:007 Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,
016:008 And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.
016:009 His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.
016:010 They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves.
016:011 God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over.
016:012 At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark.
016:013 Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.
016:014 He breaketh me-breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one.
016:015 Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn.
016:016 My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids is death-shade.
016:017 Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.
016:018 O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry.
016:019 Also, now, lo, in the heavens is my witness, And my testifier in the high places.
016:020 My interpreter is my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped:
016:021 And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend.
016:022 When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go.
017:001 ¶ My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished-graves are for me.
017:002 If not-mockeries are with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.
017:003 Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?
017:004 For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.
017:005 For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.
017:006 And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.
017:007 And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.
017:008 Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.
017:009 And the righteous layeth hold on his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And-dumb are they all.
017:010 Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.
017:011 My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!
017:012 Night for day they appoint, Light is near because of darkness.
017:013 If I wait-Sheol is my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch.
017:014 To corruption I have called:- ‘Thou art my father.’ ‘My mother’ and ‘my sister?’-to the worm.
017:015 And where is now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?
017:016 To the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.
018:001 ¶ And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:-
018:002 When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.
018:003 Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!
018:004 (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?
018:005 Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.
018:006 The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.
018:007 Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.
018:008 For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.
018:009 Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.
018:010 Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.
018:011 Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him-at his feet.
018:012 Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.
018:013 It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death’s first-born.
018:014 Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.
018:015 It dwelleth in his tent-out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.
018:016 From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.
018:017 His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.
018:018 They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.
018:019 He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.
018:020 At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.
018:021 Only these are tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.
019:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
019:002 Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?
019:003 These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make yourselves strange to me-
019:004 And also-truly, I have erred, With me doth my error remain.
019:005 If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide against me my reproach;
019:006 Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net against me hath set round,
019:007 Lo, I cry out-violence, and am not answered, I cry aloud, and there is no judgment.
019:008 My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths darkness He placeth.
019:009 Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth the crown from my head.
019:010 He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth like a tree my hope.
019:011 And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to Him as His adversaries.
019:012 Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against me their way, And encamp round about my tent.
019:013 My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me.
019:014 Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me,
019:015 Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon me: An alien I have been in their eyes.
019:016 To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With my mouth I make supplication to him.
019:017 My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the sons of my mother’s womb.
019:018 Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak against me.
019:019 Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I have loved, Have been turned against me.
019:020 To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I deliver myself with the skin of my teeth.
019:021 Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath stricken against me.
019:022 Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?
019:023 Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth grant that in a book they may be graven?
019:024 With a pen of iron and lead- For ever in a rock they may be hewn.
019:025 That-I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last, For the dust he doth rise.
019:026 And after my skin hath compassed this body, Then from my flesh I see God:
019:027 Whom I-I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom.
019:028 But ye say, ‘Why do we pursue after him?’ And the root of the matter hath been found in me.
019:029 Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious are the punishments of the sword, That ye may know that there is a judgment.
020:001 ¶ And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith:-
020:002 Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me.
020:003 The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:
020:004 This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?
020:005 That the singing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the profane for a moment,
020:006 Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike-
020:007 As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: ‘Where is he?’
020:008 As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,
020:009 The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him.
020:010 His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth.
020:011 His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down.
020:012 Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,
020:013 Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,
020:014 His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps is in his heart.
020:015 Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out.
020:016 Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper.
020:017 He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter.
020:018 He is giving back what he laboured for, And doth not consume it; As a bulwark is his exchange, and he exults not.
020:019 For he oppressed-he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it.
020:020 For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.
020:021 There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay.
020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.
020:023 It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating.
020:024 He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass.
020:025 One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him are terrors.
020:026 All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.
020:027 Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him.
020:028 Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger.
020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.
021:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
021:002 Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation.
021:003 Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking-ye may deride.
021:004 I-to man is my complaint? and if so, wherefore May not my temper become short?
021:005 Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth.
021:006 Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh hath taken fright.
021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea, they have been mighty in wealth.
021:008 Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And their offspring before their eyes.
021:009 Their houses are peace without fear, Nor is a rod of God upon them.
021:010 His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry.
021:011 They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their children skip,
021:012 They lift themselves up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of an organ.
021:013 They wear out in good their days, And in a moment to Sheol go down.
021:014 And they say to God, ‘Turn aside from us, And the knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired.
021:015 What is the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?’
021:016 Lo, not in their hand is their good, (The counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)
021:017 How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His anger.
021:018 They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane hath stolen away,
021:019 God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth recompense unto him-and he knoweth.
021:020 His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the Mighty he drinketh.
021:021 For what is his delight in his house after him, And the number of his months cut off?
021:022 To God doth one teach knowledge, And He the high doth judge?
021:023 This one dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease and quiet.
021:024 His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones doth moisten.
021:025 And this one dieth with a bitter soul, And have not eaten with gladness.
021:026 Together-on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth cover them over.
021:027 Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me ye do wrongfully.
021:028 For ye say, ‘Where is the house of the noble? And where the tent-The tabernacles of the wicked?’
021:029 Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?
021:030 That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought.
021:031 Who doth declare to his face his way? And for that which he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him?
021:032 And he-to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.
021:033 Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering.
021:034 And how do ye comfort me with vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?
022:001 ¶ And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:-
022:002 To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?
022:003 Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?
022:004 Because of thy reverence Doth He reason with thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:
022:005 Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities.
022:006 For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the garments of the naked Thou dost strip off.
022:007 Thou causest not the weary to drink water, And from the hungry thou withholdest bread.
022:008 As to the man of arm-he hath the earth, And the accepted of face-he dwelleth in it.
022:009 Widows thou hast sent away empty, And the arms of the fatherless are bruised.
022:010 Therefore round about thee are snares, And trouble thee doth fear suddenly.
022:011 Or darkness-thou dost not see, And abundance of waters doth cover thee.
022:012 Is not God high in heaven? And see the summit of the stars, That they are high.
022:013 And thou hast said, ‘What-hath God known? Through thickness doth He judge?
022:014 Thick clouds are a secret place to Him, And He doth not see;’ And the circle of the heavens He walketh habitually,
022:015 The path of the age dost thou observe, That men of iniquity have trodden?
022:016 Who have been cut down unexpectedly, A flood is poured out on their foundation.
022:017 Those saying to God, ‘Turn aside from us,’ And what doth the Mighty One to them?
022:018 And he hath filled their houses with good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)
022:019 See do the righteous and they rejoice, And the innocent mocketh at them,
022:020 ‘Surely our substance hath not been cut off, And their excellency hath fire consumed.’
022:021 Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase is good.
022:022 Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart.
022:023 If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents.
022:024 So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering.
022:025 And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver is strength to thee.
022:026 For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,
022:027 Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest.
022:028 And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone.
022:029 For they have made low, And thou sayest, ‘Lift up.’ And the bowed down of eyes he saveth.
022:030 He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands.
023:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
023:002 Also-to-day is my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.
023:003 O that I had known-and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,
023:004 I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill with arguments.
023:005 I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.
023:006 In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth it in me.
023:007 There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.
023:008 Lo, forward I go-and He is not, And backward-and I perceive him not.
023:009 To the left in His working-and I see not, He is covered on the right, and I behold not.
023:010 For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me-as gold I go forth.
023:011 On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,
023:012 The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.
023:013 And He is in one mind, And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired-and He doth it.
023:014 For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him.
023:015 Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.
023:016 And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.
023:017 For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.
024:001 ¶ Wherefore from the Mighty One Times have not been hidden, And those knowing Him have not seen His days.
024:002 The borders they reach, A drove they have taken violently away, Yea, they do evil.
024:003 The ass of the fatherless they lead away, They take in pledge the ox of the widow,
024:004 They turn aside the needy from the way, Together have hid the poor of the earth.
024:005 Lo, wild asses in a wilderness, They have gone out about their work, Seeking early for prey, A mixture for himself-food for young ones.
024:006 In a field his provender they reap, And the vineyard of the wicked they glean.
024:007 The naked they cause to lodge Without clothing. And there is no covering in the cold.
024:008 From the inundation of hills they are wet, And without a refuge-have embraced a rock.
024:009 They take violently away From the breast the orphan, And on the poor they lay a pledge.
024:010 Naked, they have gone without clothing, And hungry-have taken away a sheaf.
024:011 Between their walls they make oil, Wine-presses they have trodden, and thirst.
024:012 Because of enmity men do groan, And the soul of pierced ones doth cry, And God doth not give praise.
024:013 They have been among rebellious ones of light, They have not discerned His ways, Nor abode in His paths.
024:014 At the light doth the murderer rise, He doth slay the poor and needy, And in the night he is as a thief.
024:015 And the eye of an adulterer Hath observed the twilight, Saying, ‘No eye doth behold me.’ And he putteth the face in secret.
024:016 He hath dug in the darkness-houses; By day they shut themselves up, They have not known light.
024:017 When together, morning is to them death shade, When he discerneth the terrors of death shade.
024:018 Light he is on the face of the waters, Vilified is their portion in the earth, He turneth not the way of vineyards.
024:019 Drought-also heat-consume snow-waters, Sheol those who have sinned.
024:020 Forget him doth the womb, Sweeten on him doth the worm, No more is he remembered, And broken as a tree is wickedness.
024:021 Treating evil the barren who beareth not, And to the widow he doth no good,
024:022 And hath drawn the mighty by his power, He riseth, and none believeth in life.
024:023 He giveth to him confidence, and he is supported, And his eyes are on their ways.
024:024 High they were for a little, and they are not, And they have been brought low. As all others they are shut up, And as the head of an ear of corn cut off.
024:025 And if not now, who doth prove me a liar, And doth make of nothing my word?
025:001 ¶ And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:-
025:002 The rule and fear are with Him, Making peace in His high places.
025:003 Is their any number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?
025:004 And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure-born of a woman?
025:005 Lo-unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.
025:006 How much less man-a grub, And the son of man-a worm!
026:001 ¶ And Job answereth and saith:-
026:002 What-thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!
026:003 What-thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.
026:004 With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?
026:005 The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.
026:006 Naked is Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction.
026:007 Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,
026:008 Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.
026:009 Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.
026:010 A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.
026:011 Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.
026:012 By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.
026:013 By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.
026:014 Lo, these are the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?
027:001 ¶ And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith:-
027:002 God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty-He made my soul bitter.
027:003 For all the while my breath is in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils.
027:004 My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit.
027:005 Pollution to me-if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me.
027:006 On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.
027:007 As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse.
027:008 For what is the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?
027:009 His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?
027:010 On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?
027:011 I shew you by the hand of God, That which is with the Mighty I hide not.
027:012 Lo, ye-all of you-have seen, And why is this-ye are altogether vain?
027:013 This is the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive.
027:014 If his sons multiply-for them is a sword. And his offspring are not satisfied with bread.
027:015 His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep.
027:016 If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,
027:017 He prepareth-and the righteous putteth it on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion.
027:018 He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made.
027:019 Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not.
027:020 Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind.
027:021 Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,
027:022 And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth.
027:023 It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place.
028:001 ¶ Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;
028:002 Iron from the dust is taken, And from the firm stone brass.
028:003 An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade.
028:004 A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered.
028:005 The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire.
028:006 A place of the sapphire are its stones, And it hath dust of gold.
028:007 A path-not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,
028:008 Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion.
028:009 Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains.
028:010 Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen.
028:011 From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out to light.
028:012 And the wisdom-whence is it found? And where is this, the place of understanding?
028:013 Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living.
028:014 The deep hath said, ‘It is not in me,’ And the sea hath said, ‘It is not with me.’
028:015 Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed-its price.
028:016 It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,
028:017 Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor is its exchange a vessel of fine gold.
028:018 Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom is above rubies.
028:019 Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued.
028:020 And the wisdom-whence doth it come? And where is this, the place of understanding?
028:021 It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.
028:022 Destruction and death have said: ‘With our ears we have heard its fame.’
028:023 God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place.
028:024 For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,
028:025 To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure.
028:026 In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,
028:027 Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,
028:028 And He saith to man:- ‘Lo, fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to turn from evil is understanding.’
029:001 ¶ And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith:-
029:002 Who doth make me as in months past, As in the days of God’s preserving me?
029:003 In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk through darkness.
029:004 As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent.
029:005 When yet the Mighty One is with me. Round about me-my young ones,
029:006 When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock is with me rivulets of oil.
029:007 When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat.
029:008 Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen-they stood up.
029:009 Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth.
029:010 The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved.
029:011 For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth to me.
029:012 For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper.
029:013 The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing.
029:014 Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice.
029:015 Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame am I.
029:016 A father I am to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out.
029:017 And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey.
029:018 And I say, ‘With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.’
029:019 My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch.
029:020 My honour is fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed.
029:021 To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel.
029:022 After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,
029:023 And they wait as for rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide As for the latter rain.
029:024 I laugh unto them-they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall.
029:025 I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.
030:001 ¶ And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock.
030:002 Also-the power of their hands, why is it to me? On them hath old age perished.
030:003 With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,
030:004 Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots is their food.
030:005 From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),
030:006 In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts.
030:007 Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together.
030:008 Sons of folly-even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land.
030:009 And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword.
030:010 They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit.
030:011 Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away.
030:012 On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity.
030:013 They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, ‘He hath no helper.’
030:014 As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves.
030:015 He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away.
030:016 And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction.
030:017 At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down.
030:018 By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me.
030:019 Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.
030:020 I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me.
030:021 Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppressest me.
030:022 Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest-Thou levellest me.
030:023 For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And to the house appointed for all living.
030:024 Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety.
030:025 Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.
030:026 When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for light, and darkness cometh.
030:027 My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction.
030:028 Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry.
030:029 A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich.
030:030 My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,
030:031 And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping.
031:001 ¶ A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what-do I attend to a virgin?
031:002 And what is the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?
031:003 Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?
031:004 Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?
031:005 If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,
031:006 He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity.
031:007 If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,
031:008 Let me sow-and another eat, And my products let be rooted out.
031:009 If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,
031:010 Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend.
031:011 For it is a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;
031:012 For a fire it is, to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root,
031:013 If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,
031:014 Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?
031:015 Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One.
031:016 If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,
031:017 And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it,
031:018 (But from my youth He grew up with me as with a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.)
031:019 If I see any perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy,
031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,
031:021 If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in him the gate of my court,
031:022 My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken.
031:023 For a dread unto me is calamity from God, And because of His excellency I am not able.
031:024 If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, ‘My trust,’
031:025 If I rejoice because great is my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found,
031:026 If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,
031:027 And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,
031:028 It also is a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above.
031:029 If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,
031:030 Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life.
031:031 If not-say ye, O men of my tent, ‘O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.’
031:032 In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open.
031:033 If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,
031:034 Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening.
031:035 Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written.
031:036 If not-on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself.
031:037 The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him.
031:038 If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,
031:039 If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,
031:040 Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished.
032:001 ¶ And these three men cease from answering Job, for he is righteous in his own eyes,
032:002 and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;
032:003 and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.
032:004 And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days.
032:005 And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth.
032:006 And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:- Young I am in days, and ye are age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.
032:007 I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.
032:008 Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand.
032:009 The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment.
032:010 Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion-even I.
032:011 Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings.
032:012 And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, Or answerer of his sayings among you.
032:013 Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man.
032:014 And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him.
032:015 (They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words.
032:016 And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)
032:017 I answer, even I-my share, I shew my opinion-even I.
032:018 For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,
032:019 Lo, my breast is as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up.
032:020 I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer.
032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,
032:022 For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away.
033:001 ¶ And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and to all my words give ear.
033:002 Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate.
033:003 Of the uprightness of my heart are my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.
033:004 The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me.
033:005 If thou art able-answer me, Set in array before me-station thyself.
033:006 Lo, I am, according to thy word, for God, From the clay I-I also, have been formed.
033:007 Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy.
033:008 Surely-thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:
033:009 ‘Pure am I, without transgression, Innocent am I, and I have no iniquity.
033:010 Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,
033:011 He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.’
033:012 Lo, in this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man.
033:013 Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When for all His matters He answereth not?
033:014 For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)
033:015 In a dream-a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.
033:016 Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:
033:017 To turn aside man from doing, And pride from man He concealeth.
033:018 He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart.
033:019 And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones is enduring.
033:020 And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food.
033:021 His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!
033:022 And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death.
033:023 If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter-one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:
033:024 Then He doth favour him and saith, ‘Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.’
033:025 Fresher is his flesh than a child’s, He returneth to the days of his youth.
033:026 He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness.
033:027 He looketh on men, and saith, ‘I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.
033:028 He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.’
033:029 Lo, all these doth God work, Twice-thrice with man,
033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living.
033:031 Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I-I do speak.
033:032 If there are words-answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee.
033:033 If there are not-hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom.
034:001 ¶ And Elihu answereth and saith:
034:002 Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.
034:003 For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.
034:004 Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what is good.
034:005 For Job hath said, ‘I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,
034:006 Against my right do I lie? Mortal is mine arrow-without transgression.’
034:007 Who is a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,
034:008 And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.
034:009 For he hath said, ‘It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.’
034:010 Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Mighty to do perverseness:
034:011 For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.
034:012 Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.
034:013 Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?
034:014 If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.
034:015 Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.
034:016 And if there is understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.
034:017 Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?
034:018 Who hath said to a king-‘Worthless,’ Unto princes-‘Wicked?’
034:019 That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands are all of them.
034:020 In a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.
034:021 For His eyes are on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.
034:022 There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;
034:023 For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,
034:024 He breaketh the mighty-no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.
034:025 Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.
034:026 As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.
034:027 Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,
034:028 To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.
034:029 And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, It is the same.
034:030 From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;
034:031 For unto God hath any said: ‘I have taken away, I do not corruptly,
034:032 Besides that which I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done-I do not add?’
034:033 By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused- That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.
034:034 Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.
034:035 Job-not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words are not with wisdom.
034:036 My Father! let Job be tried-unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,
034:037 For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.
035:001 ¶ And Elihu answereth and saith:-
035:002 This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said- ‘My righteousness is more than God’s?’
035:003 For thou sayest, ‘What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?’
035:004 I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,
035:005 Behold attentively the heavens-and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou.
035:006 If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?
035:007 If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?
035:008 For a man like thyself is thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness.
035:009 Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.
035:010 And none said, ‘Where is God my maker? Giving songs in the night,
035:011 Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.’
035:012 There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers.
035:013 Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it.
035:014 Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment is before Him, and stay for Him.
035:015 And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.
035:016 And Job with vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth.
036:001 ¶ And Elihu addeth and saith:-
036:002 Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God are words.
036:003 I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness.
036:004 For, truly, my words are not false, The perfect in knowledge is with thee.
036:005 Lo, God is mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty in power and heart.
036:006 He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;
036:007 He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And from kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,
036:008 And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,
036:009 Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,
036:010 And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity.
036:011 If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness.
036:012 And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge.
036:013 And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them.
036:014 Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled.
036:015 He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear.
036:016 And also He moved thee from a strait place, To a broad place-no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness.
036:017 And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld-because of fury,
036:018 Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside.
036:019 Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power.
036:020 Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead.
036:021 Take heed-do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than on affliction.
036:022 Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who is like Him-a teacher?
036:023 Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, ‘Thou hast done iniquity?’
036:024 Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.
036:025 All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar.
036:026 Lo, God is high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there is no searching.
036:027 When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,
036:028 Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly.
036:029 Yea, doth any understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?
036:030 Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,
036:031 For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance.
036:032 By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,
036:033 He sheweth by it to his friend substance, Anger against perversity.
037:001 ¶ Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place.
037:002 Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth.
037:003 Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light is over the skirts of the earth.
037:004 After it roar doth a voice- He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard.
037:005 God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not.
037:006 For to snow He saith, ‘Be on the earth.’ And the small rain and great rain of His power.
037:007 Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work.
037:008 And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue.
037:009 From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds-cold,
037:010 From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,
037:011 Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light.
037:012 And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth.
037:013 Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness-He doth cause it to come.
037:014 Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.
037:015 Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?
037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?
037:017 How thy garments are warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south?
037:018 Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds-strong as a hard mirror!
037:019 Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness.
037:020 Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up.
037:021 And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it is in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them.
037:022 From the golden north it cometh, Beside God is fearful honour.
037:023 The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,
037:024 Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart.
038:001 ¶ And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:-
038:002 Who is this-darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?
038:003 Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.
038:004 Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.
038:005 Who placed its measures-if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?
038:006 On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?
038:007 In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,
038:008 And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.
038:009 In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,
038:010 And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,
038:011 And say, ‘Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.’
038:012 Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?
038:013 To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,
038:014 It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.
038:015 And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.
038:016 Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?
038:017 Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?
038:018 Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare-if thou hast known it all.
038:019 Where is this-the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where is this-its place?
038:020 That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.
038:021 Thou hast known-for then thou art born And the number of thy days are many!
038:022 Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?
038:023 That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.
038:024 Where is this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth.
038:025 Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?
038:026 To cause it to rain on a land-no man, A wilderness-no man in it.
038:027 To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?
038:028 Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
038:029 From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?
038:030 As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.
038:031 Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?
038:032 Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?
038:033 Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?
038:034 Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?
038:035 Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, ‘Behold us?’
038:036 Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?
038:037 Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,
038:038 In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?
038:039 Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?
038:040 When they bow down in dens- Abide in a thicket for a covert?
038:041 Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.
039:001 ¶ Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!
039:002 Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!
039:003 They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely, Their pangs they cast forth.
039:004 Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they have gone out, And have not returned to them.
039:005 Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of the wild ass who opened?
039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings the barren land,
039:007 He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an exactor he heareth not.
039:008 The range of mountains is his pasture, And after every green thing he seeketh.
039:009 Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?
039:010 Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow with his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?
039:011 Dost thou trust in him because great is his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?
039:012 Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And to thy threshing-floor doth gather it?
039:013 The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion of the ostrich or hawk.
039:014 For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she doth warm them,
039:015 And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast of the field tread it down.
039:016 Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain is her labour without fear.
039:017 For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not given a portion To her in understanding:
039:018 At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth at the horse and at his rider.
039:019 Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck with a mane?
039:020 Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting is terrible.
039:021 They dig in a valley, and he rejoiceth in power, He goeth forth to meet the armour.
039:022 He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted, And he turneth not back from the face of the sword.
039:023 Against him rattle doth quiver, The flame of a spear, and a halbert.
039:024 With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground, And remaineth not stedfast Because of the sound of a trumpet.
039:025 Among the trumpets he saith, Aha, And from afar he doth smell battle, Roaring of princes and shouting.
039:026 By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?
039:027 At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?
039:028 A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a rock, and fortress.
039:029 From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his eyes look attentively,
039:030 And his brood gulp up blood, And where the pierced are-there is he!
040:001 ¶ And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith:-
040:002 Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it.
040:003 And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith:-
040:004 Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I have placed on my mouth.
040:005 Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add not.
040:006 And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:-
040:007 Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.
040:008 Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me, That thou mayest be righteous?
040:009 And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?
040:010 Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour and beauty put on.
040:011 Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every proud one, and make him low.
040:012 See every proud one-humble him, And tread down the wicked in their place.
040:013 Hide them in the dust together, Their faces bind in secret.
040:014 And even I-I do praise thee, For thy right hand giveth salvation to thee.
040:015 Lo, I pray thee, Behemoth, that I made with thee: Grass as an ox he eateth.
040:016 Lo, I pray thee, his power is in his loins, And his strength in the muscles of his belly.
040:017 He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together,
040:018 His bones are tubes of brass, His bones are as a bar of iron.
040:019 He is a beginning of the ways of God, His Maker bringeth nigh his sword;
040:020 For food do mountains bear for him, And all the beasts of the field play there.
040:021 Under shades he lieth down, In a secret place of reed and mire.
040:022 Cover him do shades, with their shadow, Cover him do willows of the brook.
040:023 Lo, a flood oppresseth-he doth not haste, He is confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth.
040:024 Before his eyes doth one take him, With snares doth one pierce the nose?
041:001 ¶ Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down-his tongue?
041:002 Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?
041:003 Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?
041:004 Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?
041:005 Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?
041:006 (Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the merchants!)
041:007 Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?
041:008 Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle-do not add!
041:009 Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance is not one cast down?
041:010 None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who is he before Me stationeth himself?
041:011 Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it is mine.
041:012 I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter of might, And the grace of his arrangement.
041:013 Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?
041:014 The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth are terrible.
041:015 A pride-strong ones of shields, Shut up-a close seal.
041:016 One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter between them.
041:017 One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are not separated.
041:018 His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes are as the eyelids of the dawn.
041:019 Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.
041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and reeds.
041:021 His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his mouth goeth forth.
041:022 In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief exult.
041:023 The flakes of his flesh have adhered- Firm upon him-it is not moved.
041:024 His heart is firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower piece.
041:025 From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings they keep themselves free.
041:026 The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear-dart-and lance.
041:027 He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.
041:028 The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by him into stubble are stones of the sling.
041:029 As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.
041:030 Under him are sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on the mire.
041:031 He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as a pot of ointment.
041:032 After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the deep to be hoary.
041:033 There is not on the earth his like, That is made without terror.
041:034 Every high thing he doth see, He is king over all sons of pride.
042:001 ¶ And Job answereth Jehovah and saith:-
042:002 Thou hast known that for all things Thou art able, And not withheld from Thee is any device:
042:003 ‘Who is this, hiding counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore, I have declared, and understand not, Too wonderful for me, and I know not.
042:004 ‘Hear, I pray thee, and I-I do speak, I ask thee, and cause thou me to know.’
042:005 By the hearing of the ear I heard Thee, And now mine eye hath seen Thee.
042:006 Therefore do I loathe it, And I have repented on dust and ashes.
042:007 And it cometh to pass after Jehovah’s speaking these words unto Job, that Jehovah saith unto Eliphaz the Temanite, ‘Burned hath Mine anger against thee, and against thy two friends, because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My servant Job.
042:008 And now, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go ye unto My servant Job, and ye have caused a burnt-offering to ascend for you; and Job My servant doth pray for you, for surely his face I accept, so as not to do with you folly, because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My servant Job.
042:009 And they go-Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite-and do as Jehovah hath spoken unto them; and Jehovah doth accept the face of Job.
042:010 And Jehovah hath turned to the captivity of Job in his praying for his friends, and Jehovah doth add to all that Job hath-to double.
042:011 And come unto him do all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all his former acquaintances, and they eat bread with him in his house, and bemoan him, and comfort him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him, and they gave to him each one kesitah, and each one ring of gold.
042:012 And Jehovah hath blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning, and he hath fourteen thousand of a flock, and six thousand camels, and a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
042:013 And he hath seven sons and three daughters;
042:014 and he calleth the name of the one Jemima, and the name of the second Kezia, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.
042:015 And there have not been found women fair as the daughters of Job in all the land, and their father doth give to them an inheritance in the midst of their brethren.
042:016 And Job liveth after this a hundred and forty years, and seeth his sons, and his sons’ sons, four generations;
042:017 and Job dieth, aged and satisfied with days.
