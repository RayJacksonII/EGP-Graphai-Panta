001:001 ¶ Now it came to pass in the thirtieth H7970 year H8141, in the fourth H7243 [month], in the fifth H2568 [day] of the month H2320, as I [was] among H8432 the captives H1473 by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529, [that] the heavens H8064 were opened H6605 (8738), and I saw H7200 (8799) visions H4759 of God H0430.
001:002 In the fifth H2568 [day] of the month H2320, which [was] the fifth H2549 year H8141 of king H4428 Jehoiachin’s H3112 captivity H1546,
001:003 The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came expressly unto Ezekiel H3168 the priest H3548, the son H1121 of Buzi H0941, in the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778 by the river H5104 Chebar H3529; and the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was there upon him.
001:004 And I looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, a whirlwind H7307 H5591 came H0935 (8802) out of the north H6828, a great H1419 cloud H6051, and a fire H0784 infolding H3947 (8693) itself, and a brightness H5051 [was] about H5439 it, and out of the midst H8432 thereof as the colour H5869 of amber H2830, out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784.
001:005 Also out of the midst H8432 thereof [came] the likeness H1823 of four H0702 living creatures H2416. And this [was] their appearance H4758; they H2007 had the likeness H1823 of a man H0120.
001:006 And every one H0259 had four H0702 faces H6440, and every one H0259 had four H0702 wings H3671.
001:007 And their feet H7272 [were] straight H3477 feet H7272; and the sole H3709 of their feet H7272 [was] like the sole H3709 of a calf’s H5695 foot H7272: and they sparkled H5340 (8802) like the colour H5869 of burnished H7044 brass H5178.
001:008 And [they had] the hands H3027 of a man H0120 under their wings H3671 on their four H0702 sides H7253; and they four H0702 had their faces H6440 and their wings H3671.
001:009 Their wings H3671 [were] joined H2266 (8802) one H0802 to another H0269; they turned H5437 (8735) not when they went H3212 (8800); they went H3212 (8799) every one H0376 straight H5676 forward H6440.
001:010 As for the likeness H1823 of their faces H6440, they four H0702 had the face H6440 of a man H0120, and the face H6440 of a lion H0738, on the right side H3225: and they four H0702 had the face H6440 of an ox H7794 on the left side H8040; they four H0702 also had the face H6440 of an eagle H5404.
001:011 Thus [were] their faces H6440: and their wings H3671 [were] stretched H6504 (8803) upward H4605; two H8147 [wings] of every one H0376 [were] joined H2266 (8802) one H0376 to another H0376, and two H8147 covered H3680 (8764) their bodies H1472.
001:012 And they went H3212 (8799) every one H0376 straight H5676 forward H6440: whither the spirit H7307 was to go H3212 (8800), they went H3212 (8799); [and] they turned H5437 (8735) not when they went H3212 (8800).
001:013 As for the likeness H1823 of the living creatures H2416, their appearance H4758 [was] like burning H1197 (8802) coals H1513 of fire H0784, [and] like the appearance H4758 of lamps H3940: it went up and down H1980 (8693) among the living creatures H2416; and the fire H0784 was bright H5051, and out of the fire H0784 went forth H3318 (8802) lightning H1300.
001:014 And the living creatures H2416 ran H7519 (8800) and returned H7725 (8800) as the appearance H4758 of a flash of lightning H0965.
001:015 Now as I beheld H7200 (8799) the living creatures H2416, behold one H0259 wheel H0212 upon the earth H0776 by H0681 the living creatures H2416, with his four H0702 faces H6440.
001:016 The appearance H4758 of the wheels H0212 and their work H4639 [was] like unto the colour H5869 of a beryl H8658: and they four H0702 had one H0259 likeness H1823: and their appearance H4758 and their work H4639 [was] as it were a wheel H0212 in the middle H8432 of a wheel H0212.
001:017 When they went H3212 (8800), they went H3212 (8799) upon their four H0702 sides H7253: [and] they turned H5437 (8735) not when they went H3212 (8800).
001:018 As for their rings H1354, they were so high H1363 that they were dreadful H3374; and their rings H1354 [were] full H4392 of eyes H5869 round about H5439 them four H0702.
001:019 And when the living creatures H2416 went H3212 (8800), the wheels H0212 went H3212 (8799) by them H0681: and when the living creatures H2416 were lifted up H5375 (8736) from the earth H0776, the wheels H0212 were lifted up H5375 (8735).
001:020 Whithersoever the spirit H7307 was to go H3212 (8800), they went H3212 (8799), thither [was their] spirit H7307 to go H3212 (8800); and the wheels H0212 were lifted up H5375 (8735) over against H5980 them: for the spirit H7307 of the living creature H2416 [was] in the wheels H0212.
001:021 When those went H3212 (8800), [these] went H3212 (8799); and when those stood H5975 (8800), [these] stood H5975 (8799); and when those were lifted up H5375 (8736) from the earth H0776, the wheels H0212 were lifted up H5375 (8735) over against H5980 them: for the spirit H7307 of the living creature H2416 [was] in the wheels H0212.
001:022 And the likeness H1823 of the firmament H7549 upon the heads H7218 of the living creature H2416 [was] as the colour H5869 of the terrible H3372 (8737) crystal H7140, stretched forth H5186 (8803) over their heads H7218 above H4605.
001:023 And under the firmament H7549 [were] their wings H3671 straight H3477, the one H0802 toward the other H0269: every one H0376 had two H8147, which covered H3680 (8764) on this side H2007, and every one H0376 had two H8147, which covered H3680 (8764) on that side H2007, their bodies H1472.
001:024 And when they went H3212 (8800), I heard H8085 (8799) the noise H6963 of their wings H3671, like the noise H6963 of great H7227 waters H4325, as the voice H6963 of the Almighty H7706, the voice H6963 of speech H1999, as the noise H6963 of an host H4264: when they stood H5975 (8800), they let down H7503 (8762) their wings H3671.
001:025 And there was a voice H6963 from the firmament H7549 that [was] over their heads H7218, when they stood H5975 (8800), [and] had let down H7503 (8762) their wings H3671.
001:026 And above H4605 the firmament H7549 that [was] over their heads H7218 [was] the likeness H1823 of a throne H3678, as the appearance H4758 of a sapphire H5601 stone H0068: and upon the likeness H1823 of the throne H3678 [was] the likeness H1823 as the appearance H4758 of a man H0120 above H4605 upon it.
001:027 And I saw H7200 (8799) as the colour H5869 of amber H2830, as the appearance H4758 of fire H0784 round about H5439 within H1004 it, from the appearance H4758 of his loins H4975 even upward H4605, and from the appearance H4758 of his loins H4975 even downward H4295, I saw H7200 (8804) as it were the appearance H4758 of fire H0784, and it had brightness H5051 round about H5439.
001:028 As the appearance H4758 of the bow H7198 that is in the cloud H6051 in the day H3117 of rain H1653, so [was] the appearance H4758 of the brightness H5051 round about H5439. This [was] the appearance H4758 of the likeness H1823 of the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068. And when I saw H7200 (8799) [it], I fell H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440, and I heard H8085 (8799) a voice H6963 of one that spake H1696 (8764).
002:001 ¶ And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, stand H5975 (8798) upon thy feet H7272, and I will speak H1696 (8762) unto thee.
002:002 And the spirit H7307 entered H0935 (8799) into me when he spake H1696 (8765) unto me, and set H5975 (8686) me upon my feet H7272, that I heard H8085 (8799) him that spake H1696 (8693) unto me.
002:003 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, I send H7971 (8802) thee to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, to a rebellious H4775 (8802) nation H1471 that hath rebelled H4775 (8804) against me: they and their fathers H0001 have transgressed H6586 (8804) against me, [even] unto this very H6106 day H3117.
002:004 For [they are] impudent H7186 H6440 children H1121 and stiffhearted H2389 H3820. I do send H7971 (8802) thee unto them; and thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
002:005 And they, whether they will hear H8085 (8799), or whether they will forbear H2308 (8799), (for they [are] a rebellious H4805 house H1004,) yet shall know H3045 (8804) that there hath been a prophet H5030 among H8432 them.
002:006 And thou, son H1121 of man H0120, be not afraid H3372 (8799) of them, neither be afraid H3372 (8799) of their words H1697, though briers H5621 and thorns H5544 [be] with thee, and thou dost dwell H3427 (8802) among scorpions H6137: be not afraid H3372 (8799) of their words H1697, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735) at their looks H6440, though they [be] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
002:007 And thou shalt speak H1696 (8765) my words H1697 unto them, whether they will hear H8085 (8799), or whether they will forbear H2308 (8799): for they [are] most rebellious H4805.
002:008 But thou, son H1121 of man H0120, hear H8085 (8798) what I say H1696 (8764) unto thee; Be not H1961 (8799) thou rebellious H4805 like that rebellious H4805 house H1004: open H6475 (8798) thy mouth H6310, and eat H0398 (8798) that I give H5414 (8802) thee.
002:009 And when I looked H7200 (8799), behold, an hand H3027 [was] sent H7971 (8803) unto me; and, lo, a roll H4039 of a book H5612 [was] therein;
002:010 And he spread H6566 (8799) it before H6440 me; and it [was] written H3789 (8803) within H6440 and without H0268: and [there was] written H3789 (8803) therein lamentations H7015, and mourning H1899, and woe H1958.
003:001 ¶ Moreover he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, eat H0398 (8798) that thou findest H4672 (8799); eat H0398 (8798) this roll H4039, and go H3212 (8798) speak H1696 (8761) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
003:002 So I opened H6605 (8799) my mouth H6310, and he caused me to eat H0398 (8686) that roll H4039.
003:003 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, cause thy belly H0990 to eat H0398 (8686), and fill H4390 (8762) thy bowels H4578 with this roll H4039 that I give H5414 (8802) thee. Then did I eat H0398 (8799) [it]; and it was in my mouth H6310 as honey H1706 for sweetness H4966.
003:004 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, go H3212 (8798), get H0935 (8798) thee unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and speak H1696 (8765) with my words H1697 unto them.
003:005 For thou [art] not sent H7971 (8803) to a people H5971 of a strange H6012 speech H8193 and of an hard H3515 language H3956, [but] to the house H1004 of Israel H3478;
003:006 Not to many H7227 people H5971 of a strange H6012 speech H8193 and of an hard H3515 language H3956, whose words H1697 thou canst not understand H8085 (8799). Surely, had I sent H7971 (8804) thee to them, they would have hearkened H8085 (8799) unto thee.
003:007 But the house H1004 of Israel H3478 will H0014 (8799) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto thee; for they will H0014 (8802) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto me: for all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 [are] impudent H2389 H4696 and hardhearted H7186 H3820.
003:008 Behold, I have made H5414 (8804) thy face H6440 strong H2389 against H5980 their faces H6440, and thy forehead H4696 strong H2389 against H5980 their foreheads H4696.
003:009 As an adamant H8068 harder H2389 than flint H6864 have I made H5414 (8804) thy forehead H4696: fear H3372 (8799) them not, neither be dismayed H2865 (8735) at their looks H6440, though they [be] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
003:010 Moreover he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, all my words H1697 that I shall speak H1696 (8762) unto thee receive H3947 (8798) in thine heart H3824, and hear H8085 (8798) with thine ears H0241.
003:011 And go H3212 (8798), get H0935 (8798) thee to them of the captivity H1473, unto the children H1121 of thy people H5971, and speak H1696 (8765) unto them, and tell H0559 (8804) them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; whether they will hear H8085 (8799), or whether they will forbear H2308 (8799).
003:012 Then the spirit H7307 took me up H5375 (8799), and I heard H8085 (8799) behind H0310 me a voice H6963 of a great H1419 rushing H7494, [saying], Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 from his place H4725.
003:013 [I heard] also the noise H6963 of the wings H3671 of the living creatures H2416 that touched H5401 (8688) one H0802 another H0269, and the noise H6963 of the wheels H0212 over against H5980 them, and a noise H6963 of a great H1419 rushing H7494.
003:014 So the spirit H7307 lifted me up H5375 (8804), and took me away H3947 (8799), and I went H3212 (8799) in bitterness H4751, in the heat H2534 of my spirit H7307; but the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was strong H2388 (8804) upon me.
003:015 Then I came H0935 (8799) to them of the captivity H1473 at Telabib H8512, that dwelt H3427 (8802) by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529, and I sat H3427 (8799) where they sat H3427 (8799), and remained H3427 (8799) there astonished H8074 (8688) among H8432 them seven H7651 days H3117.
003:016 And it came to pass at the end H7097 of seven H7651 days H3117, that the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
003:017 Son H1121 of man H0120, I have made H5414 (8804) thee a watchman H6822 (8802) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478: therefore hear H8085 (8804) the word H1697 at my mouth H6310, and give them warning H2094 (8689) from me.
003:018 When I say H0559 (8800) unto the wicked H7563, Thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799); and thou givest him not warning H2094 (8689), nor speakest H1696 (8765) to warn H2094 (8687) the wicked H7563 from his wicked H7563 way H1870, to save his life H2421 (8763); the same wicked H7563 [man] shall die H4191 (8799) in his iniquity H5771; but his blood H1818 will I require H1245 (8762) at thine hand H3027.
003:019 Yet if thou warn H2094 (8689) the wicked H7563, and he turn H7725 (8804) not from his wickedness H7562, nor from his wicked H7563 way H1870, he shall die H4191 (8799) in his iniquity H5771; but thou hast delivered H5337 (8689) thy soul H5315.
003:020 Again H7725, When a righteous H6662 [man] doth turn H7725 (8800) from his righteousness H6664, and commit H6213 (8804) iniquity H5766, and I lay H5414 (8804) a stumblingblock H4383 before H6440 him, he shall die H4191 (8799): because thou hast not given him warning H2094 (8689), he shall die H4191 (8799) in his sin H2403, and his righteousness H6666 which he hath done H6213 (8804) shall not be remembered H2142 (8735); but his blood H1818 will I require H1245 (8762) at thine hand H3027.
003:021 Nevertheless if thou warn H2094 (8689) the righteous H6662 [man], that the righteous H6662 sin H2398 (8800) not, and he doth not sin H2398 (8804), he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799), because he is warned H2094 (8737); also thou hast delivered H5337 (8689) thy soul H5315.
003:022 And the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was there upon me; and he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Arise H6965 (8798), go forth H3318 (8798) into the plain H1237, and I will there talk H1696 (8762) with thee.
003:023 Then I arose H6965 (8799), and went forth H3318 (8799) into the plain H1237: and, behold, the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 stood H5975 (8802) there, as the glory H3519 which I saw H7200 (8804) by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529: and I fell H5307 (8799) on my face H6440.
003:024 Then the spirit H7307 entered H0935 (8799) into me, and set H5975 (8686) me upon my feet H7272, and spake H1696 (8762) with me, and said H0559 (8799) unto me, Go H0935 (8798), shut H5462 (8734) thyself within H8432 thine house H1004.
003:025 But thou, O son H1121 of man H0120, behold, they shall put H5414 (8804) bands H5688 upon thee, and shall bind H0631 (8804) thee with them, and thou shalt not go out H3318 (8799) among H8432 them:
003:026 And I will make thy tongue H3956 cleave H1692 (8686) to the roof of thy mouth H2441, that thou shalt be dumb H0481 (8738), and shalt not be to them a reprover H0376 H3198 (8688): for they [are] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
003:027 But when I speak H1696 (8763) with H0854 thee, I will open H6605 (8799) thy mouth H6310, and thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; He that heareth H8085 (8802), let him hear H8085 (8799); and he that forbeareth H2310, let him forbear H2308 (8799): for they [are] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
004:001 ¶ Thou also, son H1121 of man H0120, take H3947 (8798) thee a tile H3843, and lay H5414 (8804) it before H6440 thee, and pourtray H2710 (8804) upon it the city H5892, [even] Jerusalem H3389:
004:002 And lay H5414 (8804) siege H4692 against it, and build H1129 (8804) a fort H1785 against it, and cast H8210 (8804) a mount H5550 against it; set H5414 (8804) the camp H4264 also against it, and set H7760 (8798) [battering] rams H3733 against it round about H5439.
004:003 Moreover take H3947 (8798) thou unto thee an iron H1270 pan H4227, and set H5414 (8804) it [for] a wall H7023 of iron H1270 between thee and the city H5892: and set H3559 (8689) thy face H6440 against it, and it shall be besieged H4692, and thou shalt lay siege H6696 (8804) against it. This [shall be] a sign H0226 to the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
004:004 Lie H7901 (8798) thou also upon thy left H8042 side H6654, and lay H7760 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 upon it: [according] to the number H4557 of the days H3117 that thou shalt lie H7901 (8799) upon it thou shalt bear H5375 (8799) their iniquity H5771.
004:005 For I have laid H5414 (8804) upon thee the years H8141 of their iniquity H5771, according to the number H4557 of the days H3117, three H7969 hundred H3967 and ninety H8673 days H3117: so shalt thou bear H5375 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
004:006 And when thou hast accomplished H3615 (8765) them H0428, lie H7901 (8804) again H8145 on thy right H3233 (8675) H3227 side H6654, and thou shalt bear H5375 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of the house H1004 of Judah H3063 forty H0705 days H3117: I have appointed H5414 (8804) thee each day H3117 H3117 for a year H8141 H8141.
004:007 Therefore thou shalt set H3559 (8686) thy face H6440 toward the siege H4692 of Jerusalem H3389, and thine arm H2220 [shall be] uncovered H2834 (8803), and thou shalt prophesy H5012 (8738) against it.
004:008 And, behold, I will lay H5414 (8804) bands H5688 upon thee, and thou shalt not turn H2015 (8735) thee from one side H6654 to another H6654, till thou hast ended H3615 (8763) the days H3117 of thy siege H4692.
004:009 Take H3947 (8798) thou also unto thee wheat H2406, and barley H8184, and beans H6321, and lentiles H5742, and millet H1764, and fitches H3698, and put H5414 (8804) them in one H0259 vessel H3627, and make H6213 (8804) thee bread H3899 thereof, [according] to the number H4557 of the days H3117 that thou shalt lie H7901 (8802) upon thy side H6654, three H7969 hundred H3967 and ninety H8673 days H3117 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) thereof.
004:010 And thy meat H3978 which thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) [shall be] by weight H4946, twenty H6242 shekels H8255 a day H3117: from time H6256 to time H6256 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) it.
004:011 Thou shalt drink H8354 (8799) also water H4325 by measure H4884, the sixth part H8345 of an hin H1969: from time H6256 to time H6256 shalt thou drink H8354 (8799).
004:012 And thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) it [as] barley H8184 cakes H5692, and thou shalt bake H5746 (8799) it with dung H1561 that cometh out H6627 of man H0120, in their sight H5869.
004:013 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Even thus shall the children H1121 of Israel H3478 eat H0398 (8799) their defiled H2931 bread H3899 among the Gentiles H1471, whither I will drive H5080 (8686) them.
004:014 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Ah H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069! behold, my soul H5315 hath not been polluted H2930 (8794): for from my youth H5271 up even till now have I not eaten H0398 (8804) of that which dieth of itself H5038, or is torn in pieces H2966; neither came H0935 (8804) there abominable H6292 flesh H1320 into my mouth H6310.
004:015 Then he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Lo H7200 (8798), I have given H5414 (8804) thee cow’s H1241 dung H6832 (8675) H6832 for man’s H0120 dung H1561, and thou shalt prepare H6213 (8804) thy bread H3899 therewith.
004:016 Moreover he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, behold, I will break H7665 (8799) the staff H4294 of bread H3899 in Jerusalem H3389: and they shall eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899 by weight H4948, and with care H1674; and they shall drink H8354 (8799) water H4325 by measure H4884, and with astonishment H8078:
004:017 That they may want H2637 (8799) bread H3899 and water H4325, and be astonied H8074 (8738) one H0376 with another H0251, and consume away H4743 (8738) for their iniquity H5771.
005:001 ¶ And thou, son H1121 of man H0120, take H3947 (8798) thee a sharp H2299 knife H2719, take H3947 (8799) thee a barber’s H1532 razor H8593, and cause [it] to pass H5674 (8689) upon thine head H7218 and upon thy beard H2206: then take H3947 (8804) thee balances H3976 to weigh H4948, and divide H2505 (8765) the [hair].
005:002 Thou shalt burn H1197 (8686) with fire H0217 a third part H7992 in the midst H8432 of the city H5892, when the days H3117 of the siege H4692 are fulfilled H4390 (8800): and thou shalt take H3947 (8804) a third part H7992, [and] smite H5221 (8686) about H5439 it with a knife H2719: and a third part H7992 thou shalt scatter H2219 (8799) in the wind H7307; and I will draw out H7324 (8686) a sword H2719 after H0310 them.
005:003 Thou shalt also take H3947 (8804) thereof a few H4592 in number H4557, and bind H6696 (8804) them in thy skirts H3671.
005:004 Then take of them again H3947 (8799), and cast H7993 (8689) them into the midst H8432 of the fire H0784, and burn H8313 (8804) them in the fire H0784; [for] thereof shall a fire H0784 come forth H3318 (8799) into all the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
005:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; This [is] Jerusalem H3389: I have set H7760 (8804) it in the midst H8432 of the nations H1471 and countries H0776 [that are] round about H5439 her.
005:006 And she hath changed H4784 (8686) my judgments H4941 into wickedness H7564 more than the nations H1471, and my statutes H2708 more than the countries H0776 that [are] round about H5439 her: for they have refused H3988 (8804) my judgments H4941 and my statutes H2708, they have not walked H1980 (8804) in them.
005:007 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because ye multiplied H1995 (8800) more than the nations H1471 that [are] round about H5439 you, [and] have not walked H1980 (8804) in my statutes H2708, neither have kept H6213 (8804) my judgments H4941, neither have done H6213 (8804) according to the judgments H4941 of the nations H1471 that [are] round about H5439 you;
005:008 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I, even I, [am] against thee, and will execute H6213 (8804) judgments H4941 in the midst H8432 of thee in the sight H5869 of the nations H1471.
005:009 And I will do H6213 (8804) in thee that which I have not done H6213 (8804), and whereunto I will not do H6213 (8799) any more the like, because H3282 of all thine abominations H8441.
005:010 Therefore the fathers H0001 shall eat H0398 (8799) the sons H1121 in the midst H8432 of thee, and the sons H1121 shall eat H0398 (8799) their fathers H0001; and I will execute H6213 (8804) judgments H8201 in thee, and the whole remnant H7611 of thee will I scatter H2219 (8765) into all the winds H7307.
005:011 Wherefore, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Surely, because thou hast defiled H2930 (8765) my sanctuary H4720 with all thy detestable things H8251, and with all thine abominations H8441, therefore will I also diminish H1639 (8799) [thee]; neither shall mine eye H5869 spare H2347 (8799), neither will I have any pity H2550 (8799).
005:012 A third part H7992 of thee shall die H4191 (8799) with the pestilence H1698, and with famine H7458 shall they be consumed H3615 (8799) in the midst H8432 of thee: and a third part H7992 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719 round about H5439 thee; and I will scatter H2219 (8762) a third part H7992 into all the winds H7307, and I will draw out H7324 (8686) a sword H2719 after H0310 them.
005:013 Thus shall mine anger H0639 be accomplished H3615 (8804), and I will cause my fury H2534 to rest H5117 (8689) upon them, and I will be comforted H5162 (8694): and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it] in my zeal H7068, when I have accomplished H3615 (8763) my fury H2534 in them.
005:014 Moreover I will make H5414 (8799) thee waste H2723, and a reproach H2781 among the nations H1471 that [are] round about H5439 thee, in the sight H5869 of all that pass by H5674 (8802).
005:015 So it shall be a reproach H2781 and a taunt H1422, an instruction H4148 and an astonishment H4923 unto the nations H1471 that [are] round about H5439 thee, when I shall execute H6213 (8800) judgments H8201 in thee in anger H0639 and in fury H2534 and in furious H2534 rebukes H8433. I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
005:016 When I shall send H7971 (8762) upon them the evil H7451 arrows H2671 of famine H7458, which shall be for [their] destruction H4889, [and] which I will send H7971 (8763) to destroy H7843 (8763) you: and I will increase H3254 (8686) the famine H7458 upon you, and will break H7665 (8804) your staff H4294 of bread H3899:
005:017 So will I send H7971 (8765) upon you famine H7458 and evil H7451 beasts H2416, and they shall bereave H7921 (8765) thee; and pestilence H1698 and blood H1818 shall pass through H5674 (8799) thee; and I will bring H0935 (8686) the sword H2719 upon thee. I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
006:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
006:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 toward the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against them,
006:003 And say H0559 (8804), Ye mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 to the mountains H2022, and to the hills H1389, to the rivers H0650, and to the valleys H1516; Behold, I, [even] I, will bring H0935 (8688) a sword H2719 upon you, and I will destroy H0006 (8765) your high places H1116.
006:004 And your altars H4196 shall be desolate H8074 (8738), and your images H2553 shall be broken H7665 (8738): and I will cast down H5307 (8689) your slain H2491 [men] before H6440 your idols H1544.
006:005 And I will lay H5414 (8804) the dead carcases H6297 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 before H6440 their idols H1544; and I will scatter H2219 (8765) your bones H6106 round about H5439 your altars H4196.
006:006 In all your dwellingplaces H4186 the cities H5892 shall be laid waste H2717 (8799), and the high places H1116 shall be desolate H3456 (8799); that your altars H4196 may be laid waste H2717 (8799) and made desolate H0816 (8799), and your idols H1544 may be broken H7665 (8738) and cease H7673 (8738), and your images H2553 may be cut down H1438 (8738), and your works H4639 may be abolished H4229 (8738).
006:007 And the slain H2491 shall fall H5307 (8804) in the midst H8432 of you, and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant H3498 (8689), that ye may have [some] that shall escape H6412 the sword H2719 among the nations H1471, when ye shall be scattered H2219 (8736) through the countries H0776.
006:009 And they that escape H6412 of you shall remember H2142 (8804) me among the nations H1471 whither they shall be carried captives H7617 (8738), because I am broken H7665 (8738) with their whorish H2181 (8802) heart H3820, which hath departed H5493 (8804) from me, and with their eyes H5869, which go a whoring H2181 (8802) after H0310 their idols H1544: and they shall lothe H6962 (8738) themselves H6440 for the evils H7451 which they have committed H6213 (8804) in all their abominations H8441.
006:010 And they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, [and that] I have not said H1696 (8765) in vain H2600 that I would do H6213 (8800) this evil H7451 unto them.
006:011 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Smite H5221 (8685) with thine hand H3709, and stamp H7554 (8798) with thy foot H7272, and say H0559 (8798), Alas H0253 for all the evil H7451 abominations H8441 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478! for they shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698.
006:012 He that is far off H7350 shall die H4191 (8799) of the pestilence H1698; and he that is near H7138 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719; and he that remaineth H7604 (8737) and is besieged H5341 (8803) shall die H4191 (8799) by the famine H7458: thus will I accomplish H3615 (8765) my fury H2534 upon them.
006:013 Then shall ye know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when their slain H2491 [men] shall be among H8432 their idols H1544 round about H5439 their altars H4196, upon every high H7311 (8802) hill H1389, in all the tops H7218 of the mountains H2022, and under every green H7488 tree H6086, and under every thick H5687 oak H0424, the place H4725 where they did offer H5414 (8804) sweet H5207 savour H7381 to all their idols H1544.
006:014 So will I stretch out H5186 (8804) my hand H3027 upon them, and make H5414 (8804) the land H0776 desolate H8077, yea, more desolate H4923 than the wilderness H4057 toward Diblath H1689, in all their habitations H4186: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
007:001 ¶ Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
007:002 Also, thou son H1121 of man H0120, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 unto the land H0127 of Israel H3478; An end H7093, the end H7093 is come H0935 (8804) upon the four H0702 corners H3671 of the land H0776.
007:003 Now [is] the end H7093 [come] upon thee, and I will send H7971 (8765) mine anger H0639 upon thee, and will judge H8199 (8804) thee according to thy ways H1870, and will recompense H5414 (8804) upon thee all thine abominations H8441.
007:004 And mine eye H5869 shall not spare H2347 (8799) thee, neither will I have pity H2550 (8799): but I will recompense H5414 (8799) thy ways H1870 upon thee, and thine abominations H8441 shall be in the midst H8432 of thee: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
007:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; An evil H7451, an only H0259 evil H7451, behold, is come H0935 (8802).
007:006 An end H7093 is come H0935 (8804), the end H7093 is come H0935 (8804): it watcheth H6974 (8689) for thee; behold, it is come H0935 (8802).
007:007 The morning H6843 is come H0935 (8804) unto thee, O thou that dwellest H3427 (8802) in the land H0776: the time H6256 is come H0935 (8804) (8676) H0935 (8802), the day H3117 of trouble H4103 [is] near H7138, and not the sounding again H1906 of the mountains H2022.
007:008 Now will I shortly H7138 pour out H8210 (8799) my fury H2534 upon thee, and accomplish H3615 (8765) mine anger H0639 upon thee: and I will judge H8199 (8804) thee according to thy ways H1870, and will recompense H5414 (8804) thee for all thine abominations H8441.
007:009 And mine eye H5869 shall not spare H2347 (8799), neither will I have pity H2550 (8799): I will recompense H5414 (8799) thee according to thy ways H1870 and thine abominations H8441 [that] are in the midst H8432 of thee; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068 that smiteth H5221 (8688).
007:010 Behold the day H3117, behold, it is come H0935 (8802): the morning H6843 is gone forth H3318 (8804); the rod H4294 hath blossomed H6692 (8804), pride H2087 hath budded H6524 (8804).
007:011 Violence H2555 is risen up H6965 (8804) into a rod H4294 of wickedness H7562: none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude H1995, nor of any H1991 of theirs: neither [shall there be] wailing H5089 for them.
007:012 The time H6256 is come H0935 (8804), the day H3117 draweth near H5060 (8689): let not the buyer H7069 (8802) rejoice H8055 (8799), nor the seller H4376 (8802) mourn H0056 (8691): for wrath H2740 [is] upon all the multitude H1995 thereof.
007:013 For the seller H4376 (8802) shall not return H7725 (8799) to that which is sold H4465, although they were yet alive H2416: for the vision H2377 [is] touching the whole multitude H1995 thereof, [which] shall not return H7725 (8799); neither shall any H0376 strengthen H2388 (8691) himself in the iniquity H5771 of his life H2416.
007:014 They have blown H8628 (8804) the trumpet H8619, even to make all ready H3559 (8687); but none goeth H1980 (8802) to the battle H4421: for my wrath H2740 [is] upon all the multitude H1995 thereof.
007:015 The sword H2719 [is] without H2351, and the pestilence H1698 and the famine H7458 within H1004: he that [is] in the field H7704 shall die H4191 (8799) with the sword H2719; and he that [is] in the city H5892, famine H7458 and pestilence H1698 shall devour H0398 (8799) him.
007:016 But they that escape H6403 (8804) of them shall escape H6412, and shall be on the mountains H2022 like doves H3123 of the valleys H1516, all of them mourning H1993 (8802), every one H0376 for his iniquity H5771.
007:017 All hands H3027 shall be feeble H7503 (8799), and all knees H1290 shall be weak H3212 (8799) [as] water H4325.
007:018 They shall also gird H2296 (8804) [themselves] with sackcloth H8242, and horror H6427 shall cover H3680 (8765) them; and shame H0955 [shall be] upon all faces H6440, and baldness H7144 upon all their heads H7218.
007:019 They shall cast H7993 (8686) their silver H3701 in the streets H2351, and their gold H2091 shall be removed H5079: their silver H3701 and their gold H2091 shall not be able H3201 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8687) them in the day H3117 of the wrath H5678 of the LORD H3068: they shall not satisfy H7646 (8762) their souls H5315, neither fill H4390 (8762) their bowels H4578: because it is the stumblingblock H4383 of their iniquity H5771.
007:020 As for the beauty H6643 of his ornament H5716, he set H7760 (8804) it in majesty H1347: but they made H6213 (8804) the images H6754 of their abominations H8441 [and] of their detestable things H8251 therein: therefore have I set H5414 (8804) it far H5079 from them.
007:021 And I will give H5414 (8804) it into the hands H3027 of the strangers H2114 (8801) for a prey H0957, and to the wicked H7563 of the earth H0776 for a spoil H7998; and they shall pollute H2490 (8765) it.
007:022 My face H6440 will I turn H5437 (8689) also from them, and they shall pollute H2490 (8765) my secret H6845 (8803) [place]: for the robbers H6530 shall enter H0935 (8804) into it, and defile H2490 (8765) it.
007:023 Make H6213 (8798) a chain H7569: for the land H0776 is full H4390 (8804) of bloody H1818 crimes H4941, and the city H5892 is full H4390 (8804) of violence H2555.
007:024 Wherefore I will bring H0935 (8689) the worst H7451 of the heathen H1471, and they shall possess H3423 (8804) their houses H1004: I will also make the pomp H1347 of the strong H5794 to cease H7673 (8689); and their holy places H6942 (8764) shall be defiled H2490 (8738) (8676) H5157 (8765).
007:025 Destruction H7089 cometh H0935 (8804); and they shall seek H1245 (8765) peace H7965, and [there shall be] none.
007:026 Mischief H1943 shall come H0935 (8799) upon mischief H1943, and rumour H8052 shall be upon rumour H8052; then shall they seek H1245 (8765) a vision H2377 of the prophet H5030; but the law H8451 shall perish H0006 (8799) from the priest H3548, and counsel H6098 from the ancients H2205.
007:027 The king H4428 shall mourn H0056 (8691), and the prince H5387 shall be clothed H3847 (8799) with desolation H8077, and the hands H3027 of the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall be troubled H0926 (8735): I will do H6213 (8799) unto them after their way H1870, and according to their deserts H4941 will I judge H8199 (8799) them; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
008:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the sixth H8345 year H8141, in the sixth H8345 [month], in the fifth H2568 [day] of the month H2320, [as] I sat H3427 (8802) in mine house H1004, and the elders H2205 of Judah H3063 sat H3427 (8802) before H6440 me, that the hand H3027 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 fell H5307 (8799) there upon me.
008:002 Then I beheld H7200 (8799), and lo a likeness H1823 as the appearance H4758 of fire H0784: from the appearance H4758 of his loins H4975 even downward H4295, fire H0784; and from his loins H4975 even upward H4605, as the appearance H4758 of brightness H2096, as the colour H5869 of amber H2830.
008:003 And he put forth H7971 (8799) the form H8403 of an hand H3027, and took H3947 (8799) me by a lock H6734 of mine head H7218; and the spirit H7307 lifted me up H5375 (8799) between the earth H0776 and the heaven H8064, and brought H0935 (8686) me in the visions H4759 of God H0430 to Jerusalem H3389, to the door H6607 of the inner H6442 gate H8179 that looketh H6437 (8802) toward the north H6828; where [was] the seat H4186 of the image H5566 of jealousy H7068, which provoketh to jealousy H7069 (8688).
008:004 And, behold, the glory H3519 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 [was] there, according to the vision H4758 that I saw H7200 (8804) in the plain H1237.
008:005 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, lift up H5375 (8798) thine eyes H5869 now the way H1870 toward the north H6828. So I lifted up H5375 (8799) mine eyes H5869 the way H1870 toward the north H6828, and behold northward H6828 at the gate H8179 of the altar H4196 this image H5566 of jealousy H7068 in the entry H0872.
008:006 He said H0559 (8799) furthermore unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, seest H7200 (8802) thou what they do H6213 (8802)? [even] the great H1419 abominations H8441 that the house H1004 of Israel H3478 committeth H6213 (8802) here, that I should go far off H7368 (8800) from my sanctuary H4720? but turn H7725 (8799) thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see H7200 (8799) greater H1419 abominations H8441.
008:007 And he brought H0935 (8686) me to the door H6607 of the court H2691; and when I looked H7200 (8799), behold a H0259 hole H2356 in the wall H7023.
008:008 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, dig H2864 (8798) now in the wall H7023: and when I had digged H2864 (8799) in the wall H7023, behold a H0259 door H6607.
008:009 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Go in H0935 (8798), and behold H7200 (8798) the wicked H7451 abominations H8441 that they do H6213 (8802) here.
008:010 So I went in H0935 (8799) and saw H7200 (8799); and behold every form H8403 of creeping things H7431, and abominable H8263 beasts H0929, and all the idols H1544 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, pourtrayed H2707 (8794) upon the wall H7023 round about H5439.
008:011 And there stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 them seventy H7657 men H0376 of the ancients H2205 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and in the midst H8432 of them stood H5975 (8802) Jaazaniah H2970 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, with every man H0376 his censer H4730 in his hand H3027; and a thick H6282 cloud H6051 of incense H7004 went up H5927 (8802).
008:012 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, hast thou seen H7200 (8804) what the ancients H2205 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 do H6213 (8802) in the dark H2822, every man H0376 in the chambers H2315 of his imagery H4906? for they say H0559 (8802), The LORD H3068 seeth H7200 (8802) us not; the LORD H3068 hath forsaken H5800 (8804) the earth H0776.
008:013 He said H0559 (8799) also unto me, Turn H7725 (8799) thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see H7200 (8799) greater H1419 abominations H8441 that they do H6213 (8802).
008:014 Then he brought H0935 (8686) me to the door H6607 of the gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004 which [was] toward the north H6828; and, behold, there sat H3427 (8802) women H0802 weeping H1058 (8764) for Tammuz H8542.
008:015 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Hast thou seen H7200 (8804) [this], O son H1121 of man H0120? turn H7725 (8799) thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see H7200 (8799) greater H1419 abominations H8441 than these.
008:016 And he brought H0935 (8686) me into the inner H6442 court H2691 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, and, behold, at the door H6607 of the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, between the porch H0197 and the altar H4196, [were] about five H2568 and twenty H6242 men H0376, with their backs H0268 toward the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, and their faces H6440 toward the east H6924; and they worshipped H7812 (8693) the sun H8121 toward the east H6924.
008:017 Then he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Hast thou seen H7200 (8804) [this], O son H1121 of man H0120? Is it a light thing H7043 (8738) to the house H1004 of Judah H3063 that they commit H6213 (8800) the abominations H8441 which they commit H6213 (8804) here? for they have filled H4390 (8804) the land H0776 with violence H2555, and have returned H7725 (8799) to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687): and, lo, they put H7971 (8802) the branch H2156 to their nose H0639.
008:018 Therefore will I also deal H6213 (8799) in fury H2534: mine eye H5869 shall not spare H2347 (8799), neither will I have pity H2550 (8799): and though they cry H7121 (8804) in mine ears H0241 with a loud H1419 voice H6963, [yet] will I not hear H8085 (8799) them.
009:001 ¶ He cried H7121 (8799) also in mine ears H0241 with a loud H1419 voice H6963, saying H0559 (8800), Cause them that have charge H6486 over the city H5892 to draw near H7126 (8804), even every man H0376 [with] his destroying H4892 weapon H3627 in his hand H3027.
009:002 And, behold, six H8337 men H0582 came H0935 (8802) from the way H1870 of the higher H5945 gate H8179, which lieth H6437 (8716) toward the north H6828, and every man H0376 a slaughter H4660 weapon H3627 in his hand H3027; and one H0259 man H0376 among H8432 them [was] clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906, with a writer’s H5608 (8802) inkhorn H7083 by his side H4975: and they went in H0935 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) beside H0681 the brasen H5178 altar H4196.
009:003 And the glory H3519 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 was gone up H5927 (8738) from the cherub H3742, whereupon he was, to the threshold H4670 of the house H1004. And he called H7121 (8799) to the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906, which [had] the writer’s H5608 (8802) inkhorn H7083 by his side H4975;
009:004 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go through H5674 (8798) the midst H8432 of the city H5892, through the midst H8432 of Jerusalem H3389, and set H8427 (8689) a mark H8420 upon the foreheads H4696 of the men H0582 that sigh H0584 (8737) and that cry H0602 (8737) for all the abominations H8441 that be done H6213 (8737) in the midst H8432 thereof.
009:005 And to the others H0428 he said H0559 (8804) in mine hearing H0241, Go H5674 (8798) ye after H0310 him through the city H5892, and smite H5221 (8685): let not your eye H5869 spare H2347 (8799), neither have ye pity H2550 (8799):
009:006 Slay H2026 (8799) utterly H4889 old H2205 [and] young H0970, both maids H1330, and little children H2945, and women H0802: but come not near H5066 (8799) any man H0376 upon whom [is] the mark H8420; and begin H2490 (8686) at my sanctuary H4720. Then they began H2490 (8686) at the ancient H2205 men H0582 which [were] before H6440 the house H1004.
009:007 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Defile H2930 (8761) the house H1004, and fill H4390 (8761) the courts H2691 with the slain H2491: go ye forth H3318 (8798). And they went forth H3318 (8804), and slew H5221 (8689) in the city H5892.
009:008 And it came to pass, while they were slaying H5221 (8687) them, and I was left H7604 (8737), that I fell H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440, and cried H2199 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Ah H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069! wilt thou destroy H7843 (8688) all the residue H7611 of Israel H3478 in thy pouring out H8210 (8800) of thy fury H2534 upon Jerusalem H3389?
009:009 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, The iniquity H5771 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063 [is] exceeding H3966 H3966 great H1419, and the land H0776 is full H4390 (8735) of blood H1818, and the city H5892 full H4390 (8804) of perverseness H4297: for they say H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 hath forsaken H5800 (8804) the earth H0776, and the LORD H3068 seeth H7200 (8802) not.
009:010 And as for me also, mine eye H5869 shall not spare H2347 (8799), neither will I have pity H2550 (8799), [but] I will recompense H5414 (8804) their way H1870 upon their head H7218.
009:011 And, behold, the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906, which [had] the inkhorn H7083 by his side H4975, reported H7725 (8688) the matter H1697, saying H0559 (8800), I have done H6213 (8804) as thou hast commanded H6680 (8765) me.
010:001 ¶ Then I looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, in the firmament H7549 that was above the head H7218 of the cherubims H3742 there appeared H7200 (8738) over them as it were a sapphire H5601 stone H0068, as the appearance H4758 of the likeness H1823 of a throne H3678.
010:002 And he spake H0559 (8799) unto the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906, and said H0559 (8799), Go in H0935 (8798) between H0996 the wheels H1534, [even] under the cherub H3742, and fill H4390 (8761) thine hand H2651 with coals H1513 of fire H0784 from between H0996 the cherubims H3742, and scatter H2236 (8798) [them] over the city H5892. And he went in H0935 (8799) in my sight H5869.
010:003 Now the cherubims H3742 stood H5975 (8802) on the right side H3225 of the house H1004, when the man H0376 went in H0935 (8800); and the cloud H6051 filled H4390 (8804) the inner H6442 court H2691.
010:004 Then the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 went up H7311 (8799) from the cherub H3742, [and stood] over the threshold H4670 of the house H1004; and the house H1004 was filled H4390 (8735) with the cloud H6051, and the court H2691 was full H4390 (8804) of the brightness H5051 of the LORD’S H3068 glory H3519.
010:005 And the sound H6963 of the cherubims H3742 ’ wings H3671 was heard H8085 (8738) [even] to the outer H2435 court H2691, as the voice H6963 of the Almighty H7706 God H0410 when he speaketh H1696 (8763).
010:006 And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded H6680 (8763) the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906, saying H0559 (8800), Take H3947 (8798) fire H0784 from between the wheels H1534, from between the cherubims H3742; then he went in H0935 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) beside H0681 the wheels H0212.
010:007 And [one] cherub H3742 stretched forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027 from between the cherubims H3742 unto the fire H0784 that [was] between the cherubims H3742, and took H5375 (8799) [thereof], and put H5414 (8799) [it] into the hands H2651 of [him that was] clothed H3847 (8803) with linen H0906: who took H3947 (8799) [it], and went out H3318 (8799).
010:008 And there appeared H7200 (8735) in the cherubims H3742 the form H8403 of a man’s H0120 hand H3027 under their wings H3671.
010:009 And when I looked H7200 (8799), behold the four H0702 wheels H0212 by H0681 the cherubims H3742, one H0259 wheel H0212 by H0681 one H0259 cherub H3742, and another H0259 wheel H0212 by H0681 another H0259 cherub H3742: and the appearance H4758 of the wheels H0212 [was] as the colour H5869 of a beryl H8658 stone H0068.
010:010 And [as for] their appearances H4758, they four H0702 had one H0259 likeness H1823, as if a wheel H0212 had been in the midst H8432 of a wheel H0212.
010:011 When they went H3212 (8800), they went H3212 (8800) upon their four H0702 sides H7253; they turned H5437 (8735) not as they went H3212 (8800), but to the place H4725 whither the head H7218 looked H6437 (8799) they followed H3212 (8799) H0310 it; they turned H5437 (8735) not as they went H3212 (8799).
010:012 And their whole body H1320, and their backs H1354, and their hands H3027, and their wings H3671, and the wheels H0212, [were] full H4392 of eyes H5869 round about H5439, [even] the wheels H0212 that they four H0702 had.
010:013 As for the wheels H0212, it was cried H7121 (8795) unto them in my hearing H0241, O wheel H1534.
010:014 And every one H0259 had four H0702 faces H6440: the first H0259 face H6440 [was] the face H6440 of a cherub H3742, and the second H8145 face H6440 [was] the face H6440 of a man H0120, and the third H7992 the face H6440 of a lion H0738, and the fourth H7243 the face H6440 of an eagle H5404.
010:015 And the cherubims H3742 were lifted up H7426 (8735). This [is] the living creature H2416 that I saw H7200 (8804) by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529.
010:016 And when the cherubims H3742 went H3212 (8800), the wheels H0212 went H3212 (8799) by them H0681: and when the cherubims H3742 lifted up H5375 (8800) their wings H3671 to mount up H7311 (8800) from the earth H0776, the same wheels H0212 also H1992 turned H5437 (8735) not from beside H0681 them.
010:017 When they stood H5975 (8800), [these] stood H5975 (8799); and when they were lifted up H7311 (8800), [these] lifted up H7426 (8735) themselves [also]: for the spirit H7307 of the living creature H2416 [was] in them.
010:018 Then the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 departed H3318 (8799) from off the threshold H4670 of the house H1004, and stood H5975 (8799) over the cherubims H3742.
010:019 And the cherubims H3742 lifted up H5375 (8799) their wings H3671, and mounted up H7426 (8735) from the earth H0776 in my sight H5869: when they went out H3318 (8800), the wheels H0212 also [were] beside H5980 them, and [every one] stood H5975 (8799) at the door H6607 of the east H6931 gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004; and the glory H3519 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 [was] over them above H4605.
010:020 This [is] the living creature H2416 that I saw H7200 (8804) under the God H0430 of Israel H3478 by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529; and I knew H3045 (8799) that they [were] the cherubims H3742.
010:021 Every one H0259 had four H0702 faces H6440 apiece H0259, and every one H0259 four H0702 wings H3671; and the likeness H1823 of the hands H3027 of a man H0120 [was] under their wings H3671.
010:022 And the likeness H1823 of their faces H6440 [was] the same H1992 faces H6440 which I saw H7200 (8804) by the river H5104 of Chebar H3529, their appearances H4758 and themselves: they went H3212 (8799) every one H0376 straight H5676 forward H6440.
011:001 ¶ Moreover the spirit H7307 lifted me up H5375 (8799), and brought H0935 (8686) me unto the east H6931 gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, which looketh H6437 (8802) eastward H6921: and behold at the door H6607 of the gate H8179 five H2568 and twenty H6242 men H0376; among H8432 whom I saw H7200 (8799) Jaazaniah H2970 the son H1121 of Azur H5809, and Pelatiah H6410 the son H1121 of Benaiah H1141, princes H8269 of the people H5971.
011:002 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, these [are] the men H0582 that devise H2803 (8802) mischief H0205, and give H3289 (8802) wicked H7451 counsel H6098 in this city H5892:
011:003 Which say H0559 (8802), [It is] not near H7138; let us build H1129 (8800) houses H1004: this [city is] the caldron H5518, and we [be] the flesh H1320.
011:004 Therefore prophesy H5012 (8734) against them, prophesy H5012 (8734), O son H1121 of man H0120.
011:005 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 fell H5307 (8799) upon me, and said H0559 (8799) unto me, Speak H0559 (8798); Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Thus have ye said H0559 (8799), O house H1004 of Israel H3478: for I know H3045 (8804) the things that come H4609 into your mind H7307, [every one of] them.
011:006 Ye have multiplied H7235 (8689) your slain H2491 in this city H5892, and ye have filled H4390 (8765) the streets H2351 thereof with the slain H2491.
011:007 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Your slain H2491 whom ye have laid H7760 (8804) in the midst H8432 of it, they [are] the flesh H1320, and this [city is] the caldron H5518: but I will bring you forth H3318 (8689) out of the midst H8432 of it.
011:008 Ye have feared H3372 (8804) the sword H2719; and I will bring H0935 (8686) a sword H2719 upon you, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
011:009 And I will bring you out H3318 (8689) of the midst H8432 thereof, and deliver H5414 (8804) you into the hands H3027 of strangers H2114 (8801), and will execute H6213 (8804) judgments H8201 among you.
011:010 Ye shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719; I will judge H8199 (8799) you in the border H1366 of Israel H3478; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
011:011 This [city] shall not be your caldron H5518, neither shall ye be the flesh H1320 in the midst H8432 thereof; [but] I will judge H8199 (8799) you in the border H1366 of Israel H3478:
011:012 And ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068: for ye have not walked H1980 (8804) in my statutes H2706, neither executed H6213 (8804) my judgments H4941, but have done H6213 (8804) after the manners H4941 of the heathen H1471 that [are] round about H5439 you.
011:013 And it came to pass, when I prophesied H5012 (8736), that Pelatiah H6410 the son H1121 of Benaiah H1141 died H4191 (8804). Then fell I down H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440, and cried H2199 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963, and said H0559 (8799), Ah H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069! wilt thou make H6213 (8802) a full end H3617 of the remnant H7611 of Israel H3478?
011:014 Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
011:015 Son H1121 of man H0120, thy brethren H0251, [even] thy brethren H0251, the men H0582 of thy kindred H1353, and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 have said H0559 (8804), Get you far H7368 (8798) from the LORD H3068: unto us is this land H0776 given H5414 (8738) in possession H4181.
011:016 Therefore say H0559 (8798), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Although I have cast them far off H7368 (8689) among the heathen H1471, and although I have scattered H6327 (8689) them among the countries H0776, yet will I be to them as a little H4592 sanctuary H4720 in the countries H0776 where they shall come H0935 (8804).
011:017 Therefore say H0559 (8798), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will even gather H6908 (8765) you from the people H5971, and assemble H0622 (8804) you out of the countries H0776 where ye have been scattered H6327 (8738), and I will give H5414 (8804) you the land H0127 of Israel H3478.
011:018 And they shall come H0935 (8804) thither, and they shall take away H5493 (8689) all the detestable things H8251 thereof and all the abominations H8441 thereof from thence.
011:019 And I will give H5414 (8804) them one H0259 heart H3820, and I will put H5414 (8799) a new H2319 spirit H7307 within H7130 you; and I will take H5493 (8689) the stony H0068 heart H3820 out of their flesh H1320, and will give H5414 (8804) them an heart H3820 of flesh H1320:
011:020 That they may walk H3212 (8799) in my statutes H2708, and keep H8104 (8799) mine ordinances H4941, and do H6213 (8804) them: and they shall be my people H5971, and I will be their God H0430.
011:021 But [as for them] whose heart H3820 walketh H1980 (8802) after the heart H3820 of their detestable things H8251 and their abominations H8441, I will recompense H5414 (8804) their way H1870 upon their own heads H7218, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
011:022 Then did the cherubims H3742 lift up H5375 (8799) their wings H3671, and the wheels H0212 beside H5980 them; and the glory H3519 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 [was] over them above H4605.
011:023 And the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 went up H5927 (8799) from the midst H8432 of the city H5892, and stood H5975 (8799) upon the mountain H2022 which [is] on the east side H6924 of the city H5892.
011:024 Afterwards the spirit H7307 took me up H5375 (8804), and brought H0935 (8686) me in a vision H4758 by the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 into Chaldea H3778, to them of the captivity H1473. So the vision H4758 that I had seen H7200 (8804) went up H5927 (8799) from me.
011:025 Then I spake H1696 (8762) unto them of the captivity H1473 all the things H1697 that the LORD H3068 had shewed H7200 (8689) me.
012:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 also came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
012:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, thou dwellest H3427 (8802) in the midst H8432 of a rebellious H4805 house H1004, which have eyes H5869 to see H7200 (8800), and see H7200 (8804) not; they have ears H0241 to hear H8085 (8800), and hear H8085 (8804) not: for they [are] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
012:003 Therefore, thou son H1121 of man H0120, prepare H6213 (8798) thee stuff H3627 for removing H1473, and remove H1540 (8798) by day H3119 in their sight H5869; and thou shalt remove H1540 (8804) from thy place H4725 to another H0312 place H4725 in their sight H5869: it may be they will consider H7200 (8799), though they [be] a rebellious H4805 house H1004.
012:004 Then shalt thou bring forth H3318 (8689) thy stuff H3627 by day H3119 in their sight H5869, as stuff H3627 for removing H1473: and thou shalt go forth H3318 (8799) at even H6153 in their sight H5869, as they that go forth H4161 into captivity H1473.
012:005 Dig H2864 (8798) thou through the wall H7023 in their sight H5869, and carry out H3318 (8689) thereby.
012:006 In their sight H5869 shalt thou bear H5375 (8799) [it] upon [thy] shoulders H3802, [and] carry [it] forth H3318 (8686) in the twilight H5939: thou shalt cover H3680 (8762) thy face H6440, that thou see H7200 (8799) not the ground H0776: for I have set H5414 (8804) thee [for] a sign H4159 unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
012:007 And I did H6213 (8799) so as I was commanded H6680 (8795): I brought forth H3318 (8689) my stuff H3627 by day H3119, as stuff H3627 for captivity H1473, and in the even H6153 I digged H2864 (8804) through the wall H7023 with mine hand H3027; I brought [it] forth H3318 (8689) in the twilight H5939, [and] I bare H5375 (8804) [it] upon [my] shoulder H3802 in their sight H5869.
012:008 And in the morning H1242 came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
012:009 Son H1121 of man H0120, hath not the house H1004 of Israel H3478, the rebellious H4805 house H1004, said H0559 (8804) unto thee, What doest H6213 (8802) thou?
012:010 Say H0559 (8798) thou unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; This burden H4853 [concerneth] the prince H5387 in Jerusalem H3389, and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 that [are] among H8432 them.
012:011 Say H0559 (8798), I [am] your sign H4159: like as I have done H6213 (8804), so shall it be done H6213 (8735) unto them: they shall remove H1473 [and] go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628.
012:012 And the prince H5387 that [is] among H8432 them shall bear H5375 (8799) upon [his] shoulder H3802 in the twilight H5939, and shall go forth H3318 (8799): they shall dig H2864 (8799) through the wall H7023 to carry out H3318 (8687) thereby: he shall cover H3680 (8762) his face H6440, that H3282 he see H7200 (8799) not the ground H0776 with [his] eyes H5869.
012:013 My net H7568 also will I spread H6566 (8804) upon him, and he shall be taken H8610 (8738) in my snare H4686: and I will bring H0935 (8689) him to Babylon H0894 [to] the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778; yet shall he not see H7200 (8799) it, though he shall die H4191 (8799) there.
012:014 And I will scatter H2219 (8762) toward every wind H7307 all that [are] about H5439 him to help H5828 him, and all his bands H0102; and I will draw out H7324 (8686) the sword H2719 after H0310 them.
012:015 And they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I shall scatter H6327 (8687) them among the nations H1471, and disperse H2219 (8765) them in the countries H0776.
012:016 But I will leave H3498 (8689) a few H4557 men H0582 of them from the sword H2719, from the famine H7458, and from the pestilence H1698; that they may declare H5608 (8762) all their abominations H8441 among the heathen H1471 whither they come H0935 (8804); and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
012:017 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to me, saying H0559 (8800),
012:018 Son H1121 of man H0120, eat H0398 (8799) thy bread H3899 with quaking H7494, and drink H8354 (8799) thy water H4325 with trembling H7269 and with carefulness H1674;
012:019 And say H0559 (8804) unto the people H5971 of the land H0127, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, [and] of the land H0776 of Israel H3478; They shall eat H0398 (8799) their bread H3899 with carefulness H1674, and drink H8354 (8799) their water H4325 with astonishment H8078, that her land H0776 may be desolate H3456 (8799) from all that is therein H4393, because of the violence H2555 of all them that dwell H3427 (8802) therein.
012:020 And the cities H5892 that are inhabited H3427 (8737) shall be laid waste H2717 (8799), and the land H0776 shall be desolate H8077; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
012:021 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
012:022 Son H1121 of man H0120, what [is] that proverb H4912 [that] ye have in the land H0127 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The days H3117 are prolonged H0748 (8799), and every vision H2377 faileth H0006 (8804)?
012:023 Tell H0559 (8798) them therefore, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will make this proverb H4912 to cease H7673 (8689), and they shall no more use it as a proverb H4911 (8799) in Israel H3478; but say H1696 (8761) unto them, The days H3117 are at hand H7126 (8804), and the effect H1697 of every vision H2377.
012:024 For there shall be no more any vain H7723 vision H2377 nor flattering H2509 divination H4738 within H8432 the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
012:025 For I [am] the LORD H3068: I will speak H1696 (8762), and the word H1697 that I shall speak H1696 (8762) shall come to pass H6213 (8735); it shall be no more prolonged H4900 (8735): for in your days H3117, O rebellious H4805 house H1004, will I say H1696 (8762) the word H1697, and will perform H6213 (8804) it, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
012:026 Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to me, saying H0559 (8800),
012:027 Son H1121 of man H0120, behold, [they of] the house H1004 of Israel H3478 say H0559 (8802), The vision H2377 that he seeth H2372 (8802) [is] for many H7227 days H3117 [to come], and he prophesieth H5012 (8738) of the times H6256 [that are] far H7350 off.
012:028 Therefore say H0559 (8798) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; There shall none of my words H1697 be prolonged H4900 (8735) any more, but the word H1697 which I have spoken H1696 (8762) shall be done H6213 (8735), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
013:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
013:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) against the prophets H5030 of Israel H3478 that prophesy H5012 (8737), and say H0559 (8804) thou unto them that prophesy H5030 out of their own hearts H3820, Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068;
013:003 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Woe H1945 unto the foolish H5036 prophets H5030, that follow H1980 (8802) H0310 their own spirit H7307, and have seen H7200 (8804) nothing!
013:004 O Israel H3478, thy prophets H5030 are like the foxes H7776 in the deserts H2723.
013:005 Ye have not gone up H5927 (8804) into the gaps H6556, neither made up H1443 (8799) the hedge H1447 for the house H1004 of Israel H3478 to stand H5975 (8800) in the battle H4421 in the day H3117 of the LORD H3068.
013:006 They have seen H2372 (8804) vanity H7723 and lying H3577 divination H7081, saying H0559 (8802), The LORD H3068 saith H5002 (8803): and the LORD H3068 hath not sent H7971 (8804) them: and they have made [others] to hope H3176 (8765) that they would confirm H6965 (8763) the word H1697.
013:007 Have ye not seen H2372 (8804) a vain H7723 vision H4236, and have ye not spoken H1696 (8765) a lying H3577 divination H4738, whereas ye say H0559 (8802), The LORD H3068 saith H5002 (8803) [it]; albeit I have not spoken H0559 (8804)?
013:008 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because ye have spoken H1696 (8763) vanity H7723, and seen H2372 (8804) lies H3577, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
013:009 And mine hand H3027 shall be upon the prophets H5030 that see H2374 vanity H7723, and that divine H7080 (8802) lies H3577: they shall not be in the assembly H5475 of my people H5971, neither shall they be written H3789 (8735) in the writing H3791 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, neither shall they enter H0935 (8799) into the land H0127 of Israel H3478; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
013:010 Because, even because they have seduced H2937 (8689) my people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Peace H7965; and [there was] no peace H7965; and one built up H1129 (8802) a wall H2434, and, lo H2009, others daubed H2902 (8802) it with untempered H8602 [morter]:
013:011 Say H0559 (8798) unto them which daub H2902 (8802) [it] with untempered H8602 [morter], that it shall fall H5307 (8799): there shall be an overflowing H7857 (8802) shower H1653; and ye H0859, O great hailstones H0417 H0068, shall fall H5307 (8799); and a stormy H5591 wind H7307 shall rend H1234 (8762) [it].
013:012 Lo, when the wall H7023 is fallen H5307 (8804), shall it not be said H0559 (8735) unto you, Where [is] the daubing H2915 wherewith ye have daubed H2902 (8804) [it]?
013:013 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will even rend H1234 (8765) [it] with a stormy H5591 wind H7307 in my fury H2534; and there shall be an overflowing H7857 (8802) shower H1653 in mine anger H0639, and great hailstones H0417 H0068 in [my] fury H2534 to consume H3617 [it].
013:014 So will I break down H2040 (8804) the wall H7023 that ye have daubed H2902 (8804) with untempered H8602 [morter], and bring H5060 (8689) it down to the ground H0776, so that the foundation H3247 thereof shall be discovered H1540 (8738), and it shall fall H5307 (8804), and ye shall be consumed H3615 (8804) in the midst H8432 thereof: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
013:015 Thus will I accomplish H3615 (8765) my wrath H2534 upon the wall H7023, and upon them that have daubed H2902 (8802) it with untempered H8602 [morter], and will say H0559 (8799) unto you, The wall H7023 [is] no [more], neither they that daubed H2902 (8802) it;
013:016 [To wit], the prophets H5030 of Israel H3478 which prophesy H5012 (8737) concerning Jerusalem H3389, and which see H2374 visions H2377 of peace H7965 for her, and [there is] no peace H7965, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
013:017 Likewise, thou son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against the daughters H1323 of thy people H5971, which prophesy H5012 (8693) out of their own heart H3820; and prophesy H5012 (8734) thou against them,
013:018 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Woe H1945 to the [women] that sew H8609 (8764) pillows H3704 to all armholes H0679 H3027, and make H6213 (8802) kerchiefs H4555 upon the head H7218 of every stature H6967 to hunt H6679 (8780) souls H5315! Will ye hunt H6679 (8779) the souls H5315 of my people H5971, and will ye save H2421 the souls H5315 alive H2421 (8762) [that come] unto you?
013:019 And will ye pollute H2490 (8762) me among my people H5971 for handfuls H8168 of barley H8184 and for pieces H6595 of bread H3899, to slay H4191 (8687) the souls H5315 that should not die H4191 (8799), and to save H2421 the souls H5315 alive H2421 (8763) that should not live H2421 (8799), by your lying H3576 (8763) to my people H5971 that hear H8085 (8802) [your] lies H3577?
013:020 Wherefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against your pillows H3704, wherewith ye H0859 there hunt H6679 (8781) the souls H5315 to make [them] fly H6524 (8802), and I will tear H7167 (8804) them from your arms H2220, and will let the souls H5315 go H7971 (8765), [even] the souls H5315 that ye hunt H6679 (8781) to make [them] fly H6524 (8802).
013:021 Your kerchiefs H4555 also will I tear H7167 (8804), and deliver H5337 (8689) my people H5971 out of your hand H3027, and they shall be no more in your hand H3027 to be hunted H4686; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
013:022 Because with lies H8267 ye have made the heart H3820 of the righteous H6662 sad H3512 (8687), whom I have not made sad H3510 (8689); and strengthened H2388 (8763) the hands H3027 of the wicked H7451, that he should not return H7725 (8800) from his wicked H7563 way H1870, by promising him life H2421 (8687):
013:023 Therefore ye shall see H2372 (8799) no more vanity H7723, nor divine H7080 (8799) divinations H7081: for I will deliver H5337 (8689) my people H5971 out of your hand H3027: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
014:001 ¶ Then came H0935 (8799) certain H0582 of the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 unto me, and sat H3427 (8799) before H6440 me.
014:002 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
014:003 Son H1121 of man H0120, these men H0582 have set up H5927 (8689) their idols H1544 in their heart H3820, and put H5414 (8804) the stumblingblock H4383 of their iniquity H5771 before H5227 their face H6440: should I be enquired H1875 (8735) of at all H1875 (8736) by them?
014:004 Therefore speak H1696 (8761) unto them, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Every man H0376 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 that setteth up H5927 (8686) his idols H1544 in his heart H3820, and putteth H7760 (8799) the stumblingblock H4383 of his iniquity H5771 before H5227 his face H6440, and cometh H0935 (8804) to the prophet H5030; I the LORD H3068 will answer H6030 (8738) him that cometh H0935 (8804) according to the multitude H7230 of his idols H1544;
014:005 That I may take H8610 (8800) the house H1004 of Israel H3478 in their own heart H3820, because they are all estranged H2114 (8738) from me through their idols H1544.
014:006 Therefore say H0559 (8798) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Repent H7725 (8798), and turn H7725 (8685) [yourselves] from your idols H1544; and turn away H7725 (8685) your faces H6440 from all your abominations H8441.
014:007 For every one H0376 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, or of the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8799) in Israel H3478, which separateth H5144 (8735) himself from me H0310, and setteth up H5927 (8799) his idols H1544 in his heart H3820, and putteth H7760 (8799) the stumblingblock H4383 of his iniquity H5771 before H5227 his face H6440, and cometh H0935 (8804) to a prophet H5030 to enquire H1875 (8800) of him concerning me; I the LORD H3068 will answer H6030 (8737) him by myself:
014:008 And I will set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 against that man H0376, and will make H8074 (8689) him a sign H0226 and a proverb H4912, and I will cut him off H3772 (8689) from the midst H8432 of my people H5971; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
014:009 And if the prophet H5030 be deceived H6601 (8792) when he hath spoken H1696 (8765) a thing H1697, I the LORD H3068 have deceived H6601 (8765) that prophet H5030, and I will stretch out H5186 (8804) my hand H3027 upon him, and will destroy H8045 (8689) him from the midst H8432 of my people H5971 Israel H3478.
014:010 And they shall bear H5375 (8804) the punishment of their iniquity H5771: the punishment H5771 of the prophet H5030 shall be even as the punishment H5771 of him that seeketh H1875 (8802) [unto him];
014:011 That the house H1004 of Israel H3478 may go no more astray H8582 (8799) from me H0310, neither be polluted H2930 (8691) any more with all their transgressions H6588; but that they may be my people H5971, and I may be their God H0430, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
014:012 The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again to me, saying H0559 (8800),
014:013 Son H1121 of man H0120, when the land H0776 sinneth H2398 (8799) against me by trespassing H4603 (8800) grievously H4604, then will I stretch out H5186 (8804) mine hand H3027 upon it, and will break H7665 (8804) the staff H4294 of the bread H3899 thereof, and will send H7971 (8689) famine H7458 upon it, and will cut off H3772 (8689) man H0120 and beast H0929 from it:
014:014 Though these three H7969 men H0582, Noah H5146, Daniel H1840, and Job H0347, were in it H8432, they should deliver H5337 (8762) [but] their own souls H5315 by their righteousness H6666, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
014:015 If H3863 I cause noisome H7451 beasts H2416 to pass through H5674 (8686) the land H0776, and they spoil H7921 (8765) it, so that it be desolate H8077, that no man may pass through H5674 (8802) because H6440 of the beasts H2416:
014:016 [Though] these three H7969 men H0582 [were] in it H8432, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, they shall deliver H5337 (8686) neither sons H1121 nor daughters H1323; they only shall be delivered H5337 (8735), but the land H0776 shall be desolate H8077.
014:017 Or [if] I bring H0935 (8686) a sword H2719 upon that land H0776, and say H0559 (8804), Sword H2719, go through H5674 (8799) the land H0776; so that I cut off H3772 (8689) man H0120 and beast H0929 from it:
014:018 Though these three H7969 men H0582 [were] in it H8432, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, they shall deliver H5337 (8686) neither sons H1121 nor daughters H1323, but they only shall be delivered H5337 (8735) themselves.
014:019 Or [if] I send H7971 (8762) a pestilence H1698 into that land H0776, and pour out H8210 (8804) my fury H2534 upon it in blood H1818, to cut off H3772 (8687) from it man H0120 and beast H0929:
014:020 Though Noah H5146, Daniel H1840, and Job H0347, [were] in it H8432, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, they shall deliver H5337 (8686) neither son H1121 nor H0518 daughter H1323; they shall [but] deliver H5337 (8686) their own souls H5315 by their righteousness H6666.
014:021 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; How much more when I send H7971 (8765) my four H0702 sore H7451 judgments H8201 upon Jerusalem H3389, the sword H2719, and the famine H7458, and the noisome H7451 beast H2416, and the pestilence H1698, to cut off H3772 (8687) from it man H0120 and beast H0929?
014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left H3498 (8738) a remnant H6413 that shall be brought forth H3318 (8716), [both] sons H1121 and daughters H1323: behold, they shall come forth H3318 (8802) unto you, and ye shall see H7200 (8804) their way H1870 and their doings H5949: and ye shall be comforted H5162 (8738) concerning the evil H7451 that I have brought H0935 (8689) upon Jerusalem H3389, [even] concerning all that I have brought H0935 (8689) upon it.
014:023 And they shall comfort H5162 (8765) you, when ye see H7200 (8799) their ways H1870 and their doings H5949: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I have not done H6213 (8804) without cause H2600 all that I have done H6213 (8804) in it, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
015:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
015:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, What is the vine H1612 tree H6086 more than any tree H6086, [or than] a branch H2156 which is among the trees H6086 of the forest H3293?
015:003 Shall wood H6086 be taken H3947 (8714) thereof to do H6213 (8800) any work H4399? or will [men] take H3947 (8799) a pin H3489 of it to hang H8518 (8800) any vessel H3627 thereon?
015:004 Behold, it is cast H5414 (8738) into the fire H0784 for fuel H0402; the fire H0784 devoureth H0398 (8804) both H8147 the ends H7098 of it, and the midst H8432 of it is burned H2787 (8737). Is it meet H6743 (8799) for [any] work H4399?
015:005 Behold, when it was whole H8549, it was meet H6213 (8735) for no work H4399: how much less shall it be meet H6213 (8738) yet for [any] work H4399, when the fire H0784 hath devoured H0398 (8804) it, and it is burned H2787 (8735)?
015:006 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; As the vine H1612 tree H6086 among the trees H6086 of the forest H3293, which I have given H5414 (8804) to the fire H0784 for fuel H0402, so will I give H5414 (8804) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389.
015:007 And I will set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 against them; they shall go out H3318 (8804) from [one] fire H0784, and [another] fire H0784 shall devour H0398 (8799) them; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I set H7760 (8800) my face H6440 against them.
015:008 And I will make H5414 (8804) the land H0776 desolate H8077, because they have committed H4603 (8804) a trespass H4604, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
016:001 ¶ Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
016:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, cause Jerusalem H3389 to know H3045 (8685) her abominations H8441,
016:003 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 unto Jerusalem H3389; Thy birth H4351 and thy nativity H4138 [is] of the land H0776 of Canaan H3669; thy father H0001 [was] an Amorite H0567, and thy mother H0517 an Hittite H2850.
016:004 And [as for] thy nativity H4138, in the day H3117 thou wast born H3205 (8715) thy navel H8270 was not cut H3772 (8795), neither wast thou washed H7364 (8795) in water H4325 to supple H4935 [thee]; thou wast not salted H4414 (8717) at all H4414 (8715), nor swaddled H2853 (8795) at all H2853 (8715).
016:005 None eye H5869 pitied H2347 (8804) thee, to do H6213 (8800) any H0259 of these unto thee, to have compassion H2550 (8800) upon thee; but thou wast cast out H7993 (8714) in the open H6440 field H7704, to the lothing H1604 of thy person H5315, in the day H3117 that thou wast born H3205 (8715).
016:006 And when I passed H5674 (8799) by thee, and saw H7200 (8799) thee polluted H0947 (8711) in thine own blood H1818, I said H0559 (8799) unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood H1818, Live H2421 (8798); yea, I said H0559 (8799) unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood H1818, Live H2421 (8798).
016:007 I have caused H5414 (8804) thee to multiply H7233 as the bud H6780 of the field H7704, and thou hast increased H7235 (8799) and waxen great H1431 (8799), and thou art come H0935 (8799) to excellent H5716 ornaments H5716: [thy] breasts H7699 are fashioned H3559 (8738), and thine hair H8181 is grown H6779 (8765), whereas thou [wast] naked H5903 and bare H6181.
016:008 Now when I passed H5674 (8799) by thee, and looked H7200 (8799) upon thee, behold, thy time H6256 [was] the time H6256 of love H1730; and I spread H6566 (8799) my skirt H3671 over thee, and covered H3680 (8762) thy nakedness H6172: yea, I sware H7650 (8735) unto thee, and entered H0935 (8799) into a covenant H1285 with thee, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, and thou becamest mine.
016:009 Then washed H7364 (8799) I thee with water H4325; yea, I throughly washed away H7857 (8799) thy blood H1818 from thee, and I anointed H5480 (8799) thee with oil H8081.
016:010 I clothed H3847 (8686) thee also with broidered work H7553, and shod H5274 (8799) thee with badgers’ skin H8476, and I girded H2280 (8799) thee about with fine linen H8336, and I covered H3680 (8762) thee with silk H4897.
016:011 I decked H5710 (8799) thee also with ornaments H5716, and I put H5414 (8799) bracelets H6781 upon thy hands H3027, and a chain H7242 on thy neck H1627.
016:012 And I put H5414 (8799) a jewel H5141 on thy forehead H0639, and earrings H5694 in thine ears H0241, and a beautiful H8597 crown H5850 upon thine head H7218.
016:013 Thus wast thou decked H5710 (8799) with gold H2091 and silver H3701; and thy raiment H4403 [was of] fine linen H8336 (8675) H8336, and silk H4897, and broidered work H7553; thou didst eat H0398 (8804) fine flour H5560, and honey H1706, and oil H8081: and thou wast exceeding H3966 beautiful H3302 (8799), and thou didst prosper H6743 (8799) into a kingdom H4410.
016:014 And thy renown H8034 went forth H3318 (8799) among the heathen H1471 for thy beauty H3308: for it [was] perfect H3632 through my comeliness H1926, which I had put H7760 (8804) upon thee, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
016:015 But thou didst trust H0982 (8799) in thine own beauty H3308, and playedst the harlot H2181 (8799) because of thy renown H8034, and pouredst out H8210 (8799) thy fornications H8457 on every one that passed by H5674 (8802); his it was.
016:016 And of thy garments H0899 thou didst take H3947 (8799), and deckedst H6213 (8799) thy high places H1116 with divers colours H2921 (8803), and playedst the harlot H2181 (8799) thereupon: [the like things] shall not come H0935 (8802), neither shall it be [so].
016:017 Thou hast also taken H3947 (8799) thy fair H8597 jewels H3627 of my gold H2091 and of my silver H3701, which I had given H5414 (8804) thee, and madest H6213 (8799) to thyself images H6754 of men H2145, and didst commit whoredom H2181 (8799) with them,
016:018 And tookest H3947 (8799) thy broidered H7553 garments H0899, and coveredst H3680 (8762) them: and thou hast set H5414 (8804) mine oil H8081 and mine incense H7004 before H6440 them.
016:019 My meat H3899 also which I gave H5414 (8804) thee, fine flour H5560, and oil H8081, and honey H1706, [wherewith] I fed H0398 (8689) thee, thou hast even set H5414 (8804) it before H6440 them for a sweet H5207 savour H7381: and [thus] it was, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
016:020 Moreover thou hast taken H3947 (8799) thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323, whom thou hast borne H3205 (8804) unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed H2076 (8799) unto them to be devoured H0398 (8800). [Is this] of thy whoredoms H8457 a small matter H4592,
016:021 That thou hast slain H7819 (8799) my children H1121, and delivered H5414 (8799) them to cause them to pass through H5674 (8687) [the fire] for them?
016:022 And in all thine abominations H8441 and thy whoredoms H8457 thou hast not remembered H2142 (8804) the days H3117 of thy youth H5271, when thou wast naked H5903 and bare H6181, [and] wast polluted H0947 (8711) in thy blood H1818.
016:023 And it came to pass after H0310 all thy wickedness H7451, (woe H0188, woe H0188 unto thee! saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069;)
016:024 [That] thou hast also built H1129 (8799) unto thee an eminent place H1354, and hast made H6213 (8799) thee an high place H7413 in every street H7339.
016:025 Thou hast built H1129 (8804) thy high place H7413 at every head H7218 of the way H1870, and hast made thy beauty H3308 to be abhorred H8581 (8762), and hast opened H6589 (8762) thy feet H7272 to every one that passed by H5674 (8802), and multiplied H7235 (8686) thy whoredoms H8457.
016:026 Thou hast also committed fornication H2181 (8799) with the Egyptians H1121 H4714 thy neighbours H7934, great H1432 of flesh H1320; and hast increased H7235 (8686) thy whoredoms H8457, to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687).
016:027 Behold, therefore I have stretched out H5186 (8804) my hand H3027 over thee, and have diminished H1639 (8799) thine ordinary H2706 [food], and delivered H5414 (8799) thee unto the will H5315 of them that hate H8130 (8802) thee, the daughters H1323 of the Philistines H6430, which are ashamed H3637 (8737) of thy lewd H2154 way H1870.
016:028 Thou hast played the whore H2181 (8799) also with the Assyrians H1121 H0804, because H1115 thou wast unsatiable H7646 (8804); yea, thou hast played the harlot H2181 (8799) with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied H7654.
016:029 Thou hast moreover multiplied H7235 (8686) thy fornication H8457 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 unto Chaldea H3778; and yet thou wast not satisfied H7646 (8804) herewith H2063.
016:030 How weak H0535 (8802) is thine heart H3826, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, seeing thou doest H6213 (8800) all these [things], the work H4639 of an imperious H7986 whorish H2181 (8803) woman H0802;
016:031 In that thou buildest H1129 (8800) thine eminent place H1354 in the head H7218 of every way H1870, and makest H6213 (8804) thine high place H7413 in every street H7339; and hast not been as an harlot H2181 (8802), in that thou scornest H7046 (8763) hire H0868;
016:032 [But as] a wife H0802 that committeth adultery H5003 (8764), [which] taketh H3947 (8799) strangers H2114 (8801) instead of her husband H0376!
016:033 They give H5414 (8799) gifts H5078 to all whores H2181 (8802): but thou givest H5414 (8804) thy gifts H5083 to all thy lovers H0157 (8764), and hirest H7809 (8799) them, that they may come H0935 (8800) unto thee on every side H5439 for thy whoredom H8457.
016:034 And the contrary H2016 is in thee from [other] women H0802 in thy whoredoms H8457, whereas none followeth H0310 thee to commit whoredoms H2181 (8795): and in that thou givest H5414 (8800) a reward H0868, and no reward H0868 is given H5414 (8738) unto thee, therefore thou art H1961 (8799) contrary H2016.
016:035 Wherefore, O harlot H2181 (8802), hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068:
016:036 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thy filthiness H5178 was poured out H8210 (8736), and thy nakedness H6172 discovered H1540 (8735) through thy whoredoms H8457 with thy lovers H0157 (8764), and with all the idols H1544 of thy abominations H8441, and by the blood H1818 of thy children H1121, which thou didst give H5414 (8804) unto them;
016:037 Behold, therefore I will gather H6908 (8764) all thy lovers H0157 (8764), with whom thou hast taken pleasure H6149 (8804), and all [them] that thou hast loved H0157 (8804), with all [them] that thou hast hated H8130 (8804); I will even gather H6908 (8765) them round about H5439 against thee, and will discover H1540 (8765) thy nakedness H6172 unto them, that they may see H7200 (8804) all thy nakedness H6172.
016:038 And I will judge H8199 (8804) thee, as women that break wedlock H5003 (8802) and shed H8210 (8802) blood H1818 are judged H4941; and I will give H5414 (8804) thee blood H1818 in fury H2534 and jealousy H7068.
016:039 And I will also give H5414 (8804) thee into their hand H3027, and they shall throw down H2040 (8804) thine eminent place H1354, and shall break down H5422 (8765) thy high places H7413: they shall strip H6584 (8689) thee also of thy clothes H0899, and shall take H3947 (8804) thy fair H8597 jewels H3627, and leave H3240 (8689) thee naked H5903 and bare H6181.
016:040 They shall also bring up H5927 (8689) a company H6951 against thee, and they shall stone H7275 (8804) thee with stones H0068, and thrust thee through H1333 (8765) with their swords H2719.
016:041 And they shall burn H8313 (8804) thine houses H1004 with fire H0784, and execute H6213 (8804) judgments H8201 upon thee in the sight H5869 of many H7227 women H0802: and I will cause thee to cease H7673 (8689) from playing the harlot H2181 (8802), and thou also shalt give H5414 (8799) no hire H0868 any more.
016:042 So will I make my fury H2534 toward thee to rest H5117 (8689), and my jealousy H7068 shall depart H5493 (8804) from thee, and I will be quiet H8252 (8804), and will be no more angry H3707 (8799).
016:043 Because thou hast not remembered H2142 (8804) the days H3117 of thy youth H5271, but hast fretted H7264 (8799) me in all these [things]; behold H1887, therefore I also will recompense H5414 (8804) thy way H1870 upon [thine] head H7218, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: and thou shalt not commit H6213 (8804) this lewdness H2154 above all thine abominations H8441.
016:044 Behold, every one that useth proverbs H4911 (8802) shall use [this] proverb H4911 (8799) against thee, saying H0559 (8800), As [is] the mother H0517, [so is] her daughter H1323.
016:045 Thou [art] thy mother’s H0517 daughter H1323, that lotheth H1602 (8802) her husband H0376 and her children H1121; and thou [art] the sister H0269 of thy sisters H0269, which lothed H1602 (8804) their husbands H0582 and their children H1121: your mother H0517 [was] an Hittite H2850, and your father H0001 an Amorite H0567.
016:046 And thine elder H1419 sister H0269 [is] Samaria H8111, she and her daughters H1323 that dwell H3427 (8802) at thy left hand H8040: and thy younger H6996 sister H0269, that dwelleth H3427 (8802) at thy right hand H3225, [is] Sodom H5467 and her daughters H1323.
016:047 Yet hast thou not walked H1980 (8804) after their ways H1870, nor done H6213 (8804) after their abominations H8441: but, as [if that were] a very H6985 little H4592 H6962 (8804) [thing], thou wast corrupted H7843 (8686) more than they H2004 in all thy ways H1870.
016:048 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, Sodom H5467 thy sister H0269 hath not done H6213 (8804), she nor her daughters H1323, as thou hast done H6213 (8804), thou and thy daughters H1323.
016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity H5771 of thy sister H0269 Sodom H5467, pride H1347, fulness H7653 of bread H3899, and abundance H7962 of idleness H8252 (8687) was in her and in her daughters H1323, neither did she strengthen H2388 (8689) the hand H3027 of the poor H6041 and needy H0034.
016:050 And they were haughty H1361 (8799), and committed H6213 (8799) abomination H8441 before H6440 me: therefore I took them away H5493 (8686) as I saw H7200 (8804) [good].
016:051 Neither hath Samaria H8111 committed H2398 (8804) half H2677 of thy sins H2403; but thou hast multiplied H7235 (8686) thine abominations H8441 more than they H2007, and hast justified H6663 (8762) thy sisters H0269 in all thine abominations H8441 which thou hast done H6213 (8804).
016:052 Thou also, which hast judged H6419 (8765) thy sisters H0269, bear H5375 (8798) thine own shame H3639 for thy sins H2403 that thou hast committed more abominable H8581 (8689) than they H2004: they are more righteous H6663 (8799) than thou: yea, be thou confounded H0954 (8798) also, and bear H5375 (8798) thy shame H3639, in that thou hast justified H6663 (8763) thy sisters H0269.
016:053 When I shall bring again H7725 (8804) their captivity H7622 (8675) H7622, the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of Sodom H5467 and her daughters H1323, and the captivity H7622 (8676) H7622 of Samaria H8111 and her daughters H1323, then [will I bring again] the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of thy captives H7622 in the midst H8432 of them:
016:054 That thou mayest bear H5375 (8799) thine own shame H3639, and mayest be confounded H3637 (8738) in all that thou hast done H6213 (8804), in that thou art a comfort H5162 (8763) unto them.
016:055 When thy sisters H0269, Sodom H5467 and her daughters H1323, shall return H7725 (8799) to their former estate H6927, and Samaria H8111 and her daughters H1323 shall return H7725 (8799) to their former estate H6927, then thou and thy daughters H1323 shall return H7725 (8799) to your former estate H6927.
016:056 For thy sister H0269 Sodom H5467 was not mentioned H8052 by thy mouth H6310 in the day H3117 of thy pride H1347,
016:057 Before thy wickedness H7451 was discovered H1540 (8735), as at the time H6256 of [thy] reproach H2781 of the daughters H1323 of Syria H0758, and all [that are] round about H5439 her, the daughters H1323 of the Philistines H6430, which despise H7590 (8801) thee round about H5439.
016:058 Thou hast borne H5375 (8804) thy lewdness H2154 and thine abominations H8441, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
016:059 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will even deal H6213 (8804) with thee as thou hast done H6213 (8804), which hast despised H0959 (8804) the oath H0423 in breaking H6565 (8687) the covenant H1285.
016:060 Nevertheless I will remember H2142 (8804) my covenant H1285 with thee in the days H3117 of thy youth H5271, and I will establish H6965 (8689) unto thee an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285.
016:061 Then thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) thy ways H1870, and be ashamed H3637 (8738), when thou shalt receive H3947 (8800) thy sisters H0269, thine elder H1419 and thy younger H6996: and I will give H5414 (8804) them unto thee for daughters H1323, but not by thy covenant H1285.
016:062 And I will establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285 with thee; and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068:
016:063 That thou mayest remember H2142 (8799), and be confounded H0954 (8804), and never open H6610 thy mouth H6310 any more because H6440 of thy shame H3639, when I am pacified H3722 (8763) toward thee for all that thou hast done H6213 (8804), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
017:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
017:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, put forth H2330 (8798) a riddle H2420, and speak H4911 (8798) a parable H4912 unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478;
017:003 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; A great H1419 eagle H5404 with great H1419 wings H3671, longwinged H0083 H0750, full H4392 of feathers H5133, which had divers colours H7553, came H0935 (8804) unto Lebanon H3844, and took H3947 (8799) the highest branch H6788 of the cedar H0730:
017:004 He cropped off H6998 (8804) the top H7218 of his young twigs H3242, and carried H0935 (8686) it into a land H0776 of traffick H3667; he set H7760 (8804) it in a city H5892 of merchants H7402 (8802).
017:005 He took H3947 (8799) also of the seed H2233 of the land H0776, and planted H5414 (8799) it in a fruitful H2233 field H7704; he placed H3947 (8804) [it] by great H7227 waters H4325, [and] set H7760 (8804) it [as] a willow tree H6851.
017:006 And it grew H6779 (8799), and became a spreading H5628 (8802) vine H1612 of low H8217 stature H6967, whose branches H1808 turned H6437 (8800) toward him, and the roots H8328 thereof were under him: so it became a vine H1612, and brought forth H6213 (8799) branches H0905, and shot H7971 (8762) forth sprigs H6288.
017:007 There was also another H0259 great H1419 eagle H5404 with great H1419 wings H3671 and many H7227 feathers H5133: and, behold, this vine H1612 did bend H3719 (8804) her roots H8328 toward him, and shot forth H7971 (8765) her branches H1808 toward him, that he might water H8248 (8687) it by the furrows H6170 of her plantation H4302.
017:008 It was planted H8362 (8803) in a good H2896 soil H7704 by great H7227 waters H4325, that it might bring forth H6213 (8800) branches H6057, and that it might bear H5375 (8800) fruit H6529, that it might be a goodly H0155 vine H1612.
017:009 Say H0559 (8798) thou, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Shall it prosper H6743 (8799)? shall he not pull up H5423 (8762) the roots H8328 thereof, and cut off H7082 (8779) the fruit H6529 thereof, that it wither H3001 (8804)? it shall wither H3001 (8799) in all the leaves H2964 of her spring H6780, even without great H1419 power H2220 or many H7227 people H5971 to pluck it up H5375 (8800) by the roots H8328 thereof.
017:010 Yea, behold, [being] planted H8362 (8803), shall it prosper H6743 (8799)? shall it not utterly H3001 (8800) wither H3001 (8799), when the east H6921 wind H7307 toucheth H5060 (8800) it? it shall wither H3001 (8799) in the furrows H6170 where it grew H6780.
017:011 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
017:012 Say H0559 (8798) now to the rebellious H4805 house H1004, Know H3045 (8804) ye not what these [things mean]? tell H0559 (8798) [them], Behold, the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 is come H0935 (8802) to Jerusalem H3389, and hath taken H3947 (8799) the king H4428 thereof, and the princes H8269 thereof, and led H0935 (8686) them with him to Babylon H0894;
017:013 And hath taken H3947 (8799) of the king’s H4410 seed H2233, and made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with him, and hath taken H0935 (8686) an oath H0423 of him: he hath also taken H3947 (8804) the mighty H0352 of the land H0776:
017:014 That the kingdom H4467 might be base H8217, that it might not lift itself up H5375 (8692), [but] that by keeping H8104 (8800) of his covenant H1285 it might stand H5975 (8800).
017:015 But he rebelled H4775 (8799) against him in sending H7971 (8800) his ambassadors H4397 into Egypt H4714, that they might give H5414 (8800) him horses H5483 and much H7227 people H5971. Shall he prosper H6743 (8799)? shall he escape H4422 (8735) that doeth H6213 (8802) such [things]? or shall he break H6565 (8689) the covenant H1285, and be delivered H4422 (8738)?
017:016 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, surely in the place H4725 [where] the king H4428 [dwelleth] that made him king H4427 (8688), whose oath H0423 he despised H0959 (8804), and whose covenant H1285 he brake H6565 (8689), [even] with him in the midst H8432 of Babylon H0894 he shall die H4191 (8799).
017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh H6547 with [his] mighty H1419 army H2428 and great H7227 company H6951 make H6213 (8799) for him in the war H4421, by casting up H8210 (8800) mounts H5550, and building H1129 (8800) forts H1785, to cut off H3772 (8687) many H7227 persons H5315:
017:018 Seeing he despised H0959 (8804) the oath H0423 by breaking H6565 (8687) the covenant H1285, when, lo, he had given H5414 (8804) his hand H3027, and hath done H6213 (8804) all these [things], he shall not escape H4422 (8735).
017:019 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; [As] I live H2416, surely mine oath H0423 that he hath despised H0959 (8804), and my covenant H1285 that he hath broken H6331 (8689), even it will I recompense H5414 (8804) upon his own head H7218.
017:020 And I will spread H6566 (8804) my net H7568 upon him, and he shall be taken H8610 (8738) in my snare H4686, and I will bring H0935 (8689) him to Babylon H0894, and will plead H8199 (8738) with him there for his trespass H4603 (8804) that he hath trespassed H4604 against me.
017:021 And all his fugitives H4015 with all his bands H0102 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719, and they that remain H7604 (8737) shall be scattered H6566 (8735) toward all winds H7307: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
017:022 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will also take H3947 (8804) of the highest branch H6788 of the high H7311 (8802) cedar H0730, and will set H5414 (8804) [it]; I will crop off H6998 (8799) from the top H7218 of his young twigs H3127 a tender one H7390, and will plant H8362 (8804) [it] upon an high H1364 mountain H2022 and eminent H8524 (8803):
017:023 In the mountain H2022 of the height H4791 of Israel H3478 will I plant H8362 (8799) it: and it shall bring forth H5375 (8804) boughs H6057, and bear H6213 (8804) fruit H6529, and be a goodly H0117 cedar H0730: and under it shall dwell H7931 (8804) all fowl H6833 of every wing H3671; in the shadow H6738 of the branches H1808 thereof shall they dwell H7931 (8799).
017:024 And all the trees H6086 of the field H7704 shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have brought down H8213 (8689) the high H1364 tree H6086, have exalted H1361 (8689) the low H8217 tree H6086, have dried H3001 (8689) up the green H3892 tree H6086, and have made the dry H3002 tree H6086 to flourish H6524 (8689): I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) and have done H6213 (8804) [it].
018:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me again, saying H0559 (8800),
018:002 What mean ye, that ye use H4911 (8802) this proverb H4912 concerning the land H0127 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The fathers H0001 have eaten H0398 (8799) sour grapes H1155, and the children’s H1121 teeth H8127 are set on edge H6949 (8799)?
018:003 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use H4911 (8800) this proverb H4912 in Israel H3478.
018:004 Behold, all souls H5315 are mine; as the soul H5315 of the father H0001, so also the soul H5315 of the son H1121 is mine: the soul H5315 that sinneth H2398 (8802), it shall die H4191 (8799).
018:005 But if a man H0376 be just H6662, and do H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666,
018:006 [And] hath not eaten H0398 (8804) upon the mountains H2022, neither hath lifted up H5375 (8804) his eyes H5869 to the idols H1544 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, neither hath defiled H2930 (8765) his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802, neither hath come near H7126 (8799) to a menstruous H5079 woman H0802,
018:007 And hath not oppressed H3238 (8686) any H0376, [but] hath restored H7725 (8686) to the debtor H2326 his pledge H2258, hath spoiled H1497 (8799) none by violence H1500, hath given H5414 (8799) his bread H3899 to the hungry H7457, and hath covered H3680 (8762) the naked H5903 with a garment H0899;
018:008 He [that] hath not given forth H5414 (8799) upon usury H5392, neither hath taken H3947 (8799) any increase H8636, [that] hath withdrawn H7725 (8686) his hand H3027 from iniquity H5766, hath executed H6213 (8799) true H0571 judgment H4941 between man H0376 and man H0376,
018:009 Hath walked H1980 (8762) in my statutes H2708, and hath kept H8104 (8804) my judgments H4941, to deal H6213 (8800) truly H0571; he [is] just H6662, he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
018:010 If he beget H3205 (8689) a son H1121 [that is] a robber H6530, a shedder H8210 (8802) of blood H1818, and [that] doeth H6213 (8804) the like H0251 to [any] one H0259 of these [things],
018:011 And that doeth H6213 (8804) not any of those [duties], but even hath eaten H0398 (8804) upon the mountains H2022, and defiled H2930 (8765) his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802,
018:012 Hath oppressed H3238 (8689) the poor H6041 and needy H0034, hath spoiled H1497 (8804) by violence H1500, hath not restored H7725 (8686) the pledge H2258, and hath lifted up H5375 (8804) his eyes H5869 to the idols H1544, hath committed H6213 (8804) abomination H8441,
018:013 Hath given forth H5414 (8804) upon usury H5392, and hath taken H3947 (8804) increase H8636: shall he then live H2425 (8804)? he shall not live H2421 (8799): he hath done H6213 (8804) all these abominations H8441; he shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8714); his blood H1818 shall be upon him.
018:014 Now, lo, [if] he beget H3205 (8689) a son H1121, that seeth H7200 (8799) all his father’s H0001 sins H2403 which he hath done H6213 (8804), and considereth H7200 (8799), and doeth H6213 (8799) not such like H2004,
018:015 [That] hath not eaten H0398 (8804) upon the mountains H2022, neither hath lifted up H5375 (8804) his eyes H5869 to the idols H1544 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, hath not defiled H2930 (8765) his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802,
018:016 Neither hath oppressed H3238 (8689) any H0376, hath not withholden H2254 (8804) the pledge H2258, neither hath spoiled H1497 (8804) by violence H1500, [but] hath given H5414 (8804) his bread H3899 to the hungry H7457, and hath covered H3680 (8765) the naked H5903 with a garment H0899,
018:017 [That] hath taken off H7725 (8689) his hand H3027 from the poor H6041, [that] hath not received H3947 (8804) usury H5392 nor increase H8636, hath executed H6213 (8804) my judgments H4941, hath walked H1980 (8804) in my statutes H2708; he shall not die H4191 (8799) for the iniquity H5771 of his father H0001, he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799).
018:018 [As for] his father H0001, because he cruelly H6233 oppressed H6231 (8804), spoiled H1497 (8804) his brother H0251 by violence H1499, and did H6213 (8804) [that] which [is] not good H2896 among H8432 his people H5971, lo, even he shall die H4191 (8801) in his iniquity H5771.
018:019 Yet say H0559 (8804) ye, Why? doth not the son H1121 bear H5375 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of the father H0001? When the son H1121 hath done H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666, [and] hath kept H8104 (8804) all my statutes H2708, and hath done H6213 (8799) them, he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799).
018:020 The soul H5315 that sinneth H2398 (8802), it shall die H4191 (8799). The son H1121 shall not bear H5375 (8799) the iniquity H5771 of the father H0001, neither shall the father H0001 bear H5375 (8799) the iniquity H5771 of the son H1121: the righteousness H6666 of the righteous H6662 shall be upon him, and the wickedness H7564 of the wicked H7563 shall be upon him.
018:021 But if the wicked H7563 will turn H7725 (8799) from all his sins H2403 that he hath committed H6213 (8804), and keep H8104 (8804) all my statutes H2708, and do H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666, he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799), he shall not die H4191 (8799).
018:022 All his transgressions H6588 that he hath committed H6213 (8804), they shall not be mentioned H2142 (8735) unto him: in his righteousness H6666 that he hath done H6213 (8804) he shall live H2421 (8799).
018:023 Have I any pleasure H2654 (8799) at all H2654 (8800) that the wicked H7563 should die H4194? saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: [and] not that he should return H7725 (8800) from his ways H1870, and live H2421 (8804)?
018:024 But when the righteous H6662 turneth away H7725 (8800) from his righteousness H6666, and committeth H6213 (8804) iniquity H5766, [and] doeth H6213 (8799) according to all the abominations H8441 that the wicked H7563 [man] doeth H6213 (8804), shall he live H2425 (8804)? All his righteousness H6666 that he hath done H6213 (8804) shall not be mentioned H2142 (8735): in his trespass H4603 (8804) that he hath trespassed H4604, and in his sin H2403 that he hath sinned H2398 (8804), in them shall he die H4191 (8799).
018:025 Yet ye say H0559 (8804), The way H1870 of the Lord H0136 is not equal H8505 (8735). Hear H8085 (8798) now, O house H1004 of Israel H3478; Is not my way H1870 equal H8505 (8735)? are not your ways H1870 unequal H8505 (8735)?
018:026 When a righteous H6662 [man] turneth away H7725 (8800) from his righteousness H6666, and committeth H6213 (8804) iniquity H5766, and dieth H4191 (8804) in them; for his iniquity H5766 that he hath done H6213 (8804) shall he die H4191 (8799).
018:027 Again, when the wicked H7563 [man] turneth away H7725 (8800) from his wickedness H7564 that he hath committed H6213 (8804), and doeth H6213 (8799) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666, he shall save H2421 his soul H5315 alive H2421 (8762).
018:028 Because he considereth H7200 (8799), and turneth away H7725 (8799) from all his transgressions H6588 that he hath committed H6213 (8804), he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799), he shall not die H4191 (8799).
018:029 Yet saith H0559 (8804) the house H1004 of Israel H3478, The way H1870 of the Lord H0136 is not equal H8505 (8735). O house H1004 of Israel H3478, are not my ways H1870 equal H8505 (8735)? are not your ways H1870 unequal H8505 (8735)?
018:030 Therefore I will judge H8199 (8799) you, O house H1004 of Israel H3478, every one H0376 according to his ways H1870, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069. Repent H7725 (8798), and turn H7725 (8685) [yourselves] from all your transgressions H6588; so iniquity H5771 shall not be your ruin H4383.
018:031 Cast away H7993 (8685) from you all your transgressions H6588, whereby ye have transgressed H6586 (8804); and make H6213 (8798) you a new H2319 heart H3820 and a new H2319 spirit H7307: for why will ye die H4191 (8799), O house H1004 of Israel H3478?
018:032 For I have no pleasure H2654 (8799) in the death H4194 of him that dieth H4191 (8801), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: wherefore turn H7725 (8685) [yourselves], and live H2421 (8798) ye.
019:001 ¶ Moreover take thou up H5375 (8798) a lamentation H7015 for the princes H5387 of Israel H3478,
019:002 And say H0559 (8804), What [is] thy mother H0517? A lioness H3833: she lay down H7257 (8804) among lions H0738, she nourished H7235 (8765) her whelps H1482 among H8432 young lions H3715.
019:003 And she brought up H5927 (8686) one H0259 of her whelps H1482: it became a young lion H3715, and it learned H3925 (8799) to catch H2963 (8800) the prey H2964; it devoured H0398 (8804) men H0120.
019:004 The nations H1471 also heard H8085 (8799) of him; he was taken H8610 (8738) in their pit H7845, and they brought H0935 (8686) him with chains H2397 unto the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
019:005 Now when she saw H7200 (8799) that she had waited H3176 (8738), [and] her hope H8615 was lost H0006 (8804), then she took H3947 (8799) another H0259 of her whelps H1482, [and] made H7760 (8804) him a young lion H3715.
019:006 And he went up and down H1980 (8691) among H8432 the lions H0738, he became a young lion H3715, and learned H3925 (8799) to catch H2963 (8800) the prey H2964, [and] devoured H0398 (8804) men H0120.
019:007 And he knew H3045 (8799) their desolate palaces H0490, and he laid waste H2717 (8689) their cities H5892; and the land H0776 was desolate H3456 (8799), and the fulness H4393 thereof, by the noise H6963 of his roaring H7581.
019:008 Then the nations H1471 set H5414 (8799) against him on every side H5439 from the provinces H4082, and spread H6566 (8799) their net H7568 over him: he was taken H8610 (8738) in their pit H7845.
019:009 And they put H5414 (8799) him in ward H5474 in chains H2397, and brought H0935 (8686) him to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894: they brought H0935 (8686) him into holds H4685, that his voice H6963 should no more be heard H8085 (8735) upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478.
019:010 Thy mother H0517 [is] like a vine H1612 in thy blood H1818 (8676) H1818, planted H8362 (8803) by the waters H4325: she was fruitful H6509 (8802) and full of branches H6058 by reason of many H7227 waters H4325.
019:011 And she had strong H5797 rods H4294 for the sceptres H7626 of them that bare rule H4910 (8802), and her stature H6967 was exalted H1361 (8799) among the thick branches H5688, and she appeared H7200 (8735) in her height H1363 with the multitude H7230 of her branches H1808.
019:012 But she was plucked up H5428 (8714) in fury H2534, she was cast down H7993 (8717) to the ground H0776, and the east H6921 wind H7307 dried up H3001 (8689) her fruit H6529: her strong H5797 rods H4294 were broken H6561 (8694) and withered H3001 (8804); the fire H0784 consumed H0398 (8804) them.
019:013 And now she [is] planted H8362 (8803) in the wilderness H4057, in a dry H6723 and thirsty H6772 ground H0776.
019:014 And fire H0784 is gone out H3318 (8799) of a rod H4294 of her branches H0905, [which] hath devoured H0398 (8804) her fruit H6529, so that she hath no strong H5797 rod H4294 [to be] a sceptre H7626 to rule H4910 (8800). This [is] a lamentation H7015, and shall be for a lamentation H7015.
020:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the seventh H7637 year H8141, in the fifth H2549 [month], the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, [that] certain H0582 of the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8804) to enquire H1875 (8800) of the LORD H3068, and sat H3427 (8799) before H6440 me.
020:002 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
020:003 Son H1121 of man H0120, speak H1696 (8761) unto the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Are ye come H0935 (8802) to enquire H1875 (8800) of me? [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, I will not be enquired H1875 (8735) of by you.
020:004 Wilt thou judge H8199 (8799) them, son H1121 of man H0120, wilt thou judge H8199 (8799) [them]? cause them to know H3045 (8685) the abominations H8441 of their fathers H0001:
020:005 And say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; In the day H3117 when I chose H0977 (8800) Israel H3478, and lifted up H5375 (8799) mine hand H3027 unto the seed H2233 of the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, and made myself known H3045 (8735) unto them in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, when I lifted H5375 (8799) up mine hand H3027 unto them, saying H0559 (8800), I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430;
020:006 In the day H3117 [that] I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 unto them, to bring them forth H3318 (8687) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 into a land H0776 that I had espied H8446 (8804) for them, flowing H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706, which [is] the glory H6643 of all lands H0776:
020:007 Then said H0559 (8799) I unto them, Cast ye away H7993 (8685) every man H0376 the abominations H8251 of his eyes H5869, and defile H2930 (8691) not yourselves with the idols H1544 of Egypt H4714: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
020:008 But they rebelled H4784 (8686) against me, and would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto me: they did not every man H0376 cast away H7993 (8689) the abominations H8251 of their eyes H5869, neither did they forsake H5800 (8804) the idols H1544 of Egypt H4714: then I said H0559 (8799), I will pour out H8210 (8800) my fury H2534 upon them, to accomplish H3615 (8763) my anger H0639 against them in the midst H8432 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
020:009 But I wrought H6213 (8799) for my name’s H8034 sake, that it should not be polluted H2490 (8736) before H5869 the heathen H1471, among H8432 whom they [were], in whose sight H5869 I made myself known H3045 (8738) unto them, in bringing them forth H3318 (8687) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
020:010 Wherefore I caused them to go forth H3318 (8686) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and brought H0935 (8686) them into the wilderness H4057.
020:011 And I gave H5414 (8799) them my statutes H2708, and shewed H3045 (8689) them my judgments H4941, which [if] a man H0120 do H6213 (8799), he shall even live H2425 (8804) in them.
020:012 Moreover also I gave H5414 (8804) them my sabbaths H7676, to be a sign H0226 between me and them, that they might know H3045 (8800) that I [am] the LORD H3068 that sanctify H6942 (8764) them.
020:013 But the house H1004 of Israel H3478 rebelled H4784 (8686) against me in the wilderness H4057: they walked H1980 (8804) not in my statutes H2708, and they despised H3988 (8804) my judgments H4941, which [if] a man H0120 do H6213 (8799), he shall even live H2425 (8804) in them; and my sabbaths H7676 they greatly H3966 polluted H2490 (8765): then I said H0559 (8799), I would pour out H8210 (8800) my fury H2534 upon them in the wilderness H4057, to consume H3615 (8763) them.
020:014 But I wrought H6213 (8799) for my name’s H8034 sake, that it should not be polluted H2490 (8736) before H5869 the heathen H1471, in whose sight H5869 I brought them out H3318 (8689).
020:015 Yet also I lifted up H5375 (8804) my hand H3027 unto them in the wilderness H4057, that I would not bring H0935 (8687) them into the land H0776 which I had given H5414 (8804) [them], flowing H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706, which [is] the glory H6643 of all lands H0776;
020:016 Because they despised H3988 (8804) my judgments H4941, and walked H1980 (8804) not in my statutes H2708, but polluted H2490 (8765) my sabbaths H7676: for their heart H3820 went H1980 (8802) after H0310 their idols H1544.
020:017 Nevertheless mine eye H5869 spared H2347 (8799) them from destroying H7843 (8763) them, neither did I make H6213 (8804) an end H3617 of them in the wilderness H4057.
020:018 But I said H0559 (8799) unto their children H1121 in the wilderness H4057, Walk H3212 (8799) ye not in the statutes H2706 of your fathers H0001, neither observe H8104 (8799) their judgments H4941, nor defile H2930 (8691) yourselves with their idols H1544:
020:019 I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430; walk H3212 (8798) in my statutes H2708, and keep H8104 (8798) my judgments H4941, and do H6213 (8798) them;
020:020 And hallow H6942 (8761) my sabbaths H7676; and they shall be a sign H0226 between me and you, that ye may know H3045 (8800) that I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
020:021 Notwithstanding the children H1121 rebelled H4784 (8686) against me: they walked H1980 (8804) not in my statutes H2708, neither kept H8104 (8804) my judgments H4941 to do H6213 (8800) them, which [if] a man H0120 do H6213 (8799), he shall even live H2425 (8804) in them; they polluted H2490 (8765) my sabbaths H7676: then I said H0559 (8799), I would pour out H8210 (8800) my fury H2534 upon them, to accomplish H3615 (8763) my anger H0639 against them in the wilderness H4057.
020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew H7725 (8689) mine hand H3027, and wrought H6213 (8799) for my name’s H8034 sake, that it should not be polluted H2490 (8736) in the sight H5869 of the heathen H1471, in whose sight H5869 I brought them forth H3318 (8689).
020:023 I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 unto them also in the wilderness H4057, that I would scatter H6327 (8687) them among the heathen H1471, and disperse H2219 (8763) them through the countries H0776;
020:024 Because they had not executed H6213 (8804) my judgments H4941, but had despised H3988 (8804) my statutes H2708, and had polluted H2490 (8765) my sabbaths H7676, and their eyes H5869 were after H0310 their fathers H0001 ’ idols H1544.
020:025 Wherefore I gave H5414 (8804) them also statutes H2706 [that were] not good H2896, and judgments H4941 whereby they should not live H2421 (8799);
020:026 And I polluted H2930 (8762) them in their own gifts H4979, in that they caused to pass through H5674 (8687) [the fire] all that openeth H6363 the womb H7356, that I might make them desolate H8074 (8686), to the end that they might know H3045 (8799) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
020:027 Therefore, son H1121 of man H0120, speak H1696 (8761) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Yet in this your fathers H0001 have blasphemed H1442 (8765) me, in that they have committed H4603 (8800) a trespass H4604 against me.
020:028 [For] when I had brought H0935 (8686) them into the land H0776, [for] the which I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 to give H5414 (8800) it to them, then they saw H7200 (8799) every high H7311 (8802) hill H1389, and all the thick H5687 trees H6086, and they offered H2076 (8799) there their sacrifices H2077, and there they presented H5414 (8799) the provocation H3708 of their offering H7133: there also they made H7760 (8799) their sweet H5207 savour H7381, and poured out H5258 (8686) there their drink offerings H5262.
020:029 Then I said H0559 (8799) unto them, What [is] the high place H1116 whereunto ye go H0935 (8802)? And the name H8034 thereof is called H7121 (8735) Bamah H1117 unto this day H3117.
020:030 Wherefore say H0559 (8798) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Are ye polluted H2930 (8737) after the manner H1870 of your fathers H0001? and commit ye whoredom H2181 (8802) after H0310 their abominations H8251?
020:031 For when ye offer H5375 (8800) your gifts H4979, when ye make your sons H1121 to pass through H5674 (8687) the fire H0784, ye pollute H2930 (8737) yourselves with all your idols H1544, even unto this day H3117: and shall I be enquired H1875 (8735) of by you, O house H1004 of Israel H3478? [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, I will not be enquired H1875 (8735) of by you.
020:032 And that which cometh H5927 (8802) into your mind H7307 shall not be at all, that ye say H0559 (8802), We will be H1961 (8799) as the heathen H1471, as the families H4940 of the countries H0776, to serve H8334 (8763) wood H6086 and stone H0068.
020:033 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, surely with a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and with a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, and with fury H2534 poured out H8210 (8803), will I rule H4427 (8799) over you:
020:034 And I will bring you out H3318 (8689) from the people H5971, and will gather H6908 (8765) you out of the countries H0776 wherein ye are scattered H6327 (8738), with a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and with a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, and with fury H2534 poured out H8210 (8803).
020:035 And I will bring H0935 (8689) you into the wilderness H4057 of the people H5971, and there will I plead H8199 (8738) with you face H6440 to face H6440.
020:036 Like as I pleaded H8199 (8738) with your fathers H0001 in the wilderness H4057 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, so will I plead H8199 (8735) with you, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
020:037 And I will cause you to pass H5674 (8689) under the rod H7626, and I will bring H0935 (8689) you into the bond H4562 of the covenant H1285:
020:038 And I will purge out H1305 (8804) from among you the rebels H4775 (8802), and them that transgress H6586 (8802) against me: I will bring them forth H3318 (8686) out of the country H0776 where they sojourn H4033, and they shall not enter H0935 (8799) into the land H0127 of Israel H3478: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
020:039 As for you, O house H1004 of Israel H3478, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Go H3212 (8798) ye, serve H5647 (8798) ye every one H0376 his idols H1544, and hereafter H0310 [also], if ye will not hearken H8085 (8802) unto me: but pollute H2490 (8762) ye my holy H6944 name H8034 no more with your gifts H4979, and with your idols H1544.
020:040 For in mine holy H6944 mountain H2022, in the mountain H2022 of the height H4791 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, there shall all the house H1004 of Israel H3478, all of them in the land H0776, serve H5647 (8799) me: there will I accept H7521 (8799) them, and there will I require H1875 (8799) your offerings H8641, and the firstfruits H7225 of your oblations H4864, with all your holy things H6944.
020:041 I will accept H7521 (8799) you with your sweet H5207 savour H7381, when I bring you out H3318 (8687) from the people H5971, and gather H6908 (8765) you out of the countries H0776 wherein ye have been scattered H6327 (8738); and I will be sanctified H6942 (8738) in you before H5869 the heathen H1471.
020:042 And ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I shall bring H0935 (8687) you into the land H0127 of Israel H3478, into the country H0776 [for] the which I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 to give H5414 (8800) it to your fathers H0001.
020:043 And there shall ye remember H2142 (8804) your ways H1870, and all your doings H5949, wherein ye have been defiled H2930 (8738); and ye shall lothe H6962 (8738) yourselves in your own sight H6440 for all your evils H7451 that ye have committed H6213 (8804).
020:044 And ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I have wrought H6213 (8800) with you for my name’s H8034 sake, not according to your wicked H7451 ways H1870, nor according to your corrupt H7843 (8737) doings H5949, O ye house H1004 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
020:045 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
020:046 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 toward H1870 the south H8486, and drop H5197 (8685) [thy word] toward the south H1864, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against the forest H3293 of the south H5045 field H7704;
020:047 And say H0559 (8804) to the forest H3293 of the south H5045, Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will kindle H3341 (8688) a fire H0784 in thee, and it shall devour H0398 (8804) every green H3892 tree H6086 in thee, and every dry H3002 tree H6086: the flaming H3852 flame H7957 shall not be quenched H3518 (8799), and all faces H6440 from the south H5045 to the north H6828 shall be burned H6866 (8738) therein.
020:048 And all flesh H1320 shall see H7200 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have kindled H1197 (8765) it: it shall not be quenched H3518 (8799).
020:049 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Ah H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069! they say H0559 (8802) of me, Doth he not speak H4911 (8764) parables H4912?
021:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
021:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 toward Jerusalem H3389, and drop H5197 (8685) [thy word] toward the holy places H4720, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against the land H0127 of Israel H3478,
021:003 And say H0559 (8804) to the land H0127 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I [am] against thee, and will draw forth H3318 (8689) my sword H2719 out of his sheath H8593, and will cut off H3772 (8689) from thee the righteous H6662 and the wicked H7563.
021:004 Seeing H3282 then that I will cut off H3772 (8689) from thee the righteous H6662 and the wicked H7563, therefore shall my sword H2719 go forth H3318 (8799) out of his sheath H8593 against all flesh H1320 from the south H5045 to the north H6828:
021:005 That all flesh H1320 may know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have drawn forth H3318 (8689) my sword H2719 out of his sheath H8593: it shall not return H7725 (8799) any more.
021:006 Sigh H0584 (8734) therefore, thou son H1121 of man H0120, with the breaking H7670 of [thy] loins H4975; and with bitterness H4814 sigh H0584 (8735) before their eyes H5869.
021:007 And it shall be, when they say H0559 (8799) unto thee, Wherefore sighest H0584 (8737) thou? that thou shalt answer H0559 (8804), For the tidings H8052; because it cometh H0935 (8802): and every heart H3820 shall melt H4549 (8738), and all hands H3027 shall be feeble H7503 (8804), and every spirit H7307 shall faint H3543 (8765), and all knees H1290 shall be weak H3212 (8799) [as] water H4325: behold, it cometh H0935 (8802), and shall be brought to pass H1961 (8738), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
021:008 Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
021:009 Son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734), and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Say H0559 (8798), A sword H2719, a sword H2719 is sharpened H2300 (8717), and also furbished H4803 (8803):
021:010 It is sharpened H2300 (8717) to make a sore H2874 slaughter H2873 (8800); it is furbished H4178 (8794) that it may glitter H1300: should H0176 we then make mirth H7797 (8799)? it contemneth H3988 (8802) the rod H7626 of my son H1121, [as] every tree H6086.
021:011 And he hath given H5414 (8799) it to be furbished H4803 (8800), that it may be handled H3709 H8610 (8800): this sword H2719 is sharpened H2300 (8717), and it is furbished H4178 (8794), to give H5414 (8800) it into the hand H3027 of the slayer H2026 (8802).
021:012 Cry H2199 (8798) and howl H3213 (8685), son H1121 of man H0120: for it shall be upon my people H5971, it [shall be] upon all the princes H5387 of Israel H3478: terrors H4048 (8803) by reason of H0413 the sword H2719 shall be upon my people H5971: smite H5606 (8798) therefore upon [thy] thigh H3409.
021:013 Because [it is] a trial H0974 (8795), and what if [the sword] contemn H3988 (8802) even the rod H7626? it shall be no [more], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
021:014 Thou therefore, son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734), and smite H5221 [thine] hands H3709 H3709 together H5221 (8685), and let the sword H2719 be doubled H3717 (8735) the third H7992 time, the sword H2719 of the slain H2491: it [is] the sword H2719 of the great H1419 [men that are] slain H2491, which entereth into their privy chambers H2314 (8802).
021:015 I have set H5414 (8804) the point H0019 of the sword H2719 against all their gates H8179, that [their] heart H3820 may faint H4127 (8800), and [their] ruins H4383 be multiplied H7235 (8687): ah H0253! [it is] made H6213 (8803) bright H1300, [it is] wrapped up H4593 for the slaughter H2874.
021:016 Go thee one way or other H0258 (8690), [either] on H7760 (8685) the right hand H3231 (8685), [or] on the left H8041 (8685), whithersoever H0575 thy face H6440 [is] set H3259 (8716).
021:017 I will also smite H5221 (8686) mine hands H3709 together H3709, and I will cause my fury H2534 to rest H5117 (8689): I the LORD H3068 have said H1696 (8765) [it].
021:018 The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me again, saying H0559 (8800),
021:019 Also, thou son H1121 of man H0120, appoint H7760 (8798) thee two H8147 ways H1870, that the sword H2719 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 may come H0935 (8800): both twain H8147 shall come forth H3318 (8799) out of one H0259 land H0776: and choose H1254 (8761) thou a place H3027, choose H1254 (8761) [it] at the head H7218 of the way H1870 to the city H5892.
021:020 Appoint H7760 (8799) a way H1870, that the sword H2719 may come H0935 (8800) to Rabbath H7237 of the Ammonites H1121 H5983, and to Judah H3063 in Jerusalem H3389 the defenced H1219 (8803).
021:021 For the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 stood H5975 (8804) at the parting H0517 of the way H1870, at the head H7218 of the two H8147 ways H1870, to use H7080 (8800) divination H7081: he made [his] arrows H2671 bright H7043 (8773), he consulted H7592 (8804) with images H8655, he looked H7200 (8804) in the liver H3516.
021:022 At his right hand H3225 was the divination H7081 for Jerusalem H3389, to appoint H7760 (8800) captains H3733, to open H6605 (8800) the mouth H6310 in the slaughter H7524, to lift up H7311 (8687) the voice H6963 with shouting H8643, to appoint H7760 (8800) [battering] rams H3733 against the gates H8179, to cast H8210 (8800) a mount H5550, [and] to build H1129 (8800) a fort H1785.
021:023 And it shall be unto them as a false H7723 divination H7080 (8800) in their sight H5869, to them that have sworn H7650 (8803) oaths H7621: but he will call to remembrance H2142 (8688) the iniquity H5771, that they may be taken H8610 (8736).
021:024 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because ye have made your iniquity H5771 to be remembered H2142 (8687), in that your transgressions H6588 are discovered H1540 (8736), so that in all your doings H5949 your sins H2403 do appear H7200 (8736); because, [I say], that ye are come to remembrance H2142 (8736), ye shall be taken H8610 (8735) with the hand H3709.
021:025 And thou, profane H2491 wicked H7563 prince H5387 of Israel H3478, whose day H3117 is come H0935 (8804), when H6256 iniquity H5771 [shall have] an end H7093,
021:026 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Remove H5493 (8685) the diadem H4701, and take off H7311 (8685) the crown H5850: this [shall] not [be] the same H2063: exalt H1361 (8687) [him that is] low H8217, and abase H8213 (8687) [him that is] high H1364.
021:027 I will overturn H5754, overturn H5754, overturn H5754, it: and it shall be H7760 (8799) no [more], until he come H0935 (8800) whose right H4941 it is; and I will give H5414 (8804) it [him].
021:028 And thou, son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 concerning the Ammonites H1121 H5983, and concerning their reproach H2781; even say H0559 (8804) thou, The sword H2719, the sword H2719 [is] drawn H6605 (8803): for the slaughter H2874 [it is] furbished H4803 (8803), to consume H0398 (8687) because of the glittering H1300:
021:029 Whiles they see H2372 (8800) vanity H7723 unto thee, whiles they divine H7080 (8800) a lie H3577 unto thee, to bring H5414 (8800) thee upon the necks H6677 of [them that are] slain H2491, of the wicked H7563, whose day H3117 is come H0935 (8804), when H6256 their iniquity H5771 [shall have] an end H7093.
021:030 Shall I cause [it] to return H7725 (8685) into his sheath H8593? I will judge H8199 (8799) thee in the place H4725 where thou wast created H1254 (8738), in the land H0776 of thy nativity H4351.
021:031 And I will pour out H8210 (8804) mine indignation H2195 upon thee, I will blow H6315 (8686) against thee in the fire H0784 of my wrath H5678, and deliver H5414 (8804) thee into the hand H3027 of brutish H1197 (8802) men H0582, [and] skilful H2796 to destroy H4889.
021:032 Thou shalt be for fuel H0402 to the fire H0784; thy blood H1818 shall be in the midst H8432 of the land H0776; thou shalt be no [more] remembered H2142 (8735): for I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
022:001 ¶ Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
022:002 Now, thou son H1121 of man H0120, wilt thou judge H8199 (8799), wilt thou judge H8199 (8799) the bloody H1818 city H5892? yea, thou shalt shew H3045 (8689) her all her abominations H8441.
022:003 Then say H0559 (8804) thou, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, The city H5892 sheddeth H8210 (8802) blood H1818 in the midst H8432 of it, that her time H6256 may come H0935 (8800), and maketh H6213 (8804) idols H1544 against herself to defile H2930 (8800) herself.
022:004 Thou art become guilty H0816 (8804) in thy blood H1818 that thou hast shed H8210 (8804); and hast defiled H2930 (8804) thyself in thine idols H1544 which thou hast made H6213 (8804); and thou hast caused thy days H3117 to draw near H7126 (8686), and art come H0935 (8799) [even] unto thy years H8141: therefore have I made H5414 (8804) thee a reproach H2781 unto the heathen H1471, and a mocking H7048 to all countries H0776.
022:005 [Those that be] near H7138, and [those that be] far H7350 from thee, shall mock H7046 (8691) thee, [which art] infamous H2931 H8034 [and] much H7227 vexed H4103.
022:006 Behold, the princes H5387 of Israel H3478, every one H0376 were in thee to their power H2220 to shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818.
022:007 In thee have they set light H7043 (8689) by father H0001 and mother H0517: in the midst H8432 of thee have they dealt H6213 (8804) by oppression H6233 with the stranger H1616: in thee have they vexed H3238 (8689) the fatherless H3490 and the widow H0490.
022:008 Thou hast despised H0959 (8804) mine holy things H6944, and hast profaned H2490 (8765) my sabbaths H7676.
022:009 In thee are men H0582 that carry tales H7400 to shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818: and in thee they eat H0398 (8804) upon the mountains H2022: in the midst H8432 of thee they commit H6213 (8804) lewdness H2154.
022:010 In thee have they discovered H1540 (8765) their fathers H0001 ’ nakedness H6172: in thee have they humbled H6031 (8765) her that was set apart H5079 for pollution H2931.
022:011 And one H0376 hath committed H6213 (8804) abomination H8441 with his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802; and another H0376 hath lewdly H2154 defiled H2930 (8765) his daughter in law H3618; and another H0376 in thee hath humbled H6031 (8765) his sister H0269, his father’s H0001 daughter H1323.
022:012 In thee have they taken H3947 (8804) gifts H7810 to shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818; thou hast taken H3947 (8804) usury H5392 and increase H8636, and thou hast greedily gained H1214 (8762) of thy neighbours H7453 by extortion H6233, and hast forgotten H7911 (8804) me, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
022:013 Behold, therefore I have smitten H5221 (8689) mine hand H3709 at thy dishonest gain H1215 which thou hast made H6213 (8804), and at thy blood H1818 which hath been in the midst H8432 of thee.
022:014 Can thine heart H3820 endure H5975 (8799), or can thine hands H3027 be strong H2388 (8799), in the days H3117 that I shall deal H6213 (8802) with thee? I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], and will do H6213 (8804) [it].
022:015 And I will scatter H6327 (8689) thee among the heathen H1471, and disperse H2219 (8765) thee in the countries H0776, and will consume H8552 (8689) thy filthiness H2932 out of thee.
022:016 And thou shalt take thine inheritance H2490 (8738) (8676) H5157 (8765) in thyself in the sight H5869 of the heathen H1471, and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:017 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
022:018 Son H1121 of man H0120, the house H1004 of Israel H3478 is to me become dross H5509: all they [are] brass H5178, and tin H0913, and iron H1270, and lead H5777, in the midst H8432 of the furnace H3564; they are [even] the dross H5509 of silver H3701.
022:019 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because ye are all become dross H5509, behold, therefore I will gather H6908 (8802) you into the midst H8432 of Jerusalem H3389.
022:020 [As] they gather H6910 silver H3701, and brass H5178, and iron H1270, and lead H5777, and tin H0913, into the midst H8432 of the furnace H3564, to blow H5301 (8800) the fire H0784 upon it, to melt H5413 (8687) [it]; so will I gather H6908 (8799) [you] in mine anger H0639 and in my fury H2534, and I will leave H3240 (8689) [you there], and melt H5413 (8689) you.
022:021 Yea, I will gather H3664 (8765) you, and blow H5301 (8804) upon you in the fire H0784 of my wrath H5678, and ye shall be melted H5413 (8738) in the midst H8432 thereof.
022:022 As silver H3701 is melted H2046 in the midst H8432 of the furnace H3564, so shall ye be melted H5413 (8714) in the midst H8432 thereof; and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have poured out H8210 (8804) my fury H2534 upon you.
022:023 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
022:024 Son H1121 of man H0120, say H0559 (8798) unto her, Thou [art] the land H0776 that is not cleansed H2891 (8794), nor rained H1656 upon in the day H3117 of indignation H2195.
022:025 [There is] a conspiracy H7195 of her prophets H5030 in the midst H8432 thereof, like a roaring H7580 (8802) lion H0738 ravening H2963 (8802) the prey H2964; they have devoured H0398 (8804) souls H5315; they have taken H3947 (8799) the treasure H2633 and precious things H3366; they have made her many H7235 (8689) widows H0490 in the midst H8432 thereof.
022:026 Her priests H3548 have violated H2554 (8804) my law H8451, and have profaned H2490 (8762) mine holy things H6944: they have put no difference H0914 (8689) between the holy H6944 and profane H2455, neither have they shewed H3045 (8689) [difference] between the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889, and have hid H5956 (8689) their eyes H5869 from my sabbaths H7676, and I am profaned H2490 (8735) among H8432 them.
022:027 Her princes H8269 in the midst H7130 thereof [are] like wolves H2061 ravening H2963 (8802) the prey H2964, to shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818, [and] to destroy H0006 (8763) souls H5315, to get H1214 (8800) dishonest gain H1215.
022:028 And her prophets H5030 have daubed H2902 (8804) them with untempered H8602 [morter], seeing H2374 vanity H7723, and divining H7080 (8802) lies H3577 unto them, saying H0559 (8802), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, when the LORD H3068 hath not spoken H1696 (8765).
022:029 The people H5971 of the land H0776 have used oppression H6231 (8804) H6233, and exercised H1497 (8804) robbery H1498, and have vexed H3238 (8689) the poor H6041 and needy H0034: yea, they have oppressed H6231 (8804) the stranger H1616 wrongfully H4941.
022:030 And I sought H1245 (8762) for a man H0376 among them, that should make up H1443 (8802) the hedge H1447, and stand H5975 (8802) in the gap H6556 before H6440 me for the land H0776, that I should not destroy H7843 (8763) it: but I found H4672 (8804) none.
022:031 Therefore have I poured out H8210 (8799) mine indignation H2195 upon them; I have consumed H3615 (8765) them with the fire H0784 of my wrath H5678: their own way H1870 have I recompensed H5414 (8804) upon their heads H7218, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
023:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
023:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, there were two H8147 women H0802, the daughters H1323 of one H0259 mother H0517:
023:003 And they committed whoredoms H2181 (8799) in Egypt H4714; they committed whoredoms H2181 (8804) in their youth H5271: there were their breasts H7699 pressed H4600 (8795), and there they bruised H6213 (8765) the teats H1717 of their virginity H1331.
023:004 And the names H8034 of them [were] Aholah H0170 the elder H1419, and Aholibah H0172 her sister H0269: and they were mine, and they bare H3205 (8799) sons H1121 and daughters H1323. Thus [were] their names H8034; Samaria H8111 [is] Aholah H0170, and Jerusalem H3389 Aholibah H0172.
023:005 And Aholah H0170 played the harlot H2181 (8799) when she was mine H8478; and she doted H5689 (8799) on her lovers H0157 (8764), on the Assyrians H0804 [her] neighbours H7138,
023:006 [Which were] clothed H3847 (8803) with blue H8504, captains H6346 and rulers H5461, all of them desirable H2531 young men H0970, horsemen H6571 riding H7392 (8802) upon horses H5483.
023:007 Thus she committed H5414 (8799) her whoredoms H8457 with them, with all them [that were] the chosen H4005 men H1121 of Assyria H0804, and with all on whom she doted H5689 (8804): with all their idols H1544 she defiled H2930 (8738) herself.
023:008 Neither left H5800 (8804) she her whoredoms H8457 [brought] from Egypt H4714: for in her youth H5271 they lay H7901 (8804) with her, and they bruised H6213 (8765) the breasts H1717 of her virginity H1331, and poured H8210 (8799) their whoredom H8457 upon her.
023:009 Wherefore I have delivered H5414 (8804) her into the hand H3027 of her lovers H0157 (8764), into the hand H3027 of the Assyrians H1121 H0804, upon whom she doted H5689 (8804).
023:010 These discovered H1540 (8765) her nakedness H6172: they took H3947 (8804) her sons H1121 and her daughters H1323, and slew H2026 (8804) her with the sword H2719: and she became famous H8034 among women H0802; for they had executed H6213 (8804) judgment H8196 upon her.
023:011 And when her sister H0269 Aholibah H0172 saw H7200 (8799) [this], she was more corrupt H7843 (8686) in her inordinate love H5691 than she, and in her whoredoms H8457 more than her sister H0269 in [her] whoredoms H2183.
023:012 She doted H5689 (8804) upon the Assyrians H1121 H0804 [her] neighbours H7138, captains H6346 and rulers H5461 clothed H3847 (8803) most gorgeously H4358, horsemen H6571 riding H7392 (8802) upon horses H5483, all of them desirable H2531 young men H0970.
023:013 Then I saw H7200 (8799) that she was defiled H2930 (8738), [that] they [took] both H8147 one H0259 way H1870,
023:014 And [that] she increased H3254 (8686) her whoredoms H8457: for when she saw H7200 (8799) men H0582 pourtrayed H2707 (8794) upon the wall H7023, the images H6754 of the Chaldeans H3778 pourtrayed H2710 (8803) with vermilion H8350,
023:015 Girded H2289 with girdles H0232 upon their loins H4975, exceeding H5628 (8803) in dyed attire H2871 upon their heads H7218, all of them princes H7991 to look to H4758, after the manner H1823 of the Babylonians H1121 H0894 of Chaldea H3778, the land H0776 of their nativity H4138:
023:016 And as soon as she saw H4758 them with her eyes H5869, she doted H5689 (8799) upon them, and sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto them into Chaldea H3778.
023:017 And the Babylonians H1121 H0894 came H0935 (8799) to her into the bed H4904 of love H1730, and they defiled H2930 (8762) her with their whoredom H8457, and she was polluted H2930 (8799) with them, and her mind H5315 was alienated H3363 (8799) from them.
023:018 So she discovered H1540 (8762) her whoredoms H8457, and discovered H1540 (8762) her nakedness H6172: then my mind H5315 was alienated H3363 (8799) from her, like as my mind H5315 was alienated H5361 (8804) from her sister H0269.
023:019 Yet she multiplied H7235 (8686) her whoredoms H8457, in calling to remembrance H2142 (8800) the days H3117 of her youth H5271, wherein she had played the harlot H2181 (8804) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
023:020 For she doted H5689 (8799) upon their paramours H6370, whose flesh H1320 [is as] the flesh H1320 of asses H2543, and whose issue H2231 [is like] the issue H2231 of horses H5483.
023:021 Thus thou calledst to remembrance H6485 (8799) the lewdness H2154 of thy youth H5271, in bruising H6213 (8800) thy teats H1717 by the Egyptians H4714 for the paps H7699 of thy youth H5271.
023:022 Therefore, O Aholibah H0172, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will raise up H5782 (8688) thy lovers H0157 (8764) against thee, from whom thy mind H5315 is alienated H5361 (8804), and I will bring H0935 (8689) them against thee on every side H5439;
023:023 The Babylonians H1121 H0894, and all the Chaldeans H3778, Pekod H6489, and Shoa H7772, and Koa H6970, [and] all the Assyrians H1121 H0804 with them: all of them desirable H2531 young men H0970, captains H6346 and rulers H5461, great lords H7991 and renowned H7121 (8803), all of them riding H7392 (8802) upon horses H5483.
023:024 And they shall come H0935 (8804) against thee with chariots H2021, wagons H7393, and wheels H1534, and with an assembly H6951 of people H5971, [which] shall set H7760 (8799) against thee buckler H6793 and shield H4043 and helmet H6959 round about H5439: and I will set H5414 (8804) judgment H4941 before H6440 them, and they shall judge H8199 (8804) thee according to their judgments H4941.
023:025 And I will set H5414 (8804) my jealousy H7068 against thee, and they shall deal H6213 (8804) furiously H2534 with thee: they shall take away H5493 (8686) thy nose H0639 and thine ears H0241; and thy remnant H0319 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719: they shall take H3947 (8799) thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323; and thy residue H0319 shall be devoured H0398 (8735) by the fire H0784.
023:026 They shall also strip H6584 (8689) thee out of thy clothes H0899, and take away H3947 (8804) thy fair H8597 jewels H3627.
023:027 Thus will I make thy lewdness H2154 to cease H7673 (8689) from thee, and thy whoredom H2184 [brought] from the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: so that thou shalt not lift up H5375 (8799) thine eyes H5869 unto them, nor remember H2142 (8799) Egypt H4714 any more.
023:028 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will deliver H5414 (8802) thee into the hand H3027 [of them] whom thou hatest H8130 (8804), into the hand H3027 [of them] from whom thy mind H5315 is alienated H5361 (8804):
023:029 And they shall deal H6213 (8804) with thee hatefully H8135, and shall take away H3947 (8804) all thy labour H3018, and shall leave H5800 (8804) thee naked H5903 and bare H6181: and the nakedness H6172 of thy whoredoms H2183 shall be discovered H1540 (8738), both thy lewdness H2154 and thy whoredoms H8457.
023:030 I will do H6213 (8800) these [things] unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring H2181 (8800) after H0310 the heathen H1471, [and] because thou art polluted H2930 (8738) with their idols H1544.
023:031 Thou hast walked H1980 (8804) in the way H1870 of thy sister H0269; therefore will I give H5414 (8804) her cup H3563 into thine hand H3027.
023:032 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Thou shalt drink H8354 (8799) of thy sister’s H0269 cup H3563 deep H6013 and large H7342: thou shalt be laughed to scorn H6712 and had in derision H3933; it containeth H3557 (8687) much H4767.
023:033 Thou shalt be filled H4390 (8735) with drunkenness H7943 and sorrow H3015, with the cup H3563 of astonishment H8047 and desolation H8077, with the cup H3563 of thy sister H0269 Samaria H8111.
023:034 Thou shalt even drink H8354 (8804) it and suck [it] out H4680 (8804), and thou shalt break H1633 (8762) the sherds H2789 thereof, and pluck off H5423 (8762) thine own breasts H7699: for I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
023:035 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thou hast forgotten H7911 (8804) me, and cast H7993 (8686) me behind H0310 thy back H1458, therefore bear H5375 (8798) thou also thy lewdness H2154 and thy whoredoms H8457.
023:036 The LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) moreover unto me; Son H1121 of man H0120, wilt thou judge H8199 (8799) Aholah H0170 and Aholibah H0172? yea, declare H5046 (8685) unto them their abominations H8441;
023:037 That they have committed adultery H5003 (8765), and blood H1818 [is] in their hands H3027, and with their idols H1544 have they committed adultery H5003 (8765), and have also caused their sons H1121, whom they bare H3205 (8804) unto me, to pass for them through H5674 (8689) [the fire], to devour H0402 [them].
023:038 Moreover this they have done H6213 (8804) unto me: they have defiled H2930 (8765) my sanctuary H4720 in the same day H3117, and have profaned H2490 (8765) my sabbaths H7676.
023:039 For when they had slain H7819 (8800) their children H1121 to their idols H1544, then they came H0935 (8799) the same day H3117 into my sanctuary H4720 to profane H2490 (8763) it; and, lo, thus have they done H6213 (8804) in the midst H8432 of mine house H1004.
023:040 And furthermore H0637, that ye have sent H7971 (8799) for men H0582 to come H0935 (8802) from far H4801, unto whom a messenger H4397 [was] sent H7971 (8803); and, lo, they came H0935 (8804): for whom thou didst wash H7364 (8804) thyself, paintedst H3583 (8804) thy eyes H5869, and deckedst H5710 (8804) thyself with ornaments H5716,
023:041 And satest H3427 (8804) upon a stately H3520 bed H4296, and a table H7979 prepared H6186 (8803) before H6440 it, whereupon thou hast set H7760 (8804) mine incense H7004 and mine oil H8081.
023:042 And a voice H6963 of a multitude H1995 being at ease H7961 [was] with her: and with the men H0582 of the common sort H7230 H0120 [were] brought H0935 (8716) Sabeans H5436 (8675) H5433 (8802) from the wilderness H4057, which put H5414 (8799) bracelets H6781 upon their hands H3027, and beautiful H8597 crowns H5850 upon their heads H7218.
023:043 Then said H0559 (8799) I unto [her that was] old H1087 in adulteries H5004, Will they now commit H2181 (8799) whoredoms H8457 with her, and she [with them]?
023:044 Yet they went in H0935 (8799) unto her, as they go in H0935 (8800) unto a woman H0802 that playeth the harlot H2181 (8802): so went they in H0935 (8804) unto Aholah H0170 and unto Aholibah H0172, the lewd H2154 women H0802.
023:045 And the righteous H6662 men H0582, they shall judge H8199 (8799) them after the manner H4941 of adulteresses H5003 (8802), and after the manner H4941 of women that shed H8210 (8802) blood H1818; because they [are] adulteresses H5003 (8802), and blood H1818 [is] in their hands H3027.
023:046 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will bring up H5927 (8687) a company H6951 upon them, and will give H5414 (8800) them to be removed H2189 and spoiled H0957.
023:047 And the company H6951 shall stone H7275 (8804) them with stones H0068, and dispatch H1254 (8763) them with their swords H2719; they shall slay H2026 (8799) their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323, and burn up H8313 (8799) their houses H1004 with fire H0784.
023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness H2154 to cease H7673 (8689) out of the land H0776, that all women H0802 may be taught H3256 (8739) not to do H6213 (8799) after your lewdness H2154.
023:049 And they shall recompense H5414 (8804) your lewdness H2154 upon you, and ye shall bear H5375 (8799) the sins H2399 of your idols H1544: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
024:001 ¶ Again in the ninth H8671 year H8141, in the tenth H6224 month H2320, in the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
024:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, write H3789 (8798) thee the name H8034 of the day H3117, [even] of this same H6106 day H3117: the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 set H5564 (8804) himself against Jerusalem H3389 this same H6106 day H3117.
024:003 And utter H4911 (8798) a parable H4912 unto the rebellious H4805 house H1004, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Set on H8239 (8798) a pot H5518, set [it] on H8239 (8798), and also pour H3332 (8798) water H4325 into it:
024:004 Gather H0622 (8798) the pieces H5409 thereof into it, [even] every good H2896 piece H5409, the thigh H3409, and the shoulder H3802; fill H4390 (8761) [it] with the choice H4005 bones H6106.
024:005 Take H3947 (8800) the choice H4005 of the flock H6629, and burn H1754 also the bones H6106 under it, [and] make it boil H7570 (8761) well H7571, and let them seethe H1310 (8804) the bones H6106 of it therein H8432.
024:006 Wherefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Woe H0188 to the bloody H1818 city H5892, to the pot H5518 whose scum H2457 [is] therein, and whose scum H2457 is not gone out H3318 (8804) of it! bring it out H3318 (8685) piece H5409 by piece H5409; let no lot H1486 fall H5307 (8804) upon it.
024:007 For her blood H1818 is in the midst H8432 of her; she set H7760 (8804) it upon the top H6706 of a rock H5553; she poured H8210 (8804) it not upon the ground H0776, to cover H3680 (8763) it with dust H6083;
024:008 That it might cause fury H2534 to come up H5927 (8687) to take H5358 (8800) vengeance H5359; I have set H5414 (8804) her blood H1818 upon the top H6706 of a rock H5553, that it should not be covered H3680 (8736).
024:009 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Woe H0188 to the bloody H1818 city H5892! I will even make the pile H4071 for fire great H1431 (8686).
024:010 Heap H7235 (8685) on wood H6086, kindle H1814 (8687) the fire H0784, consume H8552 (8687) the flesh H1320, and spice H7543 (8687) it well H4841, and let the bones H6106 be burned H2787 (8735).
024:011 Then set H5975 (8687) it empty H7386 upon the coals H1513 thereof, that the brass H5178 of it may be hot H3179 (8799), and may burn H2787 (8804), and [that] the filthiness H2932 of it may be molten H5413 (8738) in it H8432, [that] the scum H2457 of it may be consumed H8552 (8799).
024:012 She hath wearied H3811 (8689) [herself] with lies H8383, and her great H7227 scum H2457 went not forth H3318 (8799) out of her: her scum H2457 [shall be] in the fire H0784.
024:013 In thy filthiness H2932 [is] lewdness H2154: because I have purged H2891 (8765) thee, and thou wast not purged H2891 (8804), thou shalt not be purged H2891 (8799) from thy filthiness H2932 any more, till I have caused my fury H2534 to rest H5117 (8687) upon thee.
024:014 I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it]: it shall come to pass H0935 (8802), and I will do H6213 (8804) [it]; I will not go back H6544 (8799), neither will I spare H2347 (8799), neither will I repent H5162 (8735); according to thy ways H1870, and according to thy doings H5949, shall they judge H8199 (8804) thee, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
024:015 Also the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
024:016 Son H1121 of man H0120, behold, I take away H3947 (8802) from thee the desire H4261 of thine eyes H5869 with a stroke H4046: yet neither shalt thou mourn H5594 (8799) nor weep H1058 (8799), neither shall thy tears H1832 run down H0935 (8799).
024:017 Forbear H1826 (8798) to cry H0602 (8736), make H6213 (8799) no mourning H0060 for the dead H4191 (8801), bind H2280 (8798) the tire of thine head H6287 upon thee, and put on H7760 (8799) thy shoes H5275 upon thy feet H7272, and cover H5844 (8799) not [thy] lips H8222, and eat H0398 (8799) not the bread H3899 of men H0582.
024:018 So I spake H1696 (8762) unto the people H5971 in the morning H1242: and at even H6153 my wife H0802 died H4191 (8799); and I did H6213 (8799) in the morning H1242 as I was commanded H6680 (8795).
024:019 And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Wilt thou not tell H5046 (8686) us what these [things are] to us, that thou doest H6213 (8802) [so]?
024:020 Then I answered H0559 (8799) them, The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
024:021 Speak H0559 (8798) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will profane H2490 (8764) my sanctuary H4720, the excellency H1347 of your strength H5797, the desire H4261 of your eyes H5869, and that which your soul H5315 pitieth H4263; and your sons H1121 and your daughters H1323 whom ye have left H5800 (8804) shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719.
024:022 And ye shall do H6213 (8804) as I have done H6213 (8804): ye shall not cover H5844 (8799) [your] lips H8222, nor eat H0398 (8799) the bread H3899 of men H0582.
024:023 And your tires H6287 [shall be] upon your heads H7218, and your shoes H5275 upon your feet H7272: ye shall not mourn H5594 (8799) nor weep H1058 (8799); but ye shall pine away H4743 (8738) for your iniquities H5771, and mourn H5098 (8804) one H0376 toward another H0251.
024:024 Thus Ezekiel H3168 is unto you a sign H4159: according to all that he hath done H6213 (8804) shall ye do H6213 (8799): and when this cometh H0935 (8800), ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
024:025 Also, thou son H1121 of man H0120, [shall it] not [be] in the day H3117 when I take H3947 (8800) from them their strength H4581, the joy H4885 of their glory H8597, the desire H4261 of their eyes H5869, and that whereupon they set H4853 their minds H5315, their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323,
024:026 [That] he that escapeth H6412 in that day H3117 shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee, to cause [thee] to hear H2045 [it] with [thine] ears H0241?
024:027 In that day H3117 shall thy mouth H6310 be opened H6605 (8735) to him which is escaped H6412, and thou shalt speak H1696 (8762), and be no more dumb H0481 (8735): and thou shalt be a sign H4159 unto them; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
025:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
025:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against the Ammonites H1121 H5983, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against them;
025:003 And say H0559 (8804) unto the Ammonites H1121 H5983, Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thou saidst H0559 (8800), Aha H1889, against my sanctuary H4720, when it was profaned H2490 (8738); and against the land H0127 of Israel H3478, when it was desolate H8074 (8738); and against the house H1004 of Judah H3063, when they went H1980 (8804) into captivity H1473;
025:004 Behold, therefore I will deliver H5414 (8802) thee to the men H1121 of the east H6924 for a possession H4181, and they shall set H3427 (8765) their palaces H2918 in thee, and make H5414 (8804) their dwellings H4908 in thee: they shall eat H0398 (8799) thy fruit H6529, and they shall drink H8354 (8799) thy milk H2461.
025:005 And I will make H5414 (8804) Rabbah H7237 a stable H5116 for camels H1581, and the Ammonites H1121 H5983 a couchingplace H4769 for flocks H6629: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
025:006 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thou hast clapped H4222 (8763) [thine] hands H3027, and stamped H7554 (8800) with the feet H7272, and rejoiced H8055 (8799) in heart H5315 with all thy despite H7589 against the land H0127 of Israel H3478;
025:007 Behold, therefore I will stretch out H5186 (8804) mine hand H3027 upon thee, and will deliver H5414 (8804) thee for a spoil H0957 (8675) H0897 to the heathen H1471; and I will cut thee off H3772 (8689) from the people H5971, and I will cause thee to perish H0006 (8689) out of the countries H0776: I will destroy H8045 (8686) thee; and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
025:008 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because H3282 that Moab H4124 and Seir H8165 do say H0559 (8800), Behold, the house H1004 of Judah H3063 [is] like unto all the heathen H1471;
025:009 Therefore, behold, I will open H6605 (8802) the side H3802 of Moab H4124 from the cities H5892, from his cities H5892 [which are] on his frontiers H7097, the glory H6643 of the country H0776, Bethjeshimoth H1020, Baalmeon H1186, and Kiriathaim H7156,
025:010 Unto the men H1121 of the east H6924 with the Ammonites H1121 H5983, and will give H5414 (8804) them in possession H4181, that the Ammonites H1121 H5983 may not be remembered H2142 (8735) among the nations H1471.
025:011 And I will execute H6213 (8799) judgments H8201 upon Moab H4124; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
025:012 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because that Edom H0123 hath dealt H6213 (8800) against the house H1004 of Judah H3063 by taking H5358 (8800) vengeance H5359, and hath greatly H0816 (8800) offended H0816 (8799), and revenged H5358 (8738) himself upon them;
025:013 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will also stretch out H5186 (8804) mine hand H3027 upon Edom H0123, and will cut off H3772 (8689) man H0120 and beast H0929 from it; and I will make H5414 (8804) it desolate H2723 from Teman H8487; and they of Dedan H1719 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719.
025:014 And I will lay H5414 (8804) my vengeance H5360 upon Edom H0123 by the hand H3027 of my people H5971 Israel H3478: and they shall do H6213 (8804) in Edom H0123 according to mine anger H0639 and according to my fury H2534; and they shall know H3045 (8804) my vengeance H5360, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
025:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because the Philistines H6430 have dealt H6213 (8800) by revenge H5360, and have taken H5358 (8735) vengeance H5359 with a despiteful H7589 heart H5315, to destroy H4889 [it] for the old H5769 hatred H0342;
025:016 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will stretch out H5186 (8802) mine hand H3027 upon the Philistines H6430, and I will cut off H3772 (8689) the Cherethims H3774, and destroy H0006 (8689) the remnant H7611 of the sea H3220 coast H2348.
025:017 And I will execute H6213 (8804) great H1419 vengeance H5360 upon them with furious H2534 rebukes H8433; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I shall lay H5414 (8800) my vengeance H5360 upon them.
026:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the eleventh H6249 H6240 year H8141, in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, [that] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
026:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, because that Tyrus H6865 hath said H0559 (8804) against Jerusalem H3389, Aha H1889, she is broken H7665 (8738) [that was] the gates H1817 of the people H5971: she is turned H5437 (8738) unto me: I shall be replenished H4390 (8735), [now] she is laid waste H2717 (8717):
026:003 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Tyrus H6865, and will cause many H7227 nations H1471 to come up H5927 (8689) against thee, as the sea H3220 causeth his waves H1530 to come up H5927 (8687).
026:004 And they shall destroy H7843 (8765) the walls H2346 of Tyrus H6865, and break down H2040 (8804) her towers H4026: I will also scrape H5500 (8765) her dust H6083 from her, and make H5414 (8804) her like the top H6706 of a rock H5553.
026:005 It shall be [a place for] the spreading H4894 of nets H2764 in the midst H8432 of the sea H3220: for I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: and it shall become a spoil H0957 to the nations H1471.
026:006 And her daughters H1323 which [are] in the field H7704 shall be slain H2026 (8735) by the sword H2719; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
026:007 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) upon Tyrus H6865 Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, a king H4428 of kings H4428, from the north H6828, with horses H5483, and with chariots H7393, and with horsemen H6571, and companies H6951, and much H7227 people H5971.
026:008 He shall slay H2026 (8799) with the sword H2719 thy daughters H1323 in the field H7704: and he shall make H5414 (8804) a fort H1785 against thee, and cast H8210 (8804) a mount H5550 against thee, and lift up H6965 (8689) the buckler H6793 against thee.
026:009 And he shall set H5414 (8799) engines H4239 of war H6904 against thy walls H2346, and with his axes H2719 he shall break down H5422 (8799) thy towers H4026.
026:010 By reason of the abundance H8229 of his horses H5483 their dust H0080 shall cover H3680 (8762) thee: thy walls H2346 shall shake H7493 (8799) at the noise H6963 of the horsemen H6571, and of the wheels H1534, and of the chariots H7393, when he shall enter H0935 (8800) into thy gates H8179, as men enter H3996 into a city H5892 wherein is made a breach H1234 (8794).
026:011 With the hoofs H6541 of his horses H5483 shall he tread down H7429 (8799) all thy streets H2351: he shall slay H2026 (8799) thy people H5971 by the sword H2719, and thy strong H5797 garrisons H4676 shall go down H3381 (8799) to the ground H0776.
026:012 And they shall make a spoil H7997 (8804) of thy riches H2428, and make a prey H0962 (8804) of thy merchandise H7404: and they shall break down H2040 (8804) thy walls H2346, and destroy H5422 (8799) thy pleasant H2532 houses H1004: and they shall lay H7760 (8799) thy stones H0068 and thy timber H6086 and thy dust H6083 in the midst H8432 of the water H4325.
026:013 And I will cause the noise H1995 of thy songs H7892 to cease H7673 (8689); and the sound H6963 of thy harps H3658 shall be no more heard H8085 (8735).
026:014 And I will make H5414 (8804) thee like the top H6706 of a rock H5553: thou shalt be [a place] to spread H4894 nets H2764 upon H4894; thou shalt be built H1129 (8735) no more: for I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
026:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 to Tyrus H6865; Shall not the isles H0339 shake H7493 (8799) at the sound H6963 of thy fall H4658, when the wounded H2491 cry H0602 (8800), when the slaughter H2027 is made H2026 (8736) in the midst H8432 of thee?
026:016 Then all the princes H5387 of the sea H3220 shall come down H3381 (8804) from their thrones H3678, and lay away H5493 (8689) their robes H4598, and put off H6584 (8799) their broidered H7553 garments H0899: they shall clothe H3847 (8799) themselves with trembling H2731; they shall sit H3427 (8799) upon the ground H0776, and shall tremble H2729 (8804) at [every] moment H7281, and be astonished H8074 (8804) at thee.
026:017 And they shall take up H5375 (8804) a lamentation H7015 for thee, and say H0559 (8804) to thee, How art thou destroyed H0006 (8804), [that wast] inhabited H3427 (8737) of seafaring men H3220, the renowned H1984 (8794) city H5892, which wast strong H2389 in the sea H3220, she and her inhabitants H3427 (8802), which cause H5414 (8804) their terror H2851 [to be] on all that haunt H3427 (8802) it!
026:018 Now shall the isles H0339 tremble H2729 (8799) in the day H3117 of thy fall H4658; yea, the isles H0339 that [are] in the sea H3220 shall be troubled H0926 (8738) at thy departure H3318 (8800).
026:019 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; When I shall make H5414 (8800) thee a desolate H2717 (8737) city H5892, like the cities H5892 that are not inhabited H3427 (8738); when I shall bring up H5927 (8687) the deep H8415 upon thee, and great H7227 waters H4325 shall cover H3680 (8765) thee;
026:020 When I shall bring thee down H3381 (8689) with them that descend H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953, with the people H5971 of old time H5769, and shall set H3427 (8689) thee in the low parts H8482 of the earth H0776, in places desolate H2723 of old H5769, with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953, that thou be not inhabited H3427 (8799); and I shall set H5414 (8804) glory H6643 in the land H0776 of the living H2416;
026:021 I will make H5414 (8799) thee a terror H1091, and thou [shalt be] no [more]: though thou be sought for H1245 (8792), yet shalt thou never H5769 be found H4672 (8735) again, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
027:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
027:002 Now, thou son H1121 of man H0120, take up H5375 (8798) a lamentation H7015 for Tyrus H6865;
027:003 And say H0559 (8804) unto Tyrus H6865, O thou that art situate H3427 (8802) at the entry H3997 of the sea H3220, [which art] a merchant H7402 (8802) of the people H5971 for many H7227 isles H0339, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; O Tyrus H6865, thou hast said H0559 (8804), I [am] of perfect H3632 beauty H3308.
027:004 Thy borders H1366 [are] in the midst H3820 of the seas H3220, thy builders H1129 (8802) have perfected H3634 (8804) thy beauty H3308.
027:005 They have made H1129 (8804) all thy [ship] boards H3871 of fir trees H1265 of Senir H8149: they have taken H3947 (8804) cedars H0730 from Lebanon H3844 to make H6213 (8800) masts H8650 for thee.
027:006 [Of] the oaks H0437 of Bashan H1316 have they made H6213 (8804) thine oars H4880; the company H1323 of the Ashurites H0839 have made H6213 (8804) thy benches H7175 [of] ivory H8127, [brought] out of the isles H0339 of Chittim H3794.
027:007 Fine linen H8336 with broidered work H7553 from Egypt H4714 was that which thou spreadest forth H4666 to be thy sail H5251; blue H8504 and purple H0713 from the isles H0339 of Elishah H0473 was that which covered H4374 thee.
027:008 The inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Zidon H6721 and Arvad H0719 were thy mariners H7751 (8801): thy wise H2450 [men], O Tyrus H6865, [that] were in thee, were thy pilots H2259.
027:009 The ancients H2205 of Gebal H1380 and the wise H2450 [men] thereof were in thee thy calkers H0919 H2388 (8688): all the ships H0591 of the sea H3220 with their mariners H4419 were in thee to occupy H6148 (8800) thy merchandise H4627.
027:010 They of Persia H6539 and of Lud H3865 and of Phut H6316 were in thine army H2428, thy men H0582 of war H4421: they hanged H8518 (8765) the shield H4043 and helmet H3553 in thee; they set forth H5414 (8804) thy comeliness H1926.
027:011 The men H1121 of Arvad H0719 with thine army H2428 [were] upon thy walls H2346 round about H5439, and the Gammadims H1575 were in thy towers H4026: they hanged H8518 (8765) their shields H7982 upon thy walls H2346 round about H5439; they have made H3634 thy beauty H3308 perfect H3634 (8804).
027:012 Tarshish H8659 [was] thy merchant H5503 (8802) by reason of the multitude H7230 of all [kind of] riches H1952; with silver H3701, iron H1270, tin H0913, and lead H5777, they traded H5414 (8804) in thy fairs H5801.

027:016 Syria H0758 [was] thy merchant H5503 (8802) by reason of the multitude H7230 of the wares of thy making H4639: they occupied H5414 (8804) in thy fairs H5801 with emeralds H5306, purple H0713, and broidered work H7553, and fine linen H0948, and coral H7215, and agate H3539.
027:017 Judah H3063, and the land H0776 of Israel H3478, they [were] thy merchants H7402 (8802): they traded H5414 (8804) in thy market H4627 wheat H2406 of Minnith H4511, and Pannag H6436, and honey H1706, and oil H8081, and balm H6875.
027:018 Damascus H1834 [was] thy merchant H5503 (8802) in the multitude H7230 of the wares of thy making H4639, for the multitude H7230 of all riches H1952; in the wine H3196 of Helbon H2463, and white H6713 wool H6785.
027:019 Dan H2051 (8676) H1835 also and Javan H3120 going to and fro H0235 (8794) occupied H5414 (8804) in thy fairs H5801: bright H6219 iron H1270, cassia H6916, and calamus H7070, were in thy market H4627.
027:020 Dedan H1719 [was] thy merchant H7402 (8802) in precious H2667 clothes H0899 for chariots H7396.
027:021 Arabia H6152, and all the princes H5387 of Kedar H6938, they occupied H5503 with thee H3027 in lambs H3733, and rams H0352, and goats H6260: in these [were they] thy merchants H5503 (8802).
027:022 The merchants H7402 (8802) of Sheba H7614 and Raamah H7484, they [were] thy merchants H7402 (8802): they occupied H5414 (8804) in thy fairs H5801 with chief H7218 of all spices H1314, and with all precious H3368 stones H0068, and gold H2091.
027:023 Haran H2771, and Canneh H3656, and Eden H5729, the merchants H7402 (8802) of Sheba H7614, Asshur H0804, [and] Chilmad H3638, [were] thy merchants H7402 (8802).
027:024 These [were] thy merchants H7402 (8802) in all sorts H4360 [of things], in blue H8504 clothes H1545, and broidered work H7553, and in chests H1595 of rich apparel H1264, bound H2280 (8803) with cords H2256, and made of cedar H0729, among thy merchandise H4819.
027:025 The ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659 did sing H7788 (8802) of thee in thy market H4627: and thou wast replenished H4390 (8735), and made very H3966 glorious H3513 (8799) in the midst H3820 of the seas H3220.
027:026 Thy rowers H7751 (8801) have brought H0935 (8689) thee into great H7227 waters H4325: the east H6921 wind H7307 hath broken H7665 (8804) thee in the midst H3820 of the seas H3220.
027:027 Thy riches H1952, and thy fairs H5801, thy merchandise H4627, thy mariners H4419, and thy pilots H2259, thy calkers H0919 H2388 (8688), and the occupiers H6148 (8802) of thy merchandise H4627, and all thy men H0582 of war H4421, that [are] in thee, and in all thy company H6951 which [is] in the midst H8432 of thee, shall fall H5307 (8799) into the midst H3820 of the seas H3220 in the day H3117 of thy ruin H4658.
027:028 The suburbs H4054 shall shake H7493 (8799) at the sound H6963 of the cry H2201 of thy pilots H2259.
027:029 And all that handle H8610 (8802) the oar H4880, the mariners H4419, [and] all the pilots H2259 of the sea H3220, shall come down H3381 (8804) from their ships H0591, they shall stand H5975 (8799) upon the land H0776;
027:030 And shall cause their voice H6963 to be heard H8085 (8689) against thee, and shall cry H2199 (8799) bitterly H4751, and shall cast up H5927 (8686) dust H6083 upon their heads H7218, they shall wallow H6428 (8691) themselves in the ashes H0665:
027:031 And they shall make themselves utterly H7144 bald H7139 (8689) for thee, and gird H2296 (8804) them with sackcloth H8242, and they shall weep H1058 (8804) for thee with bitterness H4751 of heart H5315 [and] bitter H4751 wailing H4553.
027:032 And in their wailing H5204 they shall take up H5375 (8804) a lamentation H7015 for thee, and lament H6969 (8790) over thee, [saying], What [city is] like Tyrus H6865, like the destroyed H1822 in the midst H8432 of the sea H3220?
027:033 When thy wares H5801 went forth H3318 (8800) out of the seas H3220, thou filledst H7646 (8689) many H7227 people H5971; thou didst enrich H6238 (8689) the kings H4428 of the earth H0776 with the multitude H7230 of thy riches H1952 and of thy merchandise H4627.
027:034 In the time H6256 [when] thou shalt be broken H7665 (8737) by the seas H3220 in the depths H4615 of the waters H4325 thy merchandise H4627 and all thy company H6951 in the midst H8432 of thee shall fall H5307 (8804).
027:035 All the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the isles H0339 shall be astonished H8074 (8804) at thee, and their kings H4428 shall be sore H8178 afraid H8175 (8804), they shall be troubled H7481 (8804) in [their] countenance H6440.
027:036 The merchants H5503 (8802) among the people H5971 shall hiss H8319 (8804) at thee; thou shalt be a terror H1091, and never [shalt be] any more H5704 H5769.
028:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
028:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, say H0559 (8798) unto the prince H5057 of Tyrus H6865, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thine heart H3820 [is] lifted up H1361 (8804), and thou hast said H0559 (8799), I [am] a God H0410, I sit H3427 (8804) [in] the seat H4186 of God H0430, in the midst H3820 of the seas H3220; yet thou [art] a man H0120, and not God H0410, though thou set H5414 (8799) thine heart H3820 as the heart H3820 of God H0430:
028:003 Behold, thou [art] wiser H2450 than Daniel H1840; there is no secret H5640 (8803) that they can hide H6004 (8804) from thee:
028:004 With thy wisdom H2451 and with thine understanding H8394 thou hast gotten H6213 (8804) thee riches H2428, and hast gotten H6213 (8799) gold H2091 and silver H3701 into thy treasures H0214:
028:005 By thy great H7230 wisdom H2451 [and] by thy traffick H7404 hast thou increased H7235 (8689) thy riches H2428, and thine heart H3824 is lifted up H1361 (8799) because of thy riches H2428:
028:006 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thou hast set H5414 (8800) thine heart H3820 as the heart H3824 of God H0430;
028:007 Behold, therefore I will bring H0935 (8688) strangers H2114 (8801) upon thee, the terrible H6184 of the nations H1471: and they shall draw H7324 (8689) their swords H2719 against the beauty H3308 of thy wisdom H2451, and they shall defile H2490 (8765) thy brightness H3314.
028:008 They shall bring thee down H3381 (8686) to the pit H7845, and thou shalt die H4191 (8804) the deaths H4463 of [them that are] slain H2491 in the midst H3820 of the seas H3220.
028:009 Wilt thou yet H0559 (8800) say H0559 (8799) before H6440 him that slayeth H2026 (8802) thee, I [am] God H0430? but thou [shalt be] a man H0120, and no God H0410, in the hand H3027 of him that slayeth H2490 (8764) thee.
028:010 Thou shalt die H4191 (8799) the deaths H4194 of the uncircumcised H6189 by the hand H3027 of strangers H2114 (8801): for I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
028:011 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
028:012 Son H1121 of man H0120, take up H5375 (8798) a lamentation H7015 upon the king H4428 of Tyrus H6865, and say H0559 (8804) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Thou sealest up H2856 (8802) the sum H8508, full H4392 of wisdom H2451, and perfect H3632 in beauty H3308.
028:013 Thou hast been in Eden H5731 the garden H1588 of God H0430; every precious H3368 stone H0068 [was] thy covering H4540, the sardius H0124, topaz H6357, and the diamond H3095, the beryl H8658, the onyx H7718, and the jasper H3471, the sapphire H5601, the emerald H5306, and the carbuncle H1304, and gold H2091: the workmanship H4399 of thy tabrets H8596 and of thy pipes H5345 was prepared H3559 (8797) in thee in the day H3117 that thou wast created H1254 (8736).
028:014 Thou [art] the anointed H4473 cherub H3742 that covereth H5526 (8802); and I have set H5414 (8804) thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy H6944 mountain H2022 of God H0430; thou hast walked up and down H1980 (8694) in the midst H8432 of the stones H0068 of fire H0784.
028:015 Thou [wast] perfect H8549 in thy ways H1870 from the day H3117 that thou wast created H1254 (8736), till iniquity H5766 was found H4672 (8738) in thee.
028:016 By the multitude H7230 of thy merchandise H7404 they have filled H4390 (8804) the midst H8432 of thee with violence H2555, and thou hast sinned H2398 (8799): therefore I will cast thee as profane H2490 (8762) out of the mountain H2022 of God H0430: and I will destroy H0006 (8762) thee, O covering H5526 (8802) cherub H3742, from the midst H8432 of the stones H0068 of fire H0784.
028:017 Thine heart H3820 was lifted up H1361 (8804) because of thy beauty H3308, thou hast corrupted H7843 (8765) thy wisdom H2451 by reason of H5921 thy brightness H3314: I will cast H7993 (8689) thee to the ground H0776, I will lay H5414 (8804) thee before H6440 kings H4428, that they may behold H7200 (8800) thee.
028:018 Thou hast defiled H2490 (8765) thy sanctuaries H4720 by the multitude H7230 of thine iniquities H5771, by the iniquity H5766 of thy traffick H7404; therefore will I bring forth H3318 (8686) a fire H0784 from the midst H8432 of thee, it shall devour H0398 (8804) thee, and I will bring H5414 (8799) thee to ashes H0665 upon the earth H0776 in the sight H5869 of all them that behold H7200 (8802) thee.
028:019 All they that know H3045 (8802) thee among the people H5971 shall be astonished H8074 (8804) at thee: thou shalt be a terror H1091, and never H0369 [shalt] thou [be] any more H5704 H5769.
028:020 Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
028:021 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against Zidon H6721, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against it,
028:022 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Zidon H6721; and I will be glorified H3513 (8738) in the midst H8432 of thee: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I shall have executed H6213 (8800) judgments H8201 in her, and shall be sanctified H6942 (8738) in her.
028:023 For I will send H7971 (8765) into her pestilence H1698, and blood H1818 into her streets H2351; and the wounded H2491 shall be judged H5307 (8768) in the midst H8432 of her by the sword H2719 upon her on every side H5439; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
028:024 And there shall be no more a pricking H3992 (8688) brier H5544 unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, nor [any] grieving H3510 (8688) thorn H6975 of all [that are] round about H5439 them, that despised H7590 (8801) them; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
028:025 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; When I shall have gathered H6908 (8763) the house H1004 of Israel H3478 from the people H5971 among whom they are scattered H6327 (8738), and shall be sanctified H6942 (8738) in them in the sight H5869 of the heathen H1471, then shall they dwell H3427 (8804) in their land H0127 that I have given H5414 (8804) to my servant H5650 Jacob H3290.
028:026 And they shall dwell H3427 (8804) safely H0983 therein, and shall build H1129 (8804) houses H1004, and plant H5193 (8804) vineyards H3754; yea, they shall dwell H3427 (8804) with confidence H0983, when I have executed H6213 (8800) judgments H8201 upon all those that despise H7590 (8801) them round about H5439 them; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068 their God H0430.
029:001 ¶ In the tenth H6224 year H8141, in the tenth H6224 [month], in the twelfth H8147 H6240 [day] of the month H2320, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
029:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against him, and against all Egypt H4714:
029:003 Speak H1696 (8761), and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, the great H1419 dragon H8577 that lieth H7257 (8802) in the midst H8432 of his rivers H2975, which hath said H0559 (8804), My river H2975 [is] mine own, and I have made H6213 (8804) [it] for myself.
029:004 But I will put H5414 (8804) hooks H2397 (8676) H2397 in thy jaws H3895, and I will cause the fish H1710 of thy rivers H2975 to stick H1692 (8689) unto thy scales H7193, and I will bring thee up H5927 (8689) out of the midst H8432 of thy rivers H2975, and all the fish H1710 of thy rivers H2975 shall stick H1692 (8799) unto thy scales H7193.
029:005 And I will leave H5203 (8804) thee [thrown] into the wilderness H4057, thee and all the fish H1710 of thy rivers H2975: thou shalt fall H5307 (8799) upon the open H6440 fields H7704; thou shalt not be brought together H0622 (8735), nor gathered H6908 (8735): I have given H5414 (8804) thee for meat H0402 to the beasts H2416 of the field H0776 and to the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064.
029:006 And all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Egypt H4714 shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, because they have been a staff H4938 of reed H7070 to the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
029:007 When they took hold H8610 (8800) of thee by thy hand H3709, thou didst break H7533 (8735), and rend H1234 (8804) all their shoulder H3802: and when they leaned H8172 (8736) upon thee, thou brakest H7665 (8735), and madest all their loins H4975 to be at a stand H5976 (8689).
029:008 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) a sword H2719 upon thee, and cut off H3772 (8689) man H0120 and beast H0929 out of thee.
029:009 And the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 shall be desolate H8077 and waste H2723; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068: because he hath said H0559 (8804), The river H2975 [is] mine, and I have made H6213 (8804) [it].
029:010 Behold, therefore I [am] against thee, and against thy rivers H2975, and I will make H5414 (8804) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 utterly H2721 waste H2723 [and] desolate H8077, from the tower H4024 of Syene H5482 even unto the border H1366 of Ethiopia H3568.
029:011 No foot H7272 of man H0120 shall pass through H5674 (8799) it, nor foot H7272 of beast H0929 shall pass through H5674 (8799) it, neither shall it be inhabited H3427 (8799) forty H0705 years H8141.
029:012 And I will make H5414 (8804) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 desolate H8077 in the midst H8432 of the countries H0776 [that are] desolate H8074 (8737), and her cities H5892 among H8432 the cities H5892 [that are] laid waste H2717 (8716) shall be desolate H8077 forty H0705 years H8141: and I will scatter H6327 (8689) the Egyptians H4714 among the nations H1471, and will disperse H2219 (8765) them through the countries H0776.
029:013 Yet thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; At the end H7093 of forty H0705 years H8141 will I gather H6908 (8762) the Egyptians H4714 from the people H5971 whither they were scattered H6327 (8738):
029:014 And I will bring again H7725 (8804) the captivity H7622 of Egypt H4714, and will cause them to return H7725 (8689) [into] the land H0776 of Pathros H6624, into the land H0776 of their habitation H4351; and they shall be there a base H8217 kingdom H4467.
029:015 It shall be the basest H8217 of the kingdoms H4467; neither shall it exalt H5375 (8691) itself any more above the nations H1471: for I will diminish H4591 (8689) them, that they shall no more rule H7287 (8800) over the nations H1471.
029:016 And it shall be no more the confidence H4009 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, which bringeth H2142 [their] iniquity H5771 to remembrance H2142 (8688), when they shall look H6437 (8800) after H0310 them: but they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
029:017 And it came to pass in the seven H7651 and twentieth H6242 year H8141, in the first H7223 [month], in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
029:018 Son H1121 of man H0120, Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 caused H5647 his army H2428 to serve H5647 (8689) a great H1419 service H5656 against Tyrus H6865: every head H7218 [was] made bald H7139 (8716), and every shoulder H3802 [was] peeled H4803 (8803): yet had he no wages H7939, nor his army H2428, for Tyrus H6865, for the service H5656 that he had served H5647 (8804) against it:
029:019 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will give H5414 (8802) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 unto Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894; and he shall take H5375 (8804) her multitude H1995, and take H7997 (8804) her spoil H7998, and take H0962 (8804) her prey H0957; and it shall be the wages H7939 for his army H2428.
029:020 I have given H5414 (8804) him the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 [for] his labour H6468 wherewith he served H5647 (8804) against it, because they wrought H6213 (8804) for me, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
029:021 In that day H3117 will I cause H6779 the horn H7161 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 to bud forth H6779 (8686), and I will give H5414 (8799) thee the opening H6610 of the mouth H6310 in the midst H8432 of them; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
030:001 ¶ The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
030:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Howl H3213 (8685) ye, Woe worth H1929 the day H3117!
030:003 For the day H3117 [is] near H7138, even the day H3117 of the LORD H3068 [is] near H7138, a cloudy H6051 day H3117; it shall be the time H6256 of the heathen H1471.
030:004 And the sword H2719 shall come H0935 (8804) upon Egypt H4714, and great pain H2479 shall be in Ethiopia H3568, when the slain H2491 shall fall H5307 (8800) in Egypt H4714, and they shall take away H3947 (8804) her multitude H1995, and her foundations H3247 shall be broken down H2040 (8738).
030:005 Ethiopia H3568, and Libya H6316, and Lydia H3865, and all the mingled H6153 people, and Chub H3552, and the men H1121 of the land H0776 that is in league H1285, shall fall H5307 (8799) with them by the sword H2719.
030:006 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; They also that uphold H5564 (8802) Egypt H4714 shall fall H5307 (8804); and the pride H1347 of her power H5797 shall come down H3381 (8804): from the tower H4024 of Syene H5482 shall they fall H5307 (8799) in it by the sword H2719, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
030:007 And they shall be desolate H8074 (8738) in the midst H8432 of the countries H0776 [that are] desolate H8074 (8737), and her cities H5892 shall be in the midst H8432 of the cities H5892 [that are] wasted H2717 (8737).
030:008 And they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I have set H5414 (8800) a fire H0784 in Egypt H4714, and [when] all her helpers H5826 (8802) shall be destroyed H7665 (8738).
030:009 In that day H3117 shall messengers H4397 go forth H3318 (8799) from me H6440 in ships H6716 to make the careless H0983 Ethiopians H3568 afraid H2729 (8687), and great pain H2479 shall come upon them, as in the day H3117 of Egypt H4714: for, lo, it cometh H0935 (8802).
030:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will also make the multitude H1995 of Egypt H4714 to cease H7673 (8689) by the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
030:011 He and his people H5971 with him, the terrible H6184 of the nations H1471, shall be brought H0935 (8716) to destroy H7843 (8763) the land H0776: and they shall draw H7324 (8689) their swords H2719 against Egypt H4714, and fill H4390 (8804) the land H0776 with the slain H2491.
030:012 And I will make H5414 (8804) the rivers H2975 dry H2724, and sell H4376 (8804) the land H0776 into the hand H3027 of the wicked H7451: and I will make the land H0776 waste H8074 (8689), and all that is therein H4393, by the hand H3027 of strangers H2114 (8801): I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
030:013 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will also destroy H0006 (8689) the idols H1544, and I will cause [their] images H0457 to cease H7673 (8689) out of Noph H5297; and there shall be no more a prince H5387 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: and I will put H5414 (8804) a fear H3374 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
030:014 And I will make Pathros H6624 desolate H8074 (8689), and will set H5414 (8804) fire H0784 in Zoan H6814, and will execute H6213 (8804) judgments H8201 in No H4996.
030:015 And I will pour H8210 (8804) my fury H2534 upon Sin H5512, the strength H4581 of Egypt H4714; and I will cut off H3772 (8689) the multitude H1995 of No H4996.
030:016 And I will set H5414 (8804) fire H0784 in Egypt H4714: Sin H5512 shall have great H2342 (8800) pain H2342 (8799), and No H4996 shall be rent asunder H1234 (8736), and Noph H5297 [shall have] distresses H6862 daily H3119.
030:017 The young men H0970 of Aven H0206 and of Pibeseth H6364 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719: and these [cities] shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628.
030:018 At Tehaphnehes H8471 also the day H3117 shall be darkened H2821 (8804) (8676) H2820 (8804), when I shall break H7665 (8800) there the yokes H4133 of Egypt H4714: and the pomp H1347 of her strength H5797 shall cease H7673 (8738) in her H1931: as for her, a cloud H6051 shall cover H3680 (8762) her, and her daughters H1323 shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628.
030:019 Thus will I execute H6213 (8804) judgments H8201 in Egypt H4714: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
030:020 And it came to pass in the eleventh H0259 H6240 year H8141, in the first H7223 [month], in the seventh H7651 [day] of the month H2320, [that] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
030:021 Son H1121 of man H0120, I have broken H7665 (8804) the arm H2220 of Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714; and, lo, it shall not be bound up H2280 (8795) to be healed H7499 H5414 (8800), to put H7760 (8800) a roller H2848 to bind H2280 (8800) it, to make it strong H2388 (8800) to hold H8610 (8800) the sword H2719.
030:022 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and will break H7665 (8804) his arms H2220, the strong H2389, and that which was broken H7665 (8737); and I will cause the sword H2719 to fall H5307 (8689) out of his hand H3027.
030:023 And I will scatter H6327 (8689) the Egyptians H4714 among the nations H1471, and will disperse H2219 (8765) them through the countries H0776.
030:024 And I will strengthen H2388 (8765) the arms H2220 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and put H5414 (8804) my sword H2719 in his hand H3027: but I will break H7665 (8804) Pharaoh’s H6547 arms H2220, and he shall groan H5008 (8804) before H6440 him with the groanings H5009 of a deadly wounded H2491 [man].
030:025 But I will strengthen H2388 (8689) the arms H2220 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and the arms H2220 of Pharaoh H6547 shall fall down H5307 (8799); and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I shall put H5414 (8800) my sword H2719 into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall stretch it out H5186 (8804) upon the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
030:026 And I will scatter H6327 (8689) the Egyptians H4714 among the nations H1471, and disperse H2219 (8765) them among the countries H0776; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
031:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the eleventh H0259 H6240 year H8141, in the third H7992 [month], in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, [that] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
031:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, speak H0559 (8798) unto Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and to his multitude H1995; Whom art thou like H1819 (8804) in thy greatness H1433?
031:003 Behold, the Assyrian H0804 [was] a cedar H0730 in Lebanon H3844 with fair H3303 branches H6057, and with a shadowing H6751 (8688) shroud H2793, and of an high H1362 stature H6967; and his top H6788 was among the thick boughs H5688.
031:004 The waters H4325 made him great H1431 (8765), the deep H8415 set him up on high H7311 (8790) with her rivers H5104 running H1980 (8802) round about H5439 his plants H4302, and sent out H7971 (8765) her little rivers H8585 unto all the trees H6086 of the field H7704.
031:005 Therefore his height H6967 was exalted H1361 (8804) above all the trees H6086 of the field H7704, and his boughs H5634 were multiplied H7235 (8799), and his branches H6288 became long H0748 (8799) because of the multitude H7227 of waters H4325, when he shot forth H7971 (8763).
031:006 All the fowls H5775 of heaven H8064 made their nests H7077 (8765) in his boughs H5589, and under his branches H6288 did all the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 bring forth their young H3205 (8804), and under his shadow H6738 dwelt H3427 (8799) all great H7227 nations H1471.
031:007 Thus was he fair H3302 (8799) in his greatness H1433, in the length H0753 of his branches H1808: for his root H8328 was by great H7227 waters H4325.
031:008 The cedars H0730 in the garden H1588 of God H0430 could not hide H6004 (8804) him: the fir trees H1265 were not like H1819 (8804) his boughs H5589, and the chesnut trees H6196 were not like his branches H6288; nor any tree H6086 in the garden H1588 of God H0430 was like H1819 (8804) unto him in his beauty H3308.
031:009 I have made H6213 (8804) him fair H3303 by the multitude H7230 of his branches H1808: so that all the trees H6086 of Eden H5731, that [were] in the garden H1588 of God H0430, envied H7065 (8762) him.
031:010 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because thou hast lifted up H1361 (8804) thyself in height H6967, and he hath shot up H5414 (8799) his top H6788 among the thick boughs H5688, and his heart H3824 is lifted up H7311 (8804) in his height H1363;
031:011 I have therefore delivered H5414 (8799) him into the hand H3027 of the mighty one H0410 of the heathen H1471; he shall surely H6213 (8800) deal H6213 (8799) with him: I have driven him out H1644 (8765) for his wickedness H7562.
031:012 And strangers H2114 (8801), the terrible H6184 of the nations H1471, have cut him off H3772 (8799), and have left H5203 (8799) him: upon the mountains H2022 and in all the valleys H1516 his branches H1808 are fallen H5307 (8804), and his boughs H6288 are broken H7665 (8735) by all the rivers H0650 of the land H0776; and all the people H5971 of the earth H0776 are gone down H3381 (8799) from his shadow H6738, and have left H5203 (8799) him.
031:013 Upon his ruin H4658 shall all the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064 remain H7931 (8799), and all the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 shall be upon his branches H6288:
031:014 To the end that none of all the trees H6086 by the waters H4325 exalt H1361 (8799) themselves for their height H6967, neither shoot up H5414 (8799) their top H6788 among the thick boughs H5688, neither their trees H0352 stand up H5975 (8799) in their height H1363, all that drink H8354 (8802) water H4325: for they are all delivered H5414 (8738) unto death H4194, to the nether parts H8482 of the earth H0776, in the midst H8432 of the children H1121 of men H0120, with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953.
031:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; In the day H3117 when he went down H3381 (8800) to the grave H7585 I caused a mourning H0056 (8689): I covered H3680 (8765) the deep H8415 for him, and I restrained H4513 (8799) the floods H5104 thereof, and the great H7227 waters H4325 were stayed H3607 (8735): and I caused Lebanon H3844 to mourn H6937 (8686) for him, and all the trees H6086 of the field H7704 fainted H5969 for him.
031:016 I made the nations H1471 to shake H7493 (8689) at the sound H6963 of his fall H4658, when I cast him down H3381 (8687) to hell H7585 with them that descend H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953: and all the trees H6086 of Eden H5731, the choice H4005 and best H2896 of Lebanon H3844, all that drink H8354 (8802) water H4325, shall be comforted H5162 (8735) in the nether parts H8482 of the earth H0776.
031:017 They also went down H3381 (8804) into hell H7585 with him unto [them that be] slain H2491 with the sword H2719; and [they that were] his arm H2220, [that] dwelt H3427 (8804) under his shadow H6738 in the midst H8432 of the heathen H1471.
031:018 To whom art thou thus like H1819 (8804) in glory H3519 and in greatness H1433 among the trees H6086 of Eden H5731? yet shalt thou be brought down H3381 (8717) with the trees H6086 of Eden H5731 unto the nether parts H8482 of the earth H0776: thou shalt lie H7901 (8799) in the midst H8432 of the uncircumcised H6189 with [them that be] slain H2491 by the sword H2719. This [is] Pharaoh H6547 and all his multitude H1995, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
032:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the twelfth H8147 H6240 year H8141, in the twelfth month H2320, in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, [that] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
032:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, take up H5375 (8798) a lamentation H7015 for Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and say H0559 (8804) unto him, Thou art like H1819 (8738) a young lion H3715 of the nations H1471, and thou [art] as a whale H8577 (8676) H8565 in the seas H3220: and thou camest forth H1518 (8799) with thy rivers H5104, and troubledst H1804 (8799) the waters H4325 with thy feet H7272, and fouledst H7515 (8799) their rivers H5104.
032:003 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will therefore spread out H6566 (8804) my net H7568 over thee with a company H6951 of many H7227 people H5971; and they shall bring thee up H5927 (8689) in my net H2764.
032:004 Then will I leave H5203 (8804) thee upon the land H0776, I will cast thee forth H2904 (8686) upon the open H6440 field H7704, and will cause all the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064 to remain H7931 (8689) upon thee, and I will fill H7646 (8689) the beasts H2416 of the whole earth H0776 with thee.
032:005 And I will lay H5414 (8804) thy flesh H1320 upon the mountains H2022, and fill H4390 (8765) the valleys H1516 with thy height H7419.
032:006 I will also water H8248 (8689) with thy blood H1818 the land H0776 wherein thou swimmest H6824, [even] to the mountains H2022; and the rivers H0650 shall be full H4390 (8735) of thee.
032:007 And when I shall put thee out H3518 (8763), I will cover H3680 (8765) the heaven H8064, and make H6937 the stars H3556 thereof dark H6937 (8689); I will cover H3680 (8762) the sun H8121 with a cloud H6051, and the moon H3394 shall not give H0215 (8686) her light H0216.
032:008 All the bright H3974 lights H0216 of heaven H8064 will I make dark H6937 (8686) over thee, and set H5414 (8804) darkness H2822 upon thy land H0776, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
032:009 I will also vex H3707 (8689) the hearts H3820 of many H7227 people H5971, when I shall bring H0935 (8687) thy destruction H7667 among the nations H1471, into the countries H0776 which thou hast not known H3045 (8804).
032:010 Yea, I will make many H7227 people H5971 amazed H8074 (8689) at thee, and their kings H4428 shall be horribly H8178 afraid H8175 (8799) for thee, when I shall brandish H5774 (8788) my sword H2719 before them H6440; and they shall tremble H2729 (8804) at [every] moment H7281, every man H0376 for his own life H5315, in the day H3117 of thy fall H4658.
032:011 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; The sword H2719 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 shall come H0935 (8799) upon thee.
032:012 By the swords H2719 of the mighty H1368 will I cause thy multitude H1995 to fall H5307 (8686), the terrible H6184 of the nations H1471, all of them: and they shall spoil H7703 (8804) the pomp H1347 of Egypt H4714, and all the multitude H1995 thereof shall be destroyed H8045 (8738).
032:013 I will destroy H0006 (8689) also all the beasts H0929 thereof from H5921 beside the great H7227 waters H4325; neither shall the foot H7272 of man H0120 trouble H1804 (8799) them any more, nor the hoofs H6541 of beasts H0929 trouble H1804 (8799) them.
032:014 Then will I make their waters H4325 deep H8257 (8686), and cause their rivers H5104 to run H3212 (8686) like oil H8081, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
032:015 When I shall make H5414 (8800) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 desolate H8077, and the country H0776 shall be destitute H8074 (8737) of that whereof it was full H4393, when I shall smite H5221 (8687) all them that dwell H3427 (8802) therein, then shall they know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
032:016 This [is] the lamentation H7015 wherewith they shall lament H6969 (8790) her: the daughters H1323 of the nations H1471 shall lament H6969 (8787) her: they shall lament H6969 (8787) for her, [even] for Egypt H4714, and for all her multitude H1995, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
032:017 It came to pass also in the twelfth H8147 H6240 year H8141, in the fifteenth H2568 H6240 [day] of the month H2320, [that] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
032:018 Son H1121 of man H0120, wail H5091 (8798) for the multitude H1995 of Egypt H4714, and cast them down H3381 (8685), [even] her, and the daughters H1323 of the famous H0117 nations H1471, unto the nether parts H8482 of the earth H0776, with them that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953.
032:019 Whom dost thou pass in beauty H5276 (8804)? go down H3381 (8798), and be thou laid H7901 (8713) with the uncircumcised H6189.
032:020 They shall fall H5307 (8799) in the midst H8432 of [them that are] slain H2491 by the sword H2719: she is delivered H5414 (8738) to the sword H2719: draw H4900 (8798) her and all her multitudes H1995.
032:021 The strong H0410 among the mighty H1368 shall speak H1696 (8762) to him out of the midst H8432 of hell H7585 with them that help H5826 (8802) him: they are gone down H3381 (8804), they lie H7901 (8804) uncircumcised H6189, slain H2491 by the sword H2719.
032:022 Asshur H0804 [is] there and all her company H6951: his graves H6913 [are] about H5439 him: all of them slain H2491, fallen H5307 (8802) by the sword H2719:
032:023 Whose graves H6913 are set H5414 (8738) in the sides H3411 of the pit H0953, and her company H6951 is round about H5439 her grave H6900: all of them slain H2491, fallen H5307 (8802) by the sword H2719, which caused H5414 (8804) terror H2851 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
032:024 There [is] Elam H5867 and all her multitude H1995 round about H5439 her grave H6900, all of them slain H2491, fallen H5307 (8802) by the sword H2719, which are gone down H3381 (8804) uncircumcised H6189 into the nether parts H8482 of the earth H0776, which caused H5414 (8804) their terror H2851 in the land H0776 of the living H2416; yet have they borne H5375 (8799) their shame H3639 with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953.
032:025 They have set H5414 (8804) her a bed H4904 in the midst H8432 of the slain H2491 with all her multitude H1995: her graves H6913 [are] round about H5439 him: all of them uncircumcised H6189, slain H2491 by the sword H2719: though their terror H2851 was caused H5414 (8737) in the land H0776 of the living H2416, yet have they borne H5375 (8799) their shame H3639 with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953: he is put H5414 (8738) in the midst H8432 of [them that be] slain H2491.
032:026 There [is] Meshech H4902, Tubal H8422, and all her multitude H1995: her graves H6913 [are] round about H5439 him: all of them uncircumcised H6189, slain H2490 (8794) by the sword H2719, though they caused H5414 (8804) their terror H2851 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
032:027 And they shall not lie H7901 (8799) with the mighty H1368 [that are] fallen H5307 (8802) of the uncircumcised H6189, which are gone down H3381 (8804) to hell H7585 with their weapons H3627 of war H4421: and they have laid H5414 (8799) their swords H2719 under their heads H7218, but their iniquities H5771 shall be upon their bones H6106, though [they were] the terror H2851 of the mighty H1368 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
032:028 Yea, thou shalt be broken H7665 (8735) in the midst H8432 of the uncircumcised H6189, and shalt lie H7901 (8799) with [them that are] slain H2491 with the sword H2719.
032:029 There [is] Edom H0123, her kings H4428, and all her princes H5387, which with their might H1369 are laid H5414 (8738) by [them that were] slain H2491 by the sword H2719: they shall lie H7901 (8799) with the uncircumcised H6189, and with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953.
032:030 There [be] the princes H5257 of the north H6828, all of them, and all the Zidonians H6722, which are gone down H3381 (8804) with the slain H2491; with their terror H2851 they are ashamed H0954 (8802) of their might H1369; and they lie H7901 (8799) uncircumcised H6189 with [them that be] slain H2491 by the sword H2719, and bear H5375 (8799) their shame H3639 with them that go down H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953.
032:031 Pharaoh H6547 shall see H7200 (8799) them, and shall be comforted H5162 (8738) over all his multitude H1995, [even] Pharaoh H6547 and all his army H2428 slain H2491 by the sword H2719, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
032:032 For I have caused H5414 (8804) my terror H2851 in the land H0776 of the living H2416: and he shall be laid H7901 (8717) in the midst H8432 of the uncircumcised H6189 with [them that are] slain H2491 with the sword H2719, [even] Pharaoh H6547 and all his multitude H1995, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
033:001 ¶ Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
033:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, speak H1696 (8761) to the children H1121 of thy people H5971, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When I bring H0935 (8686) the sword H2719 upon a land H0776, if the people H5971 of the land H0776 take H3947 (8804) a H0259 man H0376 of their coasts H7097, and set H5414 (8804) him for their watchman H6822 (8802):
033:003 If when he seeth H7200 (8804) the sword H2719 come H0935 (8802) upon the land H0776, he blow H8628 (8804) the trumpet H7782, and warn H2094 (8689) the people H5971;
033:004 Then whosoever H8085 (8802) heareth H8085 (8804) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, and taketh not warning H2094 (8737); if the sword H2719 come H0935 (8799), and take him away H3947 (8799), his blood H1818 shall be upon his own head H7218.
033:005 He heard H8085 (8804) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, and took not warning H2094 (8737); his blood H1818 shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning H2094 (8737) shall deliver H4422 (8765) his soul H5315.
033:006 But if the watchman H6822 (8802) see H7200 (8799) the sword H2719 come H0935 (8802), and blow H8628 (8804) not the trumpet H7782, and the people H5971 be not warned H2094 (8737); if the sword H2719 come H0935 (8799), and take H3947 (8799) [any] person H5315 from among them, he is taken away H3947 (8738) in his iniquity H5771; but his blood H1818 will I require H1875 (8799) at the watchman’s H6822 (8802) hand H3027.
033:007 So thou, O son H1121 of man H0120, I have set H5414 (8804) thee a watchman H6822 (8802) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478; therefore thou shalt hear H8085 (8804) the word H1697 at my mouth H6310, and warn H2094 (8689) them from me.
033:008 When I say H0559 (8800) unto the wicked H7563, O wicked H7563 [man], thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799); if thou dost not speak H1696 (8765) to warn H2094 (8687) the wicked H7563 from his way H1870, that wicked H7563 [man] shall die H4191 (8799) in his iniquity H5771; but his blood H1818 will I require H1245 (8762) at thine hand H3027.
033:009 Nevertheless, if thou warn H2094 (8689) the wicked H7563 of his way H1870 to turn H7725 (8800) from it; if he do not turn H7725 (8804) from his way H1870, he shall die H4191 (8799) in his iniquity H5771; but thou hast delivered H5337 (8689) thy soul H5315.
033:010 Therefore, O thou son H1121 of man H0120, speak H0559 (8798) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478; Thus ye speak H0559 (8804), saying H0559 (8800), If our transgressions H6588 and our sins H2403 [be] upon us, and we pine away H4743 (8737) in them, how should we then live H2421 (8799)?
033:011 Say H0559 (8798) unto them, [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, I have no pleasure H2654 (8799) in the death H4194 of the wicked H7563; but that the wicked H7563 turn H7725 (8800) from his way H1870 and live H2421 (8804): turn H7725 (8798) ye, turn H7725 (8798) ye from your evil H7451 ways H1870; for why will ye die H4191 (8799), O house H1004 of Israel H3478?
033:012 Therefore, thou son H1121 of man H0120, say H0559 (8798) unto the children H1121 of thy people H5971, The righteousness H6666 of the righteous H6662 shall not deliver H5337 (8686) him in the day H3117 of his transgression H6588: as for the wickedness H7564 of the wicked H7563, he shall not fall H3782 (8735) thereby in the day H3117 that he turneth H7725 (8800) from his wickedness H7562; neither shall the righteous H6662 be able H3201 (8799) to live H2421 (8800) for his [righteousness] in the day H3117 that he sinneth H2398 (8800).
033:013 When I shall say H0559 (8800) to the righteous H6662, [that] he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799); if he trust H0982 (8804) to his own righteousness H6666, and commit H6213 (8804) iniquity H5766, all his righteousnesses H6666 shall not be remembered H2142 (8735); but for his iniquity H5766 that he hath committed H6213 (8804), he shall die H4191 (8799) for it.
033:014 Again, when I say H0559 (8800) unto the wicked H7563, Thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799); if he turn H7725 (8804) from his sin H2403, and do H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666;
033:015 [If] the wicked H7563 restore H7725 (8686) the pledge H2258, give again H7999 (8762) that he had robbed H1500, walk H1980 (8804) in the statutes H2708 of life H2416, without committing H6213 (8800) iniquity H5766; he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799), he shall not die H4191 (8799).
033:016 None of his sins H2403 that he hath committed H2398 (8804) shall be mentioned H2142 (8735) unto him: he hath done H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666; he shall surely H2421 (8800) live H2421 (8799).
033:017 Yet the children H1121 of thy people H5971 say H0559 (8804), The way H1870 of the Lord H0136 is not equal H8505 (8735): but as for them, their way H1870 is not equal H8505 (8735).
033:018 When the righteous H6662 turneth H7725 (8800) from his righteousness H6666, and committeth H6213 (8804) iniquity H5766, he shall even die H4191 (8804) thereby.
033:019 But if the wicked H7563 turn H7725 (8800) from his wickedness H7564, and do H6213 (8804) that which is lawful H4941 and right H6666, he shall live H2421 (8799) thereby.
033:020 Yet ye say H0559 (8804), The way H1870 of the Lord H0136 is not equal H8505 (8735). O ye house H1004 of Israel H3478, I will judge H8199 (8799) you every one H0376 after his ways H1870.
033:021 And it came to pass in the twelfth H8147 H6240 year H8141 of our captivity H1546, in the tenth H6224 [month], in the fifth H2568 [day] of the month H2320, [that] one that had escaped H6412 out of Jerusalem H3389 came H0935 (8804) unto me, saying H0559 (8800), The city H5892 is smitten H5221 (8717).
033:022 Now the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was upon me in the evening H6153, afore H6440 he that was escaped H6412 came H0935 (8800); and had opened H6605 (8799) my mouth H6310, until he came H0935 (8800) to me in the morning H1242; and my mouth H6310 was opened H6605 (8735), and I was no more dumb H0481 (8738).
033:023 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
033:024 Son H1121 of man H0120, they that inhabit H3427 (8802) those wastes H2723 of the land H0127 of Israel H3478 speak H0559 (8802), saying H0559 (8800), Abraham H0085 was one H0259, and he inherited H3423 (8799) the land H0776: but we [are] many H7227; the land H0776 is given H5414 (8738) us for inheritance H4181.
033:025 Wherefore say H0559 (8798) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Ye eat H0398 (8799) with the blood H1818, and lift up H5375 (8799) your eyes H5869 toward your idols H1544, and shed H8210 (8799) blood H1818: and shall ye possess H3423 (8799) the land H0776?
033:026 Ye stand H5975 (8804) upon your sword H2719, ye work H6213 (8804) abomination H8441, and ye defile H2930 (8765) every one H0376 his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802: and shall ye possess H3423 (8799) the land H0776?
033:027 Say H0559 (8799) thou thus unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; [As] I live H2416, surely they that [are] in the wastes H2723 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719, and him that [is] in the open H6440 field H7704 will I give H5414 (8804) to the beasts H2416 to be devoured H0398 (8800), and they that [be] in the forts H4679 and in the caves H4631 shall die H4191 (8799) of the pestilence H1698.
033:028 For I will lay H5414 (8804) the land H0776 most H4923 desolate H8077, and the pomp H1347 of her strength H5797 shall cease H7673 (8738); and the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478 shall be desolate H8074 (8804), that none shall pass through H5674 (8802).
033:029 Then shall they know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I have laid H5414 (8800) the land H0776 most H4923 desolate H8077 because of all their abominations H8441 which they have committed H6213 (8804).
033:030 Also, thou son H1121 of man H0120, the children H1121 of thy people H5971 still are talking H1696 (8737) against H0681 thee by the walls H7023 and in the doors H6607 of the houses H1004, and speak H1696 (8765) one H2297 to another H0259, every one H0376 to his brother H0251, saying H0559 (8800), Come H0935 (8798), I pray you, and hear H8085 (8798) what is the word H1697 that cometh forth H3318 (8802) from the LORD H3068.
033:031 And they come H0935 (8799) unto thee as the people H5971 cometh H3996, and they sit H3427 (8799) before H6440 thee [as] my people H5971, and they hear H8085 (8804) thy words H1697, but they will not do H6213 (8799) them: for with their mouth H6310 they shew H6213 (8802) much love H5690, [but] their heart H3820 goeth H1980 (8802) after H0310 their covetousness H1215.
033:032 And, lo, thou [art] unto them as a very lovely H5690 song H7892 of one that hath a pleasant H3303 voice H6963, and can play well H2895 (8688) on an instrument H5059 (8763): for they hear H8085 (8804) thy words H1697, but they do H6213 (8802) them not.
033:033 And when this cometh to pass H0935 (8800), (lo, it will come H0935 (8802),) then shall they know H3045 (8804) that a prophet H5030 hath been among H8432 them.
034:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
034:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) against the shepherds H7462 (8802) of Israel H3478, prophesy H5012 (8734), and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 unto the shepherds H7462 (8802); Woe H1945 [be] to the shepherds H7462 (8802) of Israel H3478 that do feed H7462 (8802) themselves! should not the shepherds H7462 (8802) feed H7462 (8799) the flocks H6629?
034:003 Ye eat H0398 (8799) the fat H2459, and ye clothe H3847 (8799) you with the wool H6785, ye kill H2076 (8799) them that are fed H1277: [but] ye feed H7462 (8799) not the flock H6629.
034:004 The diseased H2470 (8737) have ye not strengthened H2388 (8765), neither have ye healed H7495 (8765) that which was sick H2470 (8802), neither have ye bound up H2280 (8804) [that which was] broken H7665 (8737), neither have ye brought again H7725 (8689) that which was driven away H5080 (8737), neither have ye sought H1245 (8765) that which was lost H0006 (8802); but with force H2394 and with cruelty H6531 have ye ruled H7287 (8804) them.
034:005 And they were scattered H6327 (8799), because [there is] no shepherd H7462 (8802): and they became meat H0402 to all the beasts H2416 of the field H7704, when they were scattered H6327 (8799).
034:006 My sheep H6629 wandered H7686 (8799) through all the mountains H2022, and upon every high H7311 (8802) hill H1389: yea, my flock H6629 was scattered H6327 (8738) upon all the face H6440 of the earth H0776, and none did search H1875 (8802) or seek H1245 (8764) [after them].
034:007 Therefore, ye shepherds H7462 (8802), hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068;
034:008 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, surely because my flock H6629 became a prey H0957, and my flock H6629 became meat H0402 to every beast H2416 of the field H7704, because [there was] no shepherd H7462 (8802), neither did my shepherds H7462 (8802) search H1875 (8804) for my flock H6629, but the shepherds H7462 (8802) fed H7462 (8799) themselves, and fed H7462 (8804) not my flock H6629;
034:009 Therefore, O ye shepherds H7462 (8802), hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068;
034:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against the shepherds H7462 (8802); and I will require H1875 (8804) my flock H6629 at their hand H3027, and cause them to cease H7673 (8689) from feeding H7462 (8800) the flock H6629; neither shall the shepherds H7462 (8802) feed H7462 (8799) themselves any more; for I will deliver H5337 (8689) my flock H6629 from their mouth H6310, that they may not be meat H0402 for them.
034:011 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I, [even] I, will both search H1875 (8804) my sheep H6629, and seek them out H1239 (8765).
034:012 As a shepherd H7462 (8802) seeketh out H1243 his flock H5739 in the day H3117 that he is among H8432 his sheep H6629 [that are] scattered H6567 (8737); so will I seek out H1239 (8762) my sheep H6629, and will deliver H5337 (8689) them out of all places H4725 where they have been scattered H6327 (8738) in the cloudy H6051 and dark H6205 day H3117.
034:013 And I will bring them out H3318 (8689) from the people H5971, and gather H6908 (8765) them from the countries H0776, and will bring H0935 (8689) them to their own land H0127, and feed H7462 (8804) them upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478 by the rivers H0650, and in all the inhabited places H4186 of the country H0776.
034:014 I will feed H7462 (8799) them in a good H2896 pasture H4829, and upon the high H4791 mountains H2022 of Israel H3478 shall their fold H5116 be: there shall they lie H7257 (8799) in a good H2896 fold H5116, and [in] a fat H8082 pasture H4829 shall they feed H7462 (8799) upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478.
034:015 I will feed H7462 (8799) my flock H6629, and I will cause them to lie down H7257 (8686), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
034:016 I will seek H1245 (8762) that which was lost H0006 (8802), and bring again H7725 (8686) that which was driven away H5080 (8737), and will bind up H2280 (8799) [that which was] broken H7665 (8737), and will strengthen H2388 (8762) that which was sick H2470 (8802): but I will destroy H8045 (8686) the fat H8082 and the strong H2389; I will feed H7462 (8799) them with judgment H4941.
034:017 And [as for] you H0859, O my flock H6629, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I judge H8199 (8802) between cattle H7716 and cattle H7716, between the rams H0352 and the he goats H6260.
034:018 [Seemeth it] a small thing H4592 unto you to have eaten up H7462 (8799) the good H2896 pasture H4829, but ye must tread down H7429 (8799) with your feet H7272 the residue H3499 of your pastures H4829? and to have drunk H8354 (8799) of the deep H4950 waters H4325, but ye must foul H7515 (8799) the residue H3498 (8737) with your feet H7272?
034:019 And [as for] my flock H6629, they eat H7462 (8799) that which ye have trodden H4823 with your feet H7272; and they drink H8354 (8799) that which ye have fouled H4833 with your feet H7272.
034:020 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 unto them; Behold, I, [even] I, will judge H8199 (8804) between the fat H1274 cattle H7716 and between the lean H7330 cattle H7716.
034:021 Because ye have thrust H1920 (8799) with side H6654 and with shoulder H3802, and pushed H5055 (8762) all the diseased H2470 (8737) with your horns H7161, till ye have scattered H6327 (8689) them abroad H2351;
034:022 Therefore will I save H3467 (8689) my flock H6629, and they shall no more be a prey H0957; and I will judge H8199 (8804) between cattle H7716 and cattle H7716.
034:023 And I will set up H6965 (8689) one H0259 shepherd H7462 (8802) over them, and he shall feed H7462 (8804) them, [even] my servant H5650 David H1732; he shall feed H7462 (8799) them, and he shall be their shepherd H7462 (8802).
034:024 And I the LORD H3068 will be their God H0430, and my servant H5650 David H1732 a prince H5387 among H8432 them; I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
034:025 And I will make H3772 (8804) with them a covenant H1285 of peace H7965, and will cause the evil H7451 beasts H2416 to cease H7673 (8689) out of the land H0776: and they shall dwell H3427 (8804) safely H0983 in the wilderness H4057, and sleep H3462 (8804) in the woods H3293 (8675) H3264.
034:026 And I will make H5414 (8804) them and the places round about H5439 my hill H1389 a blessing H1293; and I will cause the shower H1653 to come down H3381 (8689) in his season H6256; there shall be showers H1653 of blessing H1293.
034:027 And the tree H6086 of the field H7704 shall yield H5414 (8804) her fruit H6529, and the earth H0776 shall yield H5414 (8799) her increase H2981, and they shall be safe H0983 in their land H0127, and shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I have broken H7665 (8800) the bands H4133 of their yoke H5923, and delivered H5337 (8689) them out of the hand H3027 of those that served H5647 (8802) themselves of them.
034:028 And they shall no more be a prey H0957 to the heathen H1471, neither shall the beast H2416 of the land H0776 devour H0398 (8799) them; but they shall dwell H3427 (8804) safely H0983, and none shall make [them] afraid H2729 (8688).
034:029 And I will raise up H6965 (8689) for them a plant H4302 of renown H8034, and they shall be no more consumed H0622 (8803) with hunger H7458 in the land H0776, neither bear H5375 (8799) the shame H3639 of the heathen H1471 any more.
034:030 Thus shall they know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 their God H0430 [am] with them, and [that] they, [even] the house H1004 of Israel H3478, [are] my people H5971, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
034:031 And ye H0859 my flock H6629, the flock H6629 of my pasture H4830, [are] men H0120, [and] I [am] your God H0430, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
035:001 ¶ Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
035:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against mount H2022 Seir H8165, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against it,
035:003 And say H0559 (8804) unto it, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, O mount H2022 Seir H8165, I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out H5186 (8804) mine hand H3027 against thee, and I will make H5414 (8804) thee most H4923 desolate H8077.
035:004 I will lay H7760 (8799) thy cities H5892 waste H2723, and thou shalt be desolate H8077, and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
035:005 Because thou hast had a perpetual H5769 hatred H0342, and hast shed H5064 (8686) [the blood of] the children H1121 of Israel H3478 by the force H3027 of the sword H2719 in the time H6256 of their calamity H0343, in the time H6256 [that their] iniquity H5771 [had] an end H7093:
035:006 Therefore, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, I will prepare H6213 (8799) thee unto blood H1818, and blood H1818 shall pursue H7291 (8799) thee: sith H0518 thou hast not hated H8130 (8804) blood H1818, even blood H1818 shall pursue H7291 (8799) thee.
035:007 Thus will I make H5414 (8804) mount H2022 Seir H8165 most H8077 desolate H8077, and cut off H3772 (8689) from it him that passeth out H5674 (8802) and him that returneth H7725 (8802).
035:008 And I will fill H4390 (8765) his mountains H2022 with his slain H2491 [men]: in thy hills H1389, and in thy valleys H1516, and in all thy rivers H0650, shall they fall H5307 (8799) that are slain H2491 with the sword H2719.
035:009 I will make H5414 (8799) thee perpetual H5769 desolations H8077, and thy cities H5892 shall not return H7725 (8799) (8675) H3427 (8799): and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
035:010 Because thou hast said H0559 (8800), These two H8147 nations H1471 and these two H8147 countries H0776 shall be mine, and we will possess H3423 (8804) it; whereas the LORD H3068 was there:
035:011 Therefore, [as] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, I will even do H6213 (8804) according to thine anger H0639, and according to thine envy H7068 which thou hast used H6213 (8804) out of thy hatred H8135 against them; and I will make myself known H3045 (8738) among them, when I have judged H8199 (8799) thee.
035:012 And thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, [and that] I have heard H8085 (8804) all thy blasphemies H5007 which thou hast spoken H0559 (8804) against the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), They are laid desolate H8074 (8804) (8675) H8077, they are given H5414 (8738) us to consume H0402.
035:013 Thus with your mouth H6310 ye have boasted H1431 (8686) against me, and have multiplied H6280 (8689) your words H1697 against me: I have heard H8085 (8804) [them].
035:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; When the whole earth H0776 rejoiceth H8055 (8800), I will make H6213 (8799) thee desolate H8077.
035:015 As thou didst rejoice H8057 at the inheritance H5159 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, because it was desolate H8074 (8804), so will I do H6213 (8799) unto thee: thou shalt be desolate H8077, O mount H2022 Seir H8165, and all Idumea H0123, [even] all of it: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
036:001 ¶ Also, thou son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) unto the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804), Ye mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068:
036:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because the enemy H0341 (8802) hath said H0559 (8804) against you, Aha H1889, even the ancient H5769 high places H1116 are ours in possession H4181:
036:003 Therefore prophesy H5012 (8734) and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because they have made [you] desolate H8074 (8800), and swallowed you up H7602 (8800) on every side H5439, that ye might be a possession H4181 unto the residue H7611 of the heathen H1471, and ye are taken up H5927 (8735) in the lips H8193 of talkers H3956, and [are] an infamy H1681 of the people H5971:
036:004 Therefore, ye mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 to the mountains H2022, and to the hills H1389, to the rivers H0650, and to the valleys H1516, to the desolate H8074 (8802) wastes H2723, and to the cities H5892 that are forsaken H5800 (8737), which became a prey H0957 and derision H3933 to the residue H7611 of the heathen H1471 that [are] round about H5439;
036:005 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Surely in the fire H0784 of my jealousy H7068 have I spoken H1696 (8765) against the residue H7611 of the heathen H1471, and against all Idumea H0123, which have appointed H5414 (8804) my land H0776 into their possession H4181 with the joy H8057 of all [their] heart H3824, with despiteful H7589 minds H5315, to cast it out H4054 for a prey H0957.
036:006 Prophesy H5012 (8734) therefore concerning the land H0127 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto the mountains H2022, and to the hills H1389, to the rivers H0650, and to the valleys H1516, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I have spoken H1696 (8765) in my jealousy H7068 and in my fury H2534, because ye have borne H5375 (8804) the shame H3639 of the heathen H1471:
036:007 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I have lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027, Surely the heathen H1471 that [are] about H5439 you, they shall bear H5375 (8799) their shame H3639.
036:008 But ye, O mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, ye shall shoot forth H5414 (8799) your branches H6057, and yield H5375 (8799) your fruit H6529 to my people H5971 of Israel H3478; for they are at hand H7126 (8765) to come H0935 (8800).
036:009 For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn H6437 (8804) unto you, and ye shall be tilled H5647 (8738) and sown H2232 (8738):
036:010 And I will multiply H7235 (8689) men H0120 upon you, all the house H1004 of Israel H3478, [even] all of it: and the cities H5892 shall be inhabited H3427 (8738), and the wastes H2723 shall be builded H1129 (8735):
036:011 And I will multiply H7235 (8689) upon you man H0120 and beast H0929; and they shall increase H7235 (8804) and bring fruit H6509 (8804): and I will settle H3427 (8689) you after your old estates H6927, and will do better H2895 (8689) [unto you] than at your beginnings H7221: and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
036:012 Yea, I will cause men H0120 to walk H3212 (8689) upon you, [even] my people H5971 Israel H3478; and they shall possess H3423 (8804) thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance H5159, and thou shalt no more H3254 (8686) henceforth bereave H7921 (8763) them [of men].
036:013 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Because they say H0559 (8802) unto you, Thou [land] devourest up H0398 (8802) men H0120, and hast bereaved H7921 (8764) thy nations H1471;
036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour H0398 (8799) men H0120 no more, neither bereave H7921 (8762) H3782 (8762) thy nations H1471 any more, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
036:015 Neither will I cause [men] to hear H8085 (8686) in thee the shame H3639 of the heathen H1471 any more, neither shalt thou bear H5375 (8799) the reproach H2781 of the people H5971 any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations H1471 to fall H3782 (8686) any more, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
036:016 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
036:017 Son H1121 of man H0120, when the house H1004 of Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8802) in their own land H0127, they defiled H2930 (8762) it by their own way H1870 and by their doings H5949: their way H1870 was before H6440 me as the uncleanness H2932 of a removed woman H5079.
036:018 Wherefore I poured H8210 (8799) my fury H2534 upon them for the blood H1818 that they had shed H8210 (8804) upon the land H0776, and for their idols H1544 [wherewith] they had polluted H2930 (8765) it:
036:019 And I scattered H6327 (8686) them among the heathen H1471, and they were dispersed H2219 (8735) through the countries H0776: according to their way H1870 and according to their doings H5949 I judged H8199 (8804) them.
036:020 And when they entered H0935 (8799) unto the heathen H1471, whither they went H0935 (8804), they profaned H2490 (8762) my holy H6944 name H8034, when they said H0559 (8800) to them, These [are] the people H5971 of the LORD H3068, and are gone forth H3318 (8804) out of his land H0776.
036:021 But I had pity H2550 (8799) for mine holy H6944 name H8034, which the house H1004 of Israel H3478 had profaned H2490 (8765) among the heathen H1471, whither they went H0935 (8804).
036:022 Therefore say H0559 (8798) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I do H6213 (8802) not [this] for your sakes, O house H1004 of Israel H3478, but for mine holy H6944 name’s H8034 sake, which ye have profaned H2490 (8765) among the heathen H1471, whither ye went H0935 (8804).
036:023 And I will sanctify H6942 (8765) my great H1419 name H8034, which was profaned H2490 (8794) among the heathen H1471, which ye have profaned H2490 (8765) in the midst H8432 of them; and the heathen H1471 shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, when I shall be sanctified H6942 (8736) in you before their eyes H5869.
036:024 For I will take H3947 (8804) you from among H4480 the heathen H1471, and gather H6908 (8765) you out of all countries H0776, and will bring H0935 (8689) you into your own land H0127.
036:025 Then will I sprinkle H2236 (8804) clean H2889 water H4325 upon you, and ye shall be clean H2891 (8804): from all your filthiness H2932, and from all your idols H1544, will I cleanse H2891 (8762) you.
036:026 A new H2319 heart H3820 also will I give H5414 (8804) you, and a new H2319 spirit H7307 will I put H5414 (8799) within H7130 you: and I will take away H5493 (8689) the stony H0068 heart H3820 out of your flesh H1320, and I will give H5414 (8804) you an heart H3820 of flesh H1320.
036:027 And I will put H5414 (8799) my spirit H7307 within H7130 you, and cause H6213 (8804) you to walk H3212 (8799) in my statutes H2706, and ye shall keep H8104 (8799) my judgments H4941, and do H6213 (8804) [them].
036:028 And ye shall dwell H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 that I gave H5414 (8804) to your fathers H0001; and ye shall be my people H5971, and I will be your God H0430.
036:029 I will also save H3467 (8689) you from all your uncleannesses H2932: and I will call H7121 (8804) for the corn H1715, and will increase H7235 (8689) it, and lay H5414 (8799) no famine H7458 upon you.
036:030 And I will multiply H7235 (8689) the fruit H6529 of the tree H6086, and the increase H8570 of the field H7704, that ye shall receive H3947 (8799) no more reproach H2781 of famine H7458 among the heathen H1471.
036:031 Then shall ye remember H2142 (8804) your own evil H7451 ways H1870, and your doings H4611 that [were] not good H2896, and shall lothe H6962 (8738) yourselves in your own sight H6440 for your iniquities H5771 and for your abominations H8441.
036:032 Not for your sakes do H6213 (8802) I [this], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, be it known H3045 (8735) unto you: be ashamed H0954 (8798) and confounded H3637 (8734) for your own ways H1870, O house H1004 of Israel H3478.
036:033 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; In the day H3117 that I shall have cleansed H2891 (8763) you from all your iniquities H5771 I will also cause [you] to dwell H3427 (8689) in the cities H5892, and the wastes H2723 shall be builded H1129 (8738).
036:034 And the desolate H8074 (8737) land H0776 shall be tilled H5647 (8735), whereas it lay desolate H8077 in the sight H5869 of all that passed by H5674 (8802).
036:035 And they shall say H0559 (8804), This H1977 land H0776 that was desolate H8074 (8737) is become like the garden H1588 of Eden H5731; and the waste H2720 and desolate H8074 (8737) and ruined H2040 (8737) cities H5892 [are become] fenced H1219 (8803), [and] are inhabited H3427 (8804).
036:036 Then the heathen H1471 that are left H7604 (8735) round about H5439 you shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 build H1129 (8804) the ruined H2040 (8737) [places, and] plant H5193 (8804) that that was desolate H8074 (8737): I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], and I will do H6213 (8804) [it].
036:037 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; I will yet [for] this be enquired H1875 (8735) of by the house H1004 of Israel H3478, to do H6213 (8800) [it] for them; I will increase H7235 (8686) them with men H0120 like a flock H6629.
036:038 As the holy H6944 flock H6629, as the flock H6629 of Jerusalem H3389 in her solemn feasts H4150; so shall the waste H2720 cities H5892 be filled H4392 with flocks H6629 of men H0120: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
037:001 ¶ The hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was upon me, and carried me out H3318 (8686) in the spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068, and set me down H5117 (8686) in the midst H8432 of the valley H1237 which [was] full H4392 of bones H6106,
037:002 And caused me to pass H5674 (8689) by them round about H5439: and, behold, [there were] very H3966 many H7227 in the open H6440 valley H1237; and, lo, [they were] very H3966 dry H3002.
037:003 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, can these bones H6106 live H2421 (8799)? And I answered H0559 (8799), O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, thou knowest H3045 (8804).
037:004 Again he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Prophesy H5012 (8734) upon these bones H6106, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, O ye dry H3002 bones H6106, hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
037:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 unto these bones H6106; Behold, I will cause breath H7307 to enter H0935 (8688) into you, and ye shall live H2421 (8804):
037:006 And I will lay H5414 (8804) sinews H1517 upon you, and will bring up H5927 (8689) flesh H1320 upon you, and cover H7159 (8804) you with skin H5785, and put H5414 (8804) breath H7307 in you, and ye shall live H2421 (8804); and ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
037:007 So I prophesied H5012 (8738) as I was commanded H6680 (8795): and as I prophesied H5012 (8736), there was a noise H6963, and behold a shaking H7494, and the bones H6106 came together H7126 (8799), bone H6106 to his bone H6106.
037:008 And when I beheld H7200 (8804), lo, the sinews H1517 and the flesh H1320 came up H5927 (8804) upon them, and the skin H5785 covered H7159 (8799) them above H4605: but [there was] no breath H7307 in them.
037:009 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Prophesy H5012 (8734) unto the wind H7307, prophesy H5012 (8734), son H1121 of man H0120, and say H0559 (8804) to the wind H7307, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Come H0935 (8798) from the four H0702 winds H7307, O breath H7307, and breathe H5301 (8798) upon these slain H2026 (8803), that they may live H2421 (8799).
037:010 So I prophesied H5012 (8694) as he commanded H6680 (8765) me, and the breath H7307 came H0935 (8799) into them, and they lived H2421 (8799), and stood up H5975 (8799) upon their feet H7272, an exceeding H3966 H3966 great H1419 army H2428.
037:011 Then he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, these bones H6106 are the whole house H1004 of Israel H3478: behold, they say H0559 (8802), Our bones H6106 are dried H3001 (8804), and our hope H8615 is lost H0006 (8804): we are cut off H1504 (8738) for our parts.
037:012 Therefore prophesy H5012 (8734) and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, O my people H5971, I will open H6605 (8802) your graves H6913, and cause you to come up H5927 (8689) out of your graves H6913, and bring H0935 (8689) you into the land H0127 of Israel H3478.
037:013 And ye shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, when I have opened H6605 (8800) your graves H6913, O my people H5971, and brought you up H5927 (8687) out of your graves H6913,
037:014 And shall put H5414 (8804) my spirit H7307 in you, and ye shall live H2421 (8804), and I shall place H3240 (8689) you in your own land H0127: then shall ye know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], and performed H6213 (8804) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
037:015 The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came again unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
037:016 Moreover, thou son H1121 of man H0120, take H3947 (8798) thee one H0259 stick H6086, and write H3789 (8798) upon it, For Judah H3063, and for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 his companions H2270: then take H3947 (8798) another H0259 stick H6086, and write H3789 (8798) upon it, For Joseph H3130, the stick H6086 of Ephraim H0669, and [for] all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 his companions H2270:
037:017 And join H7126 (8761) them one H0259 to another H0259 into one H0259 stick H6086; and they shall become one H0259 in thine hand H3027.
037:018 And when the children H1121 of thy people H5971 shall speak H0559 (8799) unto thee, saying H0559 (8800), Wilt thou not shew H5046 (8686) us what thou [meanest] by these?
037:019 Say H1696 (8761) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will take H3947 (8802) the stick H6086 of Joseph H3130, which [is] in the hand H3027 of Ephraim H0669, and the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 his fellows H2270, and will put H5414 (8804) them with him, [even] with the stick H6086 of Judah H3063, and make H6213 (8804) them one H0259 stick H6086, and they shall be one H0259 in mine hand H3027.
037:020 And the sticks H6086 whereon thou writest H3789 (8799) shall be in thine hand H3027 before their eyes H5869.
037:021 And say H1696 (8761) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I will take H3947 (8802) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 from among H0996 the heathen H1471, whither they be gone H1980 (8804), and will gather H6908 (8765) them on every side H5439, and bring H0935 (8689) them into their own land H0127:
037:022 And I will make H6213 (8804) them one H0259 nation H1471 in the land H0776 upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478; and one H0259 king H4428 shall be king H4428 to them all: and they shall be H5750 no more two H8147 nations H1471, neither shall they be divided H2673 (8735) into two H8147 kingdoms H4467 any more at all:
037:023 Neither shall they defile H2930 (8691) themselves any more with their idols H1544, nor with their detestable things H8251, nor with any of their transgressions H6588: but I will save H3467 (8689) them out of all their dwellingplaces H4186, wherein they have sinned H2398 (8804), and will cleanse H2891 (8765) them: so shall they be my people H5971, and I will be their God H0430.
037:024 And David H1732 my servant H5650 [shall be] king H4428 over them; and they all shall have one H0259 shepherd H7462 (8802): they shall also walk H3212 (8799) in my judgments H4941, and observe H8104 (8799) my statutes H2708, and do H6213 (8804) them.
037:025 And they shall dwell H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 that I have given H5414 (8804) unto Jacob H3290 my servant H5650, wherein your fathers H0001 have dwelt H3427 (8804); and they shall dwell H3427 (8804) therein, [even] they, and their children H1121, and their children’s H1121 children H1121 for ever H5769: and my servant H5650 David H1732 [shall be] their prince H5387 for H5704 ever H5769.
037:026 Moreover I will make H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 of peace H7965 with them; it shall be an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285 with them: and I will place H5414 (8804) them, and multiply H7235 (8689) them, and will set H5414 (8804) my sanctuary H4720 in the midst H8432 of them for evermore H5769.
037:027 My tabernacle H4908 also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God H0430, and they shall be my people H5971.
037:028 And the heathen H1471 shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 do sanctify H6942 (8764) Israel H3478, when my sanctuary H4720 shall be in the midst H8432 of them for evermore H5769.
038:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
038:002 Son H1121 of man H0120, set H7760 (8798) thy face H6440 against Gog H1463, the land H0776 of Magog H4031, the chief H7218 prince H5387 of Meshech H4902 and Tubal H8422, and prophesy H5012 (8734) against him,
038:003 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog H1463, the chief H7218 prince H5387 of Meshech H4902 and Tubal H8422:
038:004 And I will turn thee back H7725 (8790), and put H5414 (8804) hooks H2397 into thy jaws H3895, and I will bring thee forth H3318 (8689), and all thine army H2428, horses H5483 and horsemen H6571, all of them clothed H3847 (8803) with all sorts H4358 [of armour, even] a great H7227 company H6951 [with] bucklers H6793 and shields H4043, all of them handling H8610 (8802) swords H2719:
038:005 Persia H6539, Ethiopia H3568, and Libya H6316 with them; all of them with shield H4043 and helmet H3553:
038:006 Gomer H1586, and all his bands H0102; the house H1004 of Togarmah H8425 of the north H6828 quarters H3411, and all his bands H0102: [and] many H7227 people H5971 with thee.
038:007 Be thou prepared H3559 (8734), and prepare H3559 (8685) for thyself, thou, and all thy company H6951 that are assembled H6950 (8737) unto thee, and be thou a guard H4929 unto them.
038:008 After many H7227 days H3117 thou shalt be visited H6485 (8735): in the latter H0319 years H8141 thou shalt come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 [that is] brought back H7725 (8796) from the sword H2719, [and is] gathered H6908 (8794) out of many H7227 people H5971, against the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, which have been always H8548 waste H2723: but it is brought forth H3318 (8717) out of the nations H5971, and they shall dwell H3427 (8804) safely H0983 all of them.
038:009 Thou shalt ascend H5927 (8804) and come H0935 (8799) like a storm H7722, thou shalt be like a cloud H6051 to cover H3680 (8763) the land H0776, thou, and all thy bands H0102, and many H7227 people H5971 with thee.
038:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same time H3117 shall things H1697 come H5927 (8799) into thy mind H3824, and thou shalt think H2803 (8804) an evil H7451 thought H4284:
038:011 And thou shalt say H0559 (8804), I will go up H5927 (8799) to the land H0776 of unwalled villages H6519; I will go H0935 (8799) to them that are at rest H8252 (8802), that dwell H3427 (8802) safely H0983, all of them dwelling H3427 (8802) without walls H2346, and having neither bars H1280 nor gates H1817,
038:012 To take H7997 (8800) a spoil H7998, and to take H0962 (8800) a prey H0957; to turn H7725 (8687) thine hand H3027 upon the desolate places H2723 [that are now] inhabited H3427 (8737), and upon the people H5971 [that are] gathered H0622 (8794) out of the nations H1471, which have gotten H6213 (8802) cattle H4735 and goods H7075, that dwell H3427 (8802) in the midst H2872 of the land H0776.
038:013 Sheba H7614, and Dedan H1719, and the merchants H5503 (8802) of Tarshish H8659, with all the young lions H3715 thereof, shall say H0559 (8799) unto thee, Art thou come H0935 (8802) to take H7997 (8800) a spoil H7998? hast thou gathered H6950 (8689) thy company H6951 to take H0962 (8800) a prey H0957? to carry away H5375 (8800) silver H3701 and gold H2091, to take away H3947 (8800) cattle H4735 and goods H7075, to take H7997 (8800) a great H1419 spoil H7998?
038:014 Therefore, son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) and say H0559 (8804) unto Gog H1463, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; In that day H3117 when my people H5971 of Israel H3478 dwelleth H3427 (8800) safely H0983, shalt thou not know H3045 (8799) [it]?
038:015 And thou shalt come H0935 (8804) from thy place H4725 out of the north H6828 parts H3411, thou, and many H7227 people H5971 with thee, all of them riding H7392 (8802) upon horses H5483, a great H1419 company H6951, and a mighty H7227 army H2428:
038:016 And thou shalt come up H5927 (8804) against my people H5971 of Israel H3478, as a cloud H6051 to cover H3680 (8763) the land H0776; it shall be in the latter H0319 days H3117, and I will bring H0935 (8689) thee against my land H0776, that the heathen H1471 may know H3045 (8800) me, when I shall be sanctified H6942 (8736) in thee, O Gog H1463, before their eyes H5869.
038:017 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; [Art] thou he of whom I have spoken H1696 (8765) in old H6931 time H3117 by H3027 my servants H5650 the prophets H5030 of Israel H3478, which prophesied H5012 (8737) in those days H3117 [many] years H8141 that I would bring H0935 (8687) thee against them?
038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time H3117 when H3117 Gog H1463 shall come H0935 (8800) against the land H0127 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, [that] my fury H2534 shall come up H5927 (8799) in my face H0639.
038:019 For in my jealousy H7068 [and] in the fire H0784 of my wrath H5678 have I spoken H1696 (8765), Surely in that day H3117 there shall be a great H1419 shaking H7494 in the land H0127 of Israel H3478;
038:020 So that the fishes H1709 of the sea H3220, and the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, and the beasts H2416 of the field H7704, and all creeping things H7431 that creep H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0127, and all the men H0120 that [are] upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127, shall shake H7493 (8804) at my presence H6440, and the mountains H2022 shall be thrown down H2040 (8738), and the steep places H4095 shall fall H5307 (8804), and every wall H2346 shall fall H5307 (8799) to the ground H0776.
038:021 And I will call H7121 (8804) for a sword H2719 against him throughout all my mountains H2022, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: every man’s H0376 sword H2719 shall be against his brother H0251.
038:022 And I will plead H8199 (8738) against him with pestilence H1698 and with blood H1818; and I will rain H4305 (8686) upon him, and upon his bands H0102, and upon the many H7227 people H5971 that [are] with him, an overflowing H7857 (8802) rain H1653, and great hailstones H0417 H0068, fire H0784, and brimstone H1614.
038:023 Thus will I magnify H1431 (8694) myself, and sanctify H6942 (8694) myself; and I will be known H3045 (8738) in the eyes H5869 of many H7227 nations H1471, and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
039:001 ¶ Therefore, thou son H1121 of man H0120, prophesy H5012 (8734) against Gog H1463, and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog H1463, the chief H7218 prince H5387 of Meshech H4902 and Tubal H8422:
039:002 And I will turn thee back H7725 (8790), and leave but the sixth part H8338 (8765) of thee, and will cause thee to come up H5927 (8689) from the north H6828 parts H3411, and will bring H0935 (8689) thee upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478:
039:003 And I will smite H5221 (8689) thy bow H7198 out of thy left H8040 hand H3027, and will cause thine arrows H2671 to fall H5307 (8686) out of thy right H3225 hand H3027.
039:004 Thou shalt fall H5307 (8799) upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, thou, and all thy bands H0102, and the people H5971 that [is] with thee: I will give H5414 (8804) thee unto the ravenous H5861 birds H6833 of every sort H3671, and [to] the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 to be devoured H0402.
039:005 Thou shalt fall H5307 (8799) upon the open H6440 field H7704: for I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
039:006 And I will send H7971 (8765) a fire H0784 on Magog H4031, and among them that dwell H3427 (8802) carelessly H0983 in the isles H0339: and they shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068.
039:007 So will I make my holy H6944 name H8034 known H3045 (8686) in the midst H8432 of my people H5971 Israel H3478; and I will not [let them] pollute H2490 (8686) my holy H6944 name H8034 any more: and the heathen H1471 shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068, the Holy One H6918 in Israel H3478.
039:008 Behold, it is come H0935 (8804), and it is done H1961 (8738), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; this [is] the day H3117 whereof I have spoken H1696 (8765).
039:009 And they that dwell H3427 (8802) in the cities H5892 of Israel H3478 shall go forth H3318 (8804), and shall set H1197 (8765) on fire H0784 and burn H5400 (8689) the weapons H5402, both the shields H4043 and the bucklers H6793, the bows H7198 and the arrows H2671, and the handstaves H3027 H4731, and the spears H7420, and they shall burn H1197 (8765) them with fire H0784 seven H7651 years H8141:
039:010 So that they shall take H5375 (8799) no wood H6086 out of the field H7704, neither cut down H2404 (8799) [any] out of the forests H3293; for they shall burn H1197 (8762) the weapons H5402 with fire H0784: and they shall spoil H7997 (8804) those that spoiled H7997 (8802) them, and rob H0962 (8804) those that robbed H0962 (8802) them, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] I will give H5414 (8799) unto Gog H1463 a place H4725 there of graves H6913 in Israel H3478, the valley H1516 of the passengers H5674 (8802) on the east H6926 of the sea H3220: and it shall stop H2629 (8802) the [noses] of the passengers H5674 (8802): and there shall they bury H6912 (8804) Gog H1463 and all his multitude H1995: and they shall call H7121 (8804) [it] The valley H1516 of Hamongog H1996.
039:012 And seven H7651 months H2320 shall the house H1004 of Israel H3478 be burying H6912 (8804) of them, that they may cleanse H2891 (8763) the land H0776.
039:013 Yea, all the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall bury H6912 (8804) [them]; and it shall be to them a renown H8034 the day H3117 that I shall be glorified H3513 (8736), saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
039:014 And they shall sever out H0914 (8686) men H0582 of continual employment H8548, passing through H5674 (8802) the land H0776 to bury H6912 (8764) with the passengers H5674 (8802) those that remain H3498 (8737) upon the face H6440 of the earth H0776, to cleanse H2891 (8763) it: after the end H7097 of seven H7651 months H2320 shall they search H2713 (8799).
039:015 And the passengers H5674 (8802) [that] pass through H5674 (8804) the land H0776, when [any] seeth H7200 (8804) a man’s H0120 bone H6106, then shall he set up H1129 (8804) a sign H6725 by H0681 it, till the buriers H6912 (8764) have buried H6912 (8804) it in the valley H1516 of Hamongog H1996.
039:016 And also the name H8034 of the city H5892 [shall be] Hamonah H1997. Thus shall they cleanse H2891 (8765) the land H0776.
039:017 And, thou son H1121 of man H0120, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Speak H0559 (8798) unto every feathered H3671 fowl H6833, and to every beast H2416 of the field H7704, Assemble H6908 (8734) yourselves, and come H0935 (8798); gather H0622 (8734) yourselves on every side H5439 to my sacrifice H2077 that I do sacrifice H2076 (8802) for you, [even] a great H1419 sacrifice H2077 upon the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478, that ye may eat H0398 (8804) flesh H1320, and drink H8354 (8804) blood H1818.
039:018 Ye shall eat H0398 (8799) the flesh H1320 of the mighty H1368, and drink H8354 (8799) the blood H1818 of the princes H5387 of the earth H0776, of rams H0352, of lambs H3733, and of goats H6260, of bullocks H6499, all of them fatlings H4806 of Bashan H1316.
039:019 And ye shall eat H0398 (8804) fat H2459 till ye be full H7654, and drink H8354 (8804) blood H1818 till ye be drunken H7943, of my sacrifice H2077 which I have sacrificed H2076 (8804) for you.
039:020 Thus ye shall be filled H7646 (8804) at my table H7979 with horses H5483 and chariots H7393, with mighty men H1368, and with all men H0376 of war H4421, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
039:021 And I will set H5414 (8804) my glory H3519 among the heathen H1471, and all the heathen H1471 shall see H7200 (8804) my judgment H4941 that I have executed H6213 (8804), and my hand H3027 that I have laid H7760 (8804) upon them.
039:022 So the house H1004 of Israel H3478 shall know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068 their God H0430 from that day H3117 and forward H1973.
039:023 And the heathen H1471 shall know H3045 (8804) that the house H1004 of Israel H3478 went into captivity H1540 (8804) for their iniquity H5771: because they trespassed H4603 (8804) against me, therefore hid H5641 (8686) I my face H6440 from them, and gave H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of their enemies H6862: so fell H5307 (8799) they all by the sword H2719.
039:024 According to their uncleanness H2932 and according to their transgressions H6588 have I done H6213 (8804) unto them, and hid H5641 (8686) my face H6440 from them.
039:025 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Now will I bring again H7725 (8686) the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of Jacob H3290, and have mercy H7355 (8765) upon the whole house H1004 of Israel H3478, and will be jealous H7065 (8765) for my holy H6944 name H8034;
039:026 After that they have borne H5375 (8804) their shame H3639, and all their trespasses H4604 whereby they have trespassed H4603 (8804) against me, when they dwelt H3427 (8800) safely H0983 in their land H0127, and none made [them] afraid H2729 (8688).
039:027 When I have brought them again H7725 (8788) from the people H5971, and gathered H6908 (8765) them out of their enemies H0341 (8802) ’ lands H0776, and am sanctified H6942 (8738) in them in the sight H5869 of many H7227 nations H1471;
039:028 Then shall they know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068 their God H0430, which caused them to be led into captivity H1540 (8687) among the heathen H1471: but I have gathered H3664 (8765) them unto their own land H0127, and have left H3498 (8686) none of them any more there.
039:029 Neither will I hide H5641 (8686) my face H6440 any more from them: for I have poured out H8210 (8804) my spirit H7307 upon the house H1004 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
040:001 ¶ In the five H2568 and twentieth H6242 year H8141 of our captivity H1546, in the beginning H7218 of the year H8141, in the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, in the fourteenth H0702 H6240 year H8141 after H0310 that the city H5892 was smitten H5221 (8717), in the selfsame H6106 day H3117 the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was upon me, and brought H0935 (8686) me thither.
040:002 In the visions H4759 of God H0430 brought H0935 (8689) he me into the land H0776 of Israel H3478, and set H5117 (8686) me upon a very H3966 high H1364 mountain H2022, by which [was] as the frame H4011 of a city H5892 on the south H5045.
040:003 And he brought H0935 (8686) me thither, and, behold, [there was] a man H0376, whose appearance H4758 [was] like the appearance H4758 of brass H5178, with a line H6616 of flax H6593 in his hand H3027, and a measuring H4060 reed H7070; and he stood H5975 (8802) in the gate H8179.
040:004 And the man H0376 said H1696 (8762) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, behold H7200 (8798) with thine eyes H5869, and hear H8085 (8798) with thine ears H0241, and set H7760 (8798) thine heart H3820 upon all that I shall shew H7200 (8688) thee; for to the intent H4616 that I might shew H7200 (8687) [them] unto thee [art] thou brought H0935 (8717) hither: declare H5046 (8685) all that thou seest H7200 (8802) to the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
040:005 And behold a wall H2346 on the outside H2351 of the house H1004 round about H5439, and in the man’s H0376 hand H3027 a measuring H4060 reed H7070 of six H8337 cubits H0520 [long] by the cubit H0520 and an hand breadth H2948: so he measured H4058 (8799) the breadth H7341 of the building H1146, one H0259 reed H7070; and the height H6967, one H0259 reed H7070.
040:006 Then came H0935 (8799) he unto the gate H8179 which looketh H6440 toward H1870 the east H6921, and went up H5927 (8799) the stairs H4609 thereof, and measured H4058 (8799) the threshold H5592 of the gate H8179, [which was] one H0259 reed H7070 broad H7341; and the other H0259 threshold H5592 [of the gate, which was] one H0259 reed H7070 broad H7341.
040:007 And [every] little chamber H8372 [was] one H0259 reed H7070 long H0753, and one H0259 reed H7070 broad H7341; and between the little chambers H8372 [were] five H2568 cubits H0520; and the threshold H5592 of the gate H8179 by H0681 the porch H0197 of the gate H8179 within H1004 [was] one H0259 reed H7070.
040:008 He measured H4058 (8799) also the porch H0197 of the gate H8179 within H1004, one H0259 reed H7070.
040:009 Then measured H4058 (8799) he the porch H0197 of the gate H8179, eight H8083 cubits H0520; and the posts H0352 thereof, two H8147 cubits H0520; and the porch H0197 of the gate H8179 [was] inward H1004.
040:010 And the little chambers H8372 of the gate H8179 eastward H1870 H6921 [were] three H7969 on this side H6311, and three H7969 on that side H6311; they three H7969 [were] of one H0259 measure H4060: and the posts H0352 had one H0259 measure H4060 on this side and on that side.
040:011 And he measured H4058 (8799) the breadth H7341 of the entry H6607 of the gate H8179, ten H6235 cubits H0520; [and] the length H0753 of the gate H8179, thirteen H7969 H6240 cubits H0520.
040:012 The space H1366 also before H6440 the little chambers H8372 [was] one H0259 cubit H0520 [on this side], and the space H1366 [was] one cubit H0520 on that side: and the little chambers H8372 [were] six H8337 cubits H0520 on this side, and six H8337 cubits H0520 on that side.
040:013 He measured H4058 (8799) then the gate H8179 from the roof H1406 of [one] little chamber H8372 to the roof H1406 of another: the breadth H7341 [was] five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520, door H6607 against door H6607.
040:014 He made H6213 (8799) also posts H0352 of threescore H8346 cubits H0520, even unto the post H0352 of the court H2691 round about H5439 the gate H8179.
040:015 And from the face H6440 of the gate H8179 of the entrance H2978 unto the face H6440 of the porch H0197 of the inner H6442 gate H8179 [were] fifty H2572 cubits H0520.
040:016 And [there were] narrow H0331 (8801) windows H2474 to the little chambers H8372, and to their posts H0352 within H6441 the gate H8179 round about H5439, and likewise to the arches H0361: and windows H2474 [were] round about H5439 inward H6441: and upon [each] post H0352 [were] palm trees H8561.
040:017 Then brought H0935 (8686) he me into the outward H2435 court H2691, and, lo, [there were] chambers H3957, and a pavement H7531 made H6213 (8803) for the court H2691 round about H5439: thirty H7970 chambers H3957 [were] upon the pavement H7531.
040:018 And the pavement H7531 by the side H3802 of the gates H8179 over against H5980 the length H0753 of the gates H8179 [was] the lower H8481 pavement H7531.
040:019 Then he measured H4058 (8799) the breadth H7341 from the forefront H6440 of the lower H8481 gate H8179 unto the forefront H6440 of the inner H6442 court H2691 without H2351, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 eastward H6921 and northward H6828.
040:020 And the gate H8179 of the outward H2435 court H2691 that looked H6440 toward H1870 the north H6828, he measured H4058 (8804) the length H0753 thereof, and the breadth H7341 thereof.
040:021 And the little chambers H8372 thereof [were] three H7969 on this side and three H7969 on that side; and the posts H0352 thereof and the arches H0361 thereof were after the measure H4060 of the first H7223 gate H8179: the length H0753 thereof [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520.
040:022 And their windows H2474, and their arches H0361, and their palm trees H8561, [were] after the measure H4060 of the gate H8179 that looketh H6440 toward H1870 the east H6921; and they went up H5927 (8799) unto it by seven H7651 steps H4609; and the arches H0361 thereof [were] before H6440 them.
040:023 And the gate H8179 of the inner H6442 court H2691 [was] over against the gate H8179 toward the north H6828, and toward the east H6921; and he measured H4058 (8799) from gate H8179 to gate H8179 an hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
040:024 After that he brought H3212 (8686) me toward H1870 the south H1864, and behold a gate H8179 toward H1870 the south H1864: and he measured H4058 (8804) the posts H0352 thereof and the arches H0361 thereof according to these measures H4060.
040:025 And [there were] windows H2474 in it and in the arches H0361 thereof round about H5439, like those windows H2474: the length H0753 [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520.
040:026 And [there were] seven H7651 steps H4609 to go up H5930 to it, and the arches H0361 thereof [were] before H6440 them: and it had palm trees H8561, one H0259 on this side, and another H0259 on that side, upon the posts H0352 thereof.
040:027 And [there was] a gate H8179 in the inner H6442 court H2691 toward H1870 the south H1864: and he measured H4058 (8799) from gate H8179 to gate H8179 toward H1870 the south H1864 an hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
040:028 And he brought H0935 (8686) me to the inner H6442 court H2691 by the south H1864 gate H8179: and he measured H4058 (8799) the south H1864 gate H8179 according to these measures H4060;
040:029 And the little chambers H8372 thereof, and the posts H0352 thereof, and the arches H0361 thereof, according to these measures H4060: and [there were] windows H2474 in it and in the arches H0361 thereof round about H5439: [it was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520 long H0753, and five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520 broad H7341.

040:031 And the arches H0361 thereof [were] toward the utter H2435 court H2691; and palm trees H8561 [were] upon the posts H0352 thereof: and the going up H4608 to it [had] eight H8083 steps H4609.
040:032 And he brought H0935 (8686) me into the inner H6442 court H2691 toward H1870 the east H6921: and he measured H4058 (8799) the gate H8179 according to these measures H4060.
040:033 And the little chambers H8372 thereof, and the posts H0352 thereof, and the arches H0361 thereof, [were] according to these measures H4060: and [there were] windows H2474 therein and in the arches H0361 thereof round about H5439: [it was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520 long H0753, and five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520 broad H7341.
040:034 And the arches H0361 thereof [were] toward the outward H2435 court H2691; and palm trees H8561 [were] upon the posts H0352 thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up H4608 to it [had] eight H8083 steps H4609.
040:035 And he brought H0935 (8686) me to the north H6828 gate H8179, and measured H4058 (8804) [it] according to these measures H4060;
040:036 The little chambers H8372 thereof, the posts H0352 thereof, and the arches H0361 thereof, and the windows H2474 to it round about H5439: the length H0753 [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 five H2568 and twenty H6242 cubits H0520.
040:037 And the posts H0352 thereof [were] toward the utter H2435 court H2691; and palm trees H8561 [were] upon the posts H0352 thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up H4608 to it [had] eight H8083 steps H4609.
040:038 And the chambers H3957 and the entries H6607 thereof [were] by the posts H0352 of the gates H8179, where they washed H1740 (8686) the burnt offering H5930.
040:039 And in the porch H0197 of the gate H8179 [were] two H8147 tables H7979 on this side, and two tables H7979 on that side, to slay H7819 (8800) thereon the burnt offering H5930 and the sin offering H2403 and the trespass offering H0817.
040:040 And at the side H3802 without H2351, as one goeth up H5927 (8802) to the entry H6607 of the north H6828 gate H8179, [were] two H8147 tables H7979; and on the other H0312 side H3802, which [was] at the porch H0197 of the gate H8179, [were] two H8147 tables H7979.
040:041 Four H0702 tables H7979 [were] on this side, and four H0702 tables H7979 on that side, by the side H3802 of the gate H8179; eight H8083 tables H7979, whereupon they slew H7819 (8799) [their sacrifices].
040:042 And the four H0702 tables H7979 [were] of hewn H1496 stone H0068 for the burnt offering H5930, of a cubit H0520 and an half H2677 long H0753, and a cubit H0520 and an half H2677 broad H7341, and one H0259 cubit H0520 high H1363: whereupon also they laid H3240 (8686) the instruments H3627 wherewith they slew H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930 and the sacrifice H2077.
040:043 And within H1004 [were] hooks H8240, an H0259 hand H2948 broad, fastened H3559 (8716) round about H5439: and upon the tables H7979 [was] the flesh H1320 of the offering H7133.
040:044 And without H2351 the inner H6442 gate H8179 [were] the chambers H3957 of the singers H7891 (8802) in the inner H6442 court H2691, which [was] at the side H3802 of the north H6828 gate H8179; and their prospect H6440 [was] toward H1870 the south H1864: one H0259 at the side H3802 of the east H6921 gate H8179 [having] the prospect H6440 toward H1870 the north H6828.
040:045 And he said H1696 (8762) unto me, This H2090 chamber H3957, whose prospect H6440 [is] toward H1870 the south H1864, [is] for the priests H3548, the keepers H8104 (8802) of the charge H4931 of the house H1004.
040:046 And the chamber H3957 whose prospect H6440 [is] toward H1870 the north H6828 [is] for the priests H3548, the keepers H8104 (8802) of the charge H4931 of the altar H4196: these [are] the sons H1121 of Zadok H6659 among the sons H1121 of Levi H3878, which come near H7131 to the LORD H3068 to minister H8334 (8763) unto him.
040:047 So he measured H4058 (8799) the court H2691, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 long H0753, and an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 broad H7341, foursquare H7251 (8794); and the altar H4196 [that was] before H6440 the house H1004.
040:048 And he brought H0935 (8686) me to the porch H0197 of the house H1004, and measured H4058 (8799) [each] post H0352 of the porch H0197, five H2568 cubits H0520 on this side, and five H2568 cubits H0520 on that side: and the breadth H7341 of the gate H8179 [was] three H7969 cubits H0520 on this side, and three H7969 cubits H0520 on that side.
040:049 The length H0753 of the porch H0197 [was] twenty H6242 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 eleven H6249 H6240 cubits H0520; and [he brought me] by the steps H4609 whereby they went up H5927 (8799) to it: and [there were] pillars H5982 by the posts H0352, one H0259 on this side, and another H0259 on that side.
041:001 ¶ Afterward he brought H0935 (8686) me to the temple H1964, and measured H4058 (8799) the posts H0352, six H8337 cubits H0520 broad H7341 on the one side H6311, and six H8337 cubits H0520 broad H7341 on the other side H6311, [which was] the breadth H7341 of the tabernacle H0168.
041:002 And the breadth H7341 of the door H6607 [was] ten H6235 cubits H0520; and the sides H3802 of the door H6607 [were] five H2568 cubits H0520 on the one side, and five H2568 cubits H0520 on the other side: and he measured H4058 (8799) the length H0753 thereof, forty H0705 cubits H0520: and the breadth H7341, twenty H6242 cubits H0520.
041:003 Then went H0935 (8804) he inward H6441, and measured H4058 (8799) the post H0352 of the door H6607, two H8147 cubits H0520; and the door H6607, six H8337 cubits H0520; and the breadth H7341 of the door H6607, seven H7651 cubits H0520.
041:004 So he measured H4058 (8799) the length H0753 thereof, twenty H6242 cubits H0520; and the breadth H7341, twenty H6242 cubits H0520, before H6440 the temple H1964: and he said H0559 (8799) unto me, This [is] the most H6944 holy H6944 [place].
041:005 After he measured H4058 (8799) the wall H7023 of the house H1004, six H8337 cubits H0520; and the breadth H7341 of [every] side chamber H6763, four H0702 cubits H0520, round about H5439 the house H1004 on every side H5439.
041:006 And the side H6763 chambers H6763 [were] three H7969, one over another H6763, and thirty H7970 in order H6471; and they entered H0935 (8802) into the wall H7023 which [was] of the house H1004 for the side chambers H6763 round about H5439, that they might have hold H0270 (8803), but they had not hold H0270 (8803) in the wall H7023 of the house H1004.
041:007 And [there was] an enlarging H7337 (8804), and a winding about H5437 (8738) still upward H4605 to the side chambers H6763: for the winding about H4141 of the house H1004 went still upward H4605 round about H5439 the house H1004: therefore the breadth H7341 of the house H1004 [was still] upward H4605, and so increased H5927 (8799) [from] the lowest H8481 [chamber] to the highest H5945 by the midst H8484.
041:008 I saw H7200 (8804) also the height H1363 of the house H1004 round about H5439: the foundations H4328 of the side chambers H6763 [were] a full H4393 reed H7070 of six H8337 great H0679 cubits H0520.
041:009 The thickness H7341 of the wall H7023, which [was] for the side chamber H6763 without H2351, [was] five H2568 cubits H0520: and [that] which [was] left H3240 (8716) [was] the place H1004 of the side chambers H6763 that [were] within H1004.
041:010 And between the chambers H3957 [was] the wideness H7341 of twenty H6242 cubits H0520 round about H5439 the house H1004 on every side H5439.
041:011 And the doors H6607 of the side chambers H6763 [were] toward [the place that was] left H3240 (8716), one H0259 door H6607 toward H1870 the north H6828, and another H0259 door H6607 toward the south H1864: and the breadth H7341 of the place H4725 that was left H3240 (8716) [was] five H2568 cubits H0520 round about H5439.
041:012 Now the building H1146 that [was] before H6440 the separate place H1508 at the end H6285 toward H1870 the west H3220 [was] seventy H7657 cubits H0520 broad H7341; and the wall H7023 of the building H1146 [was] five H2568 cubits H0520 thick H7341 round about H5439, and the length H0753 thereof ninety H8673 cubits H0520.
041:013 So he measured H4058 (8804) the house H1004, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 long H0753; and the separate place H1508, and the building H1140, with the walls H7023 thereof, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 long H0753;
041:014 Also the breadth H7341 of the face H6440 of the house H1004, and of the separate place H1508 toward the east H6921, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
041:015 And he measured H4058 (8804) the length H0753 of the building H1146 over against H6440 the separate place H1508 which [was] behind H0310 it, and the galleries H0862 thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred H3967 cubits H0520, with the inner H6442 temple H1964, and the porches H0197 of the court H2691;
041:016 The door posts H5592, and the narrow H0331 (8801) windows H2474, and the galleries H0862 round about H5439 on their three stories H7969, over against H5048 the door H5592, cieled H7824 with wood H6086 round about H5439, and from the ground H0776 up to the windows H2474, and the windows H2474 [were] covered H3680 (8794);
041:017 To that above the door H6607, even unto the inner H6442 house H1004, and without H2351, and by all the wall H7023 round about H5439 within H6442 and without H2435, by measure H4060.
041:018 And [it was] made H6213 (8803) with cherubims H3742 and palm trees H8561, so that a palm tree H8561 [was] between a cherub H3742 and a cherub H3742; and [every] cherub H3742 had two H8147 faces H6440;
041:019 So that the face H6440 of a man H0120 [was] toward the palm tree H8561 on the one side, and the face H6440 of a young lion H3715 toward the palm tree H8561 on the other side: [it was] made H6213 (8803) through all the house H1004 round about H5439.
041:020 From the ground H0776 unto above the door H6607 [were] cherubims H3742 and palm trees H8561 made H6213 (8803), and [on] the wall H7023 of the temple H1964.
041:021 The posts H4201 of the temple H1964 [were] squared H7251 (8803), [and] the face H6440 of the sanctuary H6944; the appearance H4758 [of the one] as the appearance H4758 [of the other].
041:022 The altar H4196 of wood H6086 [was] three H7969 cubits H0520 high H1364, and the length H0753 thereof two H8147 cubits H0520; and the corners H4740 thereof, and the length H0753 thereof, and the walls H7023 thereof, [were] of wood H6086: and he said H1696 (8762) unto me, This [is] the table H7979 that [is] before H6440 the LORD H3068.
041:023 And the temple H1964 and the sanctuary H6944 had two H8147 doors H1817.
041:024 And the doors H1817 had two H8147 leaves H1817 [apiece], two H8147 turning H4142 (8716) leaves H1817; two H8147 [leaves] for the one H0259 door H1817, and two H8147 leaves H1817 for the other H0312 [door].
041:025 And [there were] made H6213 (8803) on them, on the doors H1817 of the temple H1964, cherubims H3742 and palm trees H8561, like as [were] made H6213 (8803) upon the walls H7023; and [there were] thick H5646 planks H6086 upon the face H6440 of the porch H0197 without H2351.
041:026 And [there were] narrow H0331 (8801) windows H2474 and palm trees H8561 on the one side and on the other side, on the sides H3802 of the porch H0197, and [upon] the side chambers H6763 of the house H1004, and thick planks H5646.
042:001 ¶ Then he brought me forth H3318 (8686) into the utter H2435 court H2691, the way toward H1870 the north H6828: and he brought H0935 (8686) me into the chamber H3957 that [was] over against the separate place H1508, and which [was] before the building H1146 toward the north H6828.
042:002 Before H6440 the length H0753 of an hundred H3967 cubits H0520 [was] the north H6828 door H6607, and the breadth H7341 [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520.
042:003 Over against the twenty H6242 [cubits] which [were] for the inner H6442 court H2691, and over against the pavement H7531 which [was] for the utter H2435 court H2691, [was] gallery H0862 against H6440 gallery H0862 in three H7992 [stories].
042:004 And before H6440 the chambers H3957 [was] a walk H4109 of ten H6235 cubits H0520 breadth H7341 inward H6442, a way H1870 of one H0259 cubit H0520; and their doors H6607 toward the north H6828.
042:005 Now the upper H5945 chambers H3957 [were] shorter H7114 (8803): for the galleries H0862 were higher H0398 (8799) than these H2007, than the lower H8481, and than the middlemost H8484 of the building H1146.
042:006 For they [were] in three H8027 (8794) [stories], but had not pillars H5982 as the pillars H5982 of the courts H2691: therefore [the building] was straitened H0680 (8738) more than the lowest H8481 and the middlemost H8484 from the ground H0776.
042:007 And the wall H1447 that [was] without H2351 over against H5980 the chambers H3957, toward H1870 the utter H2435 court H2691 on the forepart H6440 of the chambers H3957, the length H0753 thereof [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520.
042:008 For the length H0753 of the chambers H3957 that [were] in the utter H2435 court H2691 [was] fifty H2572 cubits H0520: and, lo, before H6440 the temple H1964 [were] an hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
042:009 And from under these chambers H3957 [was] the entry H3996 (8675) H0935 (8688) on the east side H6921, as one goeth H0935 (8800) into them H2007 from the utter H2435 court H2691.
042:010 The chambers H3957 [were] in the thickness H7341 of the wall H1444 of the court H2691 toward H1870 the east H6921, over against H6440 the separate place H1508, and over against H6440 the building H1146.
042:011 And the way H1870 before H6440 them [was] like the appearance H4758 of the chambers H3957 which [were] toward H1870 the north H6828, as long as H0753 they, [and] as broad as H3651 H7341 they: and all their goings out H4161 [were] both according to their fashions H4941, and according to their doors H6607.
042:012 And according to the doors H6607 of the chambers H3957 that [were] toward H1870 the south H1864 [was] a door H6607 in the head H7218 of the way H1870, [even] the way H1870 directly H1903 before H6440 the wall H1448 toward H1870 the east H6921, as one entereth H0935 (8800) into them.
042:013 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, The north H6828 chambers H3957 [and] the south H1864 chambers H3957, which [are] before H6440 the separate place H1508, they [be] holy H6944 chambers H3957, where the priests H3548 that approach H7138 unto the LORD H3068 shall eat H0398 (8799) the most H6944 holy things H6944: there shall they lay H3240 (8686) the most H6944 holy things H6944, and the meat offering H4503, and the sin offering H2403, and the trespass offering H0817; for the place H4725 [is] holy H6918.
042:014 When the priests H3548 enter H0935 (8800) therein, then shall they not go out H3318 (8799) of the holy H6944 [place] into the utter H2435 court H2691, but there they shall lay H3240 (8686) their garments H0899 wherein they minister H8334 (8762); for they [are] holy H6944; and shall put H3847 (8804) (8675) H3847 (8799) on other H0312 garments H0899, and shall approach H7126 (8804) to [those things] which [are] for the people H5971.
042:015 Now when he had made an end H3615 (8765) of measuring H4060 the inner H6442 house H1004, he brought me forth H3318 (8689) toward H1870 the gate H8179 whose prospect H6440 [is] toward H1870 the east H6921, and measured H4058 (8804) it round about H5439.
042:016 He measured H4058 (8804) the east H6921 side H7307 with the measuring H4060 reed H7070, five H2568 (8675) H0520 hundred H3967 reeds H7070, with the measuring H4060 reed H7070 round about H5439.
042:017 He measured H4058 (8804) the north H6828 side H7307, five H2568 hundred H3967 reeds H7070, with the measuring H4060 reed H7070 round about H5439.
042:018 He measured H4058 (8804) the south H1864 side H7307, five H2568 hundred H3967 reeds H7070, with the measuring H4060 reed H7070.
042:019 He turned about H5437 (8804) to the west H3220 side H7307, [and] measured H4058 (8804) five H2568 hundred H3967 reeds H7070 with the measuring H4060 reed H7070.
042:020 He measured H4058 (8804) it by the four H0702 sides H7307: it had a wall H2346 round about H5439, five H2568 hundred H3967 [reeds] long H0753, and five H2568 hundred H3967 broad H7341, to make a separation H0914 (8687) between the sanctuary H6944 and the profane place H2455.
043:001 ¶ Afterward he brought H3212 (8686) me to the gate H8179, [even] the gate H8179 that looketh H6437 (8802) toward H1870 the east H6921:
043:002 And, behold, the glory H3519 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8804) from the way H1870 of the east H6921: and his voice H6963 [was] like a noise H6963 of many H7227 waters H4325: and the earth H0776 shined H0215 (8689) with his glory H3519.
043:003 And [it was] according to the appearance H4758 of the vision H4758 which I saw H7200 (8804), [even] according to the vision H4758 that I saw H7200 (8804) when I came H0935 (8800) to destroy H7843 (8763) the city H5892: and the visions H4759 [were] like the vision H4758 that I saw H7200 (8804) by the river H5104 Chebar H3529; and I fell H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440.
043:004 And the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8804) into the house H1004 by the way H1870 of the gate H8179 whose prospect H6440 [is] toward H1870 the east H6921.
043:005 So the spirit H7307 took me up H5375 (8799), and brought H0935 (8686) me into the inner H6442 court H2691; and, behold, the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 filled H4390 (8804) the house H1004.
043:006 And I heard H8085 (8799) [him] speaking H1696 (8693) unto me out of the house H1004; and the man H0376 stood H5975 (8802) by me H0681.
043:007 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, the place H4725 of my throne H3678, and the place H4725 of the soles H3709 of my feet H7272, where I will dwell H7931 (8799) in the midst H8432 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 for ever H5769, and my holy H6944 name H8034, shall the house H1004 of Israel H3478 no more defile H2930 (8762), [neither] they, nor their kings H4428, by their whoredom H2184, nor by the carcases H6297 of their kings H4428 in their high places H1116.
043:008 In their setting H5414 (8800) of their threshold H5592 by my thresholds H5592, and their post H4201 by H0681 my posts H4201, and the wall H7023 between me and them, they have even defiled H2930 (8765) my holy H6944 name H8034 by their abominations H8441 that they have committed H6213 (8804): wherefore I have consumed H3615 (8762) them in mine anger H0639.
043:009 Now let them put away H7368 their whoredom H2184, and the carcases H6297 of their kings H4428, far H7368 (8762) from me, and I will dwell H7931 (8804) in the midst H8432 of them for ever H5769.
043:010 Thou son H1121 of man H0120, shew H5046 (8685) the house H1004 to the house H1004 of Israel H3478, that they may be ashamed H3637 (8735) of their iniquities H5771: and let them measure H4058 (8804) the pattern H8508.
043:011 And if they be ashamed H3637 (8738) of all that they have done H6213 (8804), shew H3045 (8685) them the form H6699 of the house H1004, and the fashion H8498 thereof, and the goings out H4161 thereof, and the comings H4126 in thereof, and all the forms H6699 thereof, and all the ordinances H2708 thereof, and all the forms H6699 thereof, and all the laws H8451 thereof: and write H3789 (8798) [it] in their sight H5869, that they may keep H8104 (8799) the whole form H6699 thereof, and all the ordinances H2708 thereof, and do H6213 (8804) them.
043:012 This [is] the law H8451 of the house H1004; Upon the top H7218 of the mountain H2022 the whole limit H1366 thereof round about H5439 [shall be] most H6944 holy H6944. Behold, this [is] the law H8451 of the house H1004.
043:013 And these [are] the measures H4060 of the altar H4196 after the cubits H0520: The cubit H0520 [is] a cubit H0520 and an hand breadth H2948; even the bottom H2436 [shall be] a cubit H0520, and the breadth H7341 a cubit H0520, and the border H1366 thereof by the edge H8193 thereof round about H5439 [shall be] a H0259 span H2239: and this [shall be] the higher place H1354 of the altar H4196.
043:014 And from the bottom H2436 [upon] the ground H0776 [even] to the lower H8481 settle H5835 [shall be] two H8147 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 one H0259 cubit H0520; and from the lesser H6996 settle H5835 [even] to the greater H1419 settle H5835 [shall be] four H0702 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 [one] cubit H0520.
043:015 So the altar H0741 H2025 [shall be] four H0702 cubits H0520; and from the altar H0741 and upward H4605 [shall be] four H0702 horns H7161.
043:016 And the altar H0741 [shall be] twelve H8147 H6240 [cubits] long H0753, twelve H8147 H6240 broad H7341, square H7251 (8803) in the four H0702 squares H7253 thereof.
043:017 And the settle H5835 [shall be] fourteen H0702 H6240 [cubits] long H0753 and fourteen H0702 H6240 broad H7341 in the four H0702 squares H7253 thereof; and the border H1366 about H5439 it [shall be] half H2677 a cubit H0520; and the bottom H2436 thereof [shall be] a cubit H0520 about H5439; and his stairs H4609 shall look H6437 (8800) toward the east H6921.
043:018 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; These [are] the ordinances H2708 of the altar H4196 in the day H3117 when they shall make H6213 (8736) it, to offer H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930 thereon, and to sprinkle H2236 (8800) blood H1818 thereon.
043:019 And thou shalt give H5414 (8804) to the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 that be of the seed H2233 of Zadok H6659, which approach H7138 unto me, to minister H8334 (8763) unto me, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 for a sin offering H2403.
043:020 And thou shalt take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 thereof, and put H5414 (8804) [it] on the four H0702 horns H7161 of it, and on the four H0702 corners H6438 of the settle H5835, and upon the border H1366 round about H5439: thus shalt thou cleanse H2398 (8765) and purge H3722 (8765) it.
043:021 Thou shalt take H3947 (8804) the bullock H6499 also of the sin offering H2403, and he shall burn H8313 (8804) it in the appointed place H4662 of the house H1004, without H2351 the sanctuary H4720.
043:022 And on the second H8145 day H3117 thou shalt offer H7126 (8686) a kid H8163 of the goats H5795 without blemish H8549 for a sin offering H2403; and they shall cleanse H2398 (8765) the altar H4196, as they did cleanse H2398 (8765) [it] with the bullock H6499.
043:023 When thou hast made an end H3615 (8763) of cleansing H2398 (8763) [it], thou shalt offer H7126 (8686) a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 without blemish H8549, and a ram H0352 out of the flock H6629 without blemish H8549.
043:024 And thou shalt offer H7126 (8689) them before H6440 the LORD H3068, and the priests H3548 shall cast H7993 (8689) salt H4417 upon them, and they shall offer them up H5927 (8689) [for] a burnt offering H5930 unto the LORD H3068.
043:025 Seven H7651 days H3117 shalt thou prepare H6213 (8799) every day H3117 a goat H8163 [for] a sin offering H2403: they shall also prepare H6213 (8799) a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499, and a ram H0352 out of the flock H6629, without blemish H8549.
043:026 Seven H7651 days H3117 shall they purge H3722 (8762) the altar H4196 and purify H2891 (8765) it; and they shall consecrate themselves H4390 (8765) H3027.
043:027 And when these days H3117 are expired H3615 (8762), it shall be, [that] upon the eighth H8066 day H3117, and [so] forward H1973, the priests H3548 shall make H6213 (8799) your burnt offerings H5930 upon the altar H4196, and your peace offerings H8002; and I will accept H7521 (8804) you, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
044:001 ¶ Then he brought me back H7725 (8686) the way H1870 of the gate H8179 of the outward H2435 sanctuary H4720 which looketh H6437 (8802) toward the east H6921; and it [was] shut H5462 (8803).
044:002 Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto me; This gate H8179 shall be shut H5462 (8803), it shall not be opened H6605 (8735), and no man H0376 shall enter H0935 (8799) in by it; because the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, hath entered H0935 (8804) in by it, therefore it shall be shut H5462 (8803).
044:003 [It is] for the prince H5387; the prince H5387, he shall sit H3427 (8799) in it to eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899 before H6440 the LORD H3068; he shall enter H0935 (8799) by the way H1870 of the porch H0197 of [that] gate H8179, and shall go out H3318 (8799) by the way H1870 of the same.
044:004 Then brought H0935 (8686) he me the way H1870 of the north H6828 gate H8179 before H6440 the house H1004: and I looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 filled H4390 (8804) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and I fell H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440.
044:005 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, mark H7760 (8798) well H3820, and behold H7200 (8798) with thine eyes H5869, and hear H8085 (8798) with thine ears H0241 all that I say H1696 (8764) unto thee concerning all the ordinances H2708 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and all the laws H8451 thereof; and mark H7760 (8804) well H3820 the entering in H3996 of the house H1004, with every going forth H4161 of the sanctuary H4720.
044:006 And thou shalt say H0559 (8804) to the rebellious H4805, [even] to the house H1004 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; O ye house H1004 of Israel H3478, let it suffice H7227 you of all your abominations H8441,
044:007 In that ye have brought H0935 (8687) [into my sanctuary] strangers H1121 H5236, uncircumcised H6189 in heart H3820, and uncircumcised H6189 in flesh H1320, to be in my sanctuary H4720, to pollute H2490 (8763) it, [even] my house H1004, when ye offer H7126 (8687) my bread H3899, the fat H2459 and the blood H1818, and they have broken H6565 (8686) my covenant H1285 because H0413 of all your abominations H8441.
044:008 And ye have not kept H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of mine holy things H6944: but ye have set H7760 (8799) keepers H8104 (8802) of my charge H4931 in my sanctuary H4720 for yourselves.
044:009 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; No stranger H1121 H5236, uncircumcised H6189 in heart H3820, nor uncircumcised H6189 in flesh H1320, shall enter H0935 (8799) into my sanctuary H4720, of any stranger that [is] among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
044:010 And the Levites H3881 that are gone away far H7368 (8804) from me, when Israel H3478 went astray H8582 (8800), which went astray away H8582 (8804) from me after H0310 their idols H1544; they shall even bear H5375 (8804) their iniquity H5771.
044:011 Yet they shall be ministers H8334 (8764) in my sanctuary H4720, [having] charge H6486 at the gates H8179 of the house H1004, and ministering H8334 (8764) to the house H1004: they shall slay H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930 and the sacrifice H2077 for the people H5971, and they shall stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 them to minister H8334 (8763) unto them.
044:012 Because they ministered H8334 (8762) unto them before H6440 their idols H1544, and caused the house H1004 of Israel H3478 to fall H4383 into iniquity H5771; therefore have I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 against them, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, and they shall bear H5375 (8804) their iniquity H5771.
044:013 And they shall not come near H5066 (8799) unto me, to do the office of a priest H3547 (8763) unto me, nor to come near H5066 (8800) to any of my holy things H6944, in the most holy H6944 [place]: but they shall bear H5375 (8804) their shame H3639, and their abominations H8441 which they have committed H6213 (8804).
044:014 But I will make H5414 (8804) them keepers H8104 (8802) of the charge H4931 of the house H1004, for all the service H5656 thereof, and for all that shall be done H6213 (8735) therein.
044:015 But the priests H3548 the Levites H3881, the sons H1121 of Zadok H6659, that kept H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of my sanctuary H4720 when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went astray H8582 (8800) from me, they shall come near H7126 (8799) to me to minister H8334 (8763) unto me, and they shall stand H5975 (8804) before H6440 me to offer H7126 (8687) unto me the fat H2459 and the blood H1818, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069:
044:016 They shall enter H0935 (8799) into my sanctuary H4720, and they shall come near H7126 (8799) to my table H7979, to minister H8334 (8763) unto me, and they shall keep H8104 (8804) my charge H4931.
044:017 And it shall come to pass, [that] when they enter H0935 (8800) in at the gates H8179 of the inner H6442 court H2691, they shall be clothed H3847 (8799) with linen H6593 garments H0899; and no wool H6785 shall come H5927 (8799) upon them, whiles they minister H8334 (8763) in the gates H8179 of the inner H6442 court H2691, and within H1004.
044:018 They shall have linen H6593 bonnets H6287 upon their heads H7218, and shall have linen H6593 breeches H4370 upon their loins H4975; they shall not gird H2296 (8799) [themselves] with any thing that causeth sweat H3154.
044:019 And when they go forth H3318 (8800) into the utter H2435 court H2691, [even] into the utter H2435 court H2691 to the people H5971, they shall put off H6584 (8799) their garments H0899 wherein they ministered H8334 (8764), and lay H3240 (8689) them in the holy H6944 chambers H3957, and they shall put H3847 (8804) on other H0312 garments H0899; and they shall not sanctify H6942 (8762) the people H5971 with their garments H0899.
044:020 Neither shall they shave H1548 (8762) their heads H7218, nor suffer their locks H6545 to grow long H7971 (8762); they shall only H3697 (8800) poll H3697 (8799) their heads H7218.
044:021 Neither shall any priest H3548 drink H8354 (8799) wine H3196, when they enter H0935 (8800) into the inner H6442 court H2691.
044:022 Neither shall they take H3947 (8799) for their wives H0802 a widow H0490, nor her that is put away H1644 (8803): but they shall take H3947 (8799) maidens H1330 of the seed H2233 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, or a widow H0490 that had a priest H3548 before.
044:023 And they shall teach H3384 (8686) my people H5971 [the difference] between the holy H6944 and profane H2455, and cause them to discern H3045 (8686) between the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889.
044:024 And in controversy H7379 they shall stand H5975 (8799) in judgment H8199 (8800); [and] they shall judge H8199 (8799) it according to my judgments H4941: and they shall keep H8104 (8799) my laws H8451 and my statutes H2708 in all mine assemblies H4150; and they shall hallow H6942 (8762) my sabbaths H7676.
044:025 And they shall come H0935 (8799) at no dead H4191 (8801) person H0120 to defile H2930 (8800) themselves: but for father H0001, or for mother H0517, or for son H1121, or for daughter H1323, for brother H0251, or for sister H0269 that hath had no husband H0376, they may defile H2930 (8691) themselves.
044:026 And after H0310 he is cleansed H2893, they shall reckon H5608 (8799) unto him seven H7651 days H3117.
044:027 And in the day H3117 that he goeth H0935 (8800) into the sanctuary H6944, unto the inner H6442 court H2691, to minister H8334 (8763) in the sanctuary H6944, he shall offer H7126 (8686) his sin offering H2403, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance H5159: I [am] their inheritance H5159: and ye shall give H5414 (8799) them no possession H0272 in Israel H3478: I [am] their possession H0272.
044:029 They shall eat H0398 (8799) the meat offering H4503, and the sin offering H2403, and the trespass offering H0817; and every dedicated thing H2764 in Israel H3478 shall be theirs.
044:030 And the first H7225 of all the firstfruits H1061 of all [things], and every oblation H8641 of all, of every [sort] of your oblations H8641, shall be the priest’s H3548: ye shall also give H5414 (8799) unto the priest H3548 the first H7225 of your dough H6182, that he may cause the blessing H1293 to rest H5117 (8687) in thine house H1004.
044:031 The priests H3548 shall not eat H0398 (8799) of any thing that is dead of itself H5038, or torn H2966, whether it be fowl H5775 or beast H0929.
045:001 ¶ Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot H5307 (8687) the land H0776 for inheritance H5159, ye shall offer H7311 (8686) an oblation H8641 unto the LORD H3068, an holy portion H6944 of the land H0776: the length H0753 [shall be] the length H0753 of five H2568 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 [reeds], and the breadth H7341 [shall be] ten H6235 thousand H0505. This [shall be] holy H6944 in all the borders H1366 thereof round about H5439.
045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary H6944 five H2568 hundred H3967 [in length], with five H2568 hundred H3967 [in breadth], square H7251 (8794) round about H5439; and fifty H2572 cubits H0520 round about H5439 for the suburbs H4054 thereof.
045:003 And of this measure H4060 shalt thou measure H4058 (8799) the length H0753 of five H2568 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505, and the breadth H7341 of ten H6235 thousand H0505: and in it shall be the sanctuary H4720 [and] the most H6944 holy H6944 [place].
045:004 The holy H6944 [portion] of the land H0776 shall be for the priests H3548 the ministers H8334 (8764) of the sanctuary H4720, which shall come near H7131 to minister H8334 (8763) unto the LORD H3068: and it shall be a place H4725 for their houses H1004, and an holy place H4720 for the sanctuary H4720.
045:005 And the five H2568 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 of length H0753, and the ten H6235 thousand H0505 of breadth H7341, shall also the Levites H3881, the ministers H8334 (8764) of the house H1004, have for themselves, for a possession H0272 for twenty H6242 chambers H3957.
045:006 And ye shall appoint H5414 (8799) the possession H0272 of the city H5892 five H2568 thousand H0505 broad H7341, and five H2568 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 long H0753, over against H5980 the oblation H8641 of the holy H6944 [portion]: it shall be for the whole house H1004 of Israel H3478.
045:007 And a [portion shall be] for the prince H5387 on the one side and on the other side of the oblation H8641 of the holy H6944 [portion], and of the possession H0272 of the city H5892, before H6440 the oblation H8641 of the holy H6944 [portion], and before H6440 the possession H0272 of the city H5892, from the west H3220 side H6285 westward H3220, and from the east H6924 side H6285 eastward H6921: and the length H0753 [shall be] over against H5980 one H0259 of the portions H2506, from the west H3220 border H1366 unto the east H6921 border H1366.
045:008 In the land H0776 shall be his possession H0272 in Israel H3478: and my princes H5387 shall no more oppress H3238 (8686) my people H5971; and [the rest of] the land H0776 shall they give H5414 (8799) to the house H1004 of Israel H3478 according to their tribes H7626.
045:009 Thus saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Let it suffice H7227 you, O princes H5387 of Israel H3478: remove H5493 (8685) violence H2555 and spoil H7701, and execute H6213 (8798) judgment H4941 and justice H6666, take away H7311 (8685) your exactions H1646 from my people H5971, saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
045:010 Ye shall have just H6664 balances H3976, and a just H6664 ephah H0374, and a just H6664 bath H1324.
045:011 The ephah H0374 and the bath H1324 shall be of one H0259 measure H8506, that the bath H1324 may contain H5375 (8800) the tenth part H4643 of an homer H2563, and the ephah H0374 the tenth part H6224 of an homer H2563: the measure H4971 thereof shall be after the homer H2563.
045:012 And the shekel H8255 [shall be] twenty H6242 gerahs H1626: twenty H6242 shekels H8255, five H2568 and twenty H6242 shekels H8255, fifteen H2568 H6235 shekels H8255, shall be your maneh H4488.
045:013 This [is] the oblation H8641 that ye shall offer H7311 (8686); the sixth part H8345 of an ephah H0374 of an homer H2563 of wheat H2406, and ye shall give the sixth part H8341 (8765) of an ephah H0374 of an homer H2563 of barley H8184:
045:014 Concerning the ordinance H2706 of oil H8081, the bath H1324 of oil H8081, [ye shall offer] the tenth part H4643 of a bath H1324 out of the cor H3734, [which is] an homer H2563 of ten H6235 baths H1324; for ten H6235 baths H1324 [are] an homer H2563:
045:015 And one H0259 lamb H7716 out of the flock H6629, out of two hundred H3967, out of the fat pastures H4945 of Israel H3478; for a meat offering H4503, and for a burnt offering H5930, and for peace offerings H8002, to make reconciliation H3722 (8763) for them, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
045:016 All the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall give this oblation H8641 for the prince H5387 in Israel H3478.
045:017 And it shall be the prince’s part H5387 [to give] burnt offerings H5930, and meat offerings H4503, and drink offerings H5262, in the feasts H2282, and in the new moons H2320, and in the sabbaths H7676, in all solemnities H4150 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478: he shall prepare H6213 (8799) the sin offering H2403, and the meat offering H4503, and the burnt offering H5930, and the peace offerings H8002, to make reconciliation H3722 (8763) for the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
045:018 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; In the first H7223 [month], in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, thou shalt take H3947 (8799) a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 without blemish H8549, and cleanse H2398 (8765) the sanctuary H4720:
045:019 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 of the sin offering H2403, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the posts H4201 of the house H1004, and upon the four H0702 corners H6438 of the settle H5835 of the altar H4196, and upon the posts H4201 of the gate H8179 of the inner H6442 court H2691.
045:020 And so thou shalt do H6213 (8799) the seventh H7651 [day] of the month H2320 for every one H0376 that erreth H7686 (8802), and for [him that is] simple H6612: so shall ye reconcile H3722 (8765) the house H1004.
045:021 In the first H7223 [month], in the fourteenth H0702 H6240 day H3117 of the month H2320, ye shall have the passover H6453, a feast H2282 of seven H7620 days H3117; unleavened bread H4682 shall be eaten H0398 (8735).
045:022 And upon that day H3117 shall the prince H5387 prepare H6213 (8804) for himself and for all the people H5971 of the land H0776 a bullock H6499 [for] a sin offering H2403.
045:023 And seven H7651 days H3117 of the feast H2282 he shall prepare H6213 (8799) a burnt offering H5930 to the LORD H3068, seven H7651 bullocks H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352 without blemish H8549 daily H3117 the seven H7651 days H3117; and a kid H8163 of the goats H5795 daily H3117 [for] a sin offering H2403.
045:024 And he shall prepare H6213 (8799) a meat offering H4503 of an ephah H0374 for a bullock H6499, and an ephah H0374 for a ram H0352, and an hin H1969 of oil H8081 for an ephah H0374.
045:025 In the seventh H7651 [month], in the fifteenth H2568 H6240 day H3117 of the month H2320, shall he do H6213 (8799) the like in the feast H2282 of the seven H7637 days H3117, according to the sin offering H2403, according to the burnt offering H5930, and according to the meat offering H4503, and according to the oil H8081.
046:001 ¶ Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; The gate H8179 of the inner H6442 court H2691 that looketh H6437 (8802) toward the east H6921 shall be shut H5462 (8803) the six H8337 working H4639 days H3117; but on the sabbath H7676 H3117 it shall be opened H6605 (8735), and in the day H3117 of the new moon H2320 it shall be opened H6605 (8735).
046:002 And the prince H5387 shall enter H0935 (8804) by the way H1870 of the porch H0197 of [that] gate H8179 without H2351, and shall stand H5975 (8804) by the post H4201 of the gate H8179, and the priests H3548 shall prepare H6213 (8804) his burnt offering H5930 and his peace offerings H8002, and he shall worship H7812 (8694) at the threshold H4670 of the gate H8179: then he shall go forth H3318 (8804); but the gate H8179 shall not be shut H5462 (8735) until the evening H6153.
046:003 Likewise the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall worship H7812 (8694) at the door H6607 of this gate H8179 before H6440 the LORD H3068 in the sabbaths H7676 and in the new moons H2320.
046:004 And the burnt offering H5930 that the prince H5387 shall offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 in the sabbath H7676 day H3117 [shall be] six H8337 lambs H3532 without blemish H8549, and a ram H0352 without blemish H8549.
046:005 And the meat offering H4503 [shall be] an ephah H0374 for a ram H0352, and the meat offering H4503 for the lambs H3532 as he shall be able H3027 to give H4991, and an hin H1969 of oil H8081 to an ephah H0374.
046:006 And in the day H3117 of the new moon H2320 [it shall be] a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 without blemish H8549, and six H8337 lambs H3532, and a ram H0352: they shall be without blemish H8549.
046:007 And he shall prepare H6213 (8799) a meat offering H4503, an ephah H0374 for a bullock H6499, and an ephah H0374 for a ram H0352, and for the lambs H3532 according as his hand H3027 shall attain H5381 (8686) unto, and an hin H1969 of oil H8081 to an ephah H0374.
046:008 And when the prince H5387 shall enter H0935 (8800), he shall go H0935 (8799) in by the way H1870 of the porch H0197 of [that] gate H8179, and he shall go forth H3318 (8799) by the way H1870 thereof.
046:009 But when the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall come H0935 (8800) before H6440 the LORD H3068 in the solemn feasts H4150, he that entereth H0935 (8802) in by the way H1870 of the north H6828 gate H8179 to worship H7812 (8692) shall go out H3318 (8799) by the way H1870 of the south H5045 gate H8179; and he that entereth H0935 (8802) by the way H1870 of the south H5045 gate H8179 shall go forth H3318 (8799) by the way H1870 of the north H6828 gate H8179: he shall not return H7725 (8799) by the way H1870 of the gate H8179 whereby he came in H0935 (8804), but shall go forth H3318 (8799) over against H5226 it.
046:010 And the prince H5387 in the midst H8432 of them, when they go in H0935 (8800), shall go in H0935 (8799); and when they go forth H3318 (8800), shall go forth H3318 (8799).
046:011 And in the feasts H2282 and in the solemnities H4150 the meat offering H4503 shall be an ephah H0374 to a bullock H6499, and an ephah H0374 to a ram H0352, and to the lambs H3532 as he is able H3027 to give H4991, and an hin H1969 of oil H8081 to an ephah H0374.
046:012 Now when the prince H5387 shall prepare H6213 (8799) a voluntary H5071 burnt offering H5930 or peace offerings H8002 voluntarily H5071 unto the LORD H3068, [one] shall then open H6605 (8804) him the gate H8179 that looketh H6437 (8802) toward the east H6921, and he shall prepare H6213 (8804) his burnt offering H5930 and his peace offerings H8002, as he did H6213 (8799) on the sabbath H7676 day H3117: then he shall go forth H3318 (8804); and after H0310 his going forth H3318 (8800) [one] shall shut H5462 (8804) the gate H8179.
046:013 Thou shalt daily H3117 prepare H6213 (8799) a burnt offering H5930 unto the LORD H3068 [of] a lamb H3532 of the first H1121 year H8141 without blemish H8549: thou shalt prepare H6213 (8799) it every H1242 morning H1242.
046:014 And thou shalt prepare H6213 (8799) a meat offering H4503 for it every morning H1242, the sixth part H8345 of an ephah H0374, and the third part H7992 of an hin H1969 of oil H8081, to temper with H7450 (8800) the fine flour H5560; a meat offering H4503 continually H8548 by a perpetual H5769 ordinance H2708 unto the LORD H3068.
046:015 Thus shall they prepare H6213 (8799) (8675) H6213 (8804) the lamb H3532, and the meat offering H4503, and the oil H8081, every morning H1242 [for] a continual H8548 burnt offering H5930.
046:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; If the prince H5387 give H5414 (8799) a gift H4979 unto any H0376 of his sons H1121, the inheritance H5159 thereof shall be his sons H1121 ’; it [shall be] their possession H0272 by inheritance H5159.
046:017 But if he give H5414 (8799) a gift H4979 of his inheritance H5159 to one H0259 of his servants H5650, then it shall be his to the year H8141 of liberty H1865; after it shall return H7725 (8804) to the prince H5387: but his inheritance H5159 shall be his sons H1121 ’ for them.
046:018 Moreover the prince H5387 shall not take H3947 (8799) of the people’s H5971 inheritance H5159 by oppression H3238 (8687), to thrust H3238 (8687) them out of their possession H0272; [but] he shall give his sons H1121 inheritance H5157 (8686) out of his own possession H0272: that my people H5971 be not scattered H6327 (8799) every man H0376 from his possession H0272.
046:019 After he brought H0935 (8686) me through the entry H3996, which [was] at the side H3802 of the gate H8179, into the holy H6944 chambers H3957 of the priests H3548, which looked H6437 (8802) toward the north H6828: and, behold, there [was] a place H4725 on the two sides H3411 westward H3220.
046:020 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, This [is] the place H4725 where the priests H3548 shall boil H1310 (8762) the trespass offering H0817 and the sin offering H2403, where they shall bake H0644 (8799) the meat offering H4503; that they bear H3318 (8687) [them] not out into the utter H2435 court H2691, to sanctify H6942 (8763) the people H5971.
046:021 Then he brought me forth H3318 (8686) into the utter H2435 court H2691, and caused me to pass by H5674 (8686) the four H0702 corners H4740 of the court H2691; and, behold, in every H4740 corner H4740 of the court H2691 H2691 [there was] a court H2691.
046:022 In the four H0702 corners H4740 of the court H2691 [there were] courts H2691 joined H7000 (8803) of forty H0705 [cubits] long H0753 and thirty H7970 broad H7341: these four H0702 corners H7106 (8716) [were] of one H0259 measure H4060.
046:023 And [there was] a row H2905 [of building] round about H5439 in them, round about H5439 them four H0702, and [it was] made H6213 (8803) with boiling places H4018 under the rows H2918 round about H5439.
046:024 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, These [are] the places H1004 of them that boil H1310 (8764), where the ministers H8334 (8764) of the house H1004 shall boil H1310 (8762) the sacrifice H2077 of the people H5971.
047:001 ¶ Afterward he brought me again H7725 (8686) unto the door H6607 of the house H1004; and, behold, waters H4325 issued out H3318 (8802) from under the threshold H4670 of the house H1004 eastward H6921: for the forefront H6440 of the house H1004 [stood toward] the east H6921, and the waters H4325 came down H3381 (8802) from under from the right H3233 side H3802 of the house H1004, at the south H5045 [side] of the altar H4196.
047:002 Then brought he me out H3318 (8686) of the way H1870 of the gate H8179 northward H6828, and led me about H5437 (8686) the way H1870 without unto the utter H2351 gate H8179 by the way H1870 that looketh H6437 (8802) eastward H6921; and, behold, there ran out H6379 (8764) waters H4325 on the right H3233 side H3802.
047:003 And when the man H0376 that had the line H6957 in his hand H3027 went forth H3318 (8800) eastward H6921, he measured H4058 (8799) a thousand H0505 cubits H0520, and he brought me through H5674 (8686) the waters H4325; the waters H4325 [were] to the ankles H0657.
047:004 Again he measured H4058 (8799) a thousand H0505, and brought me through H5674 (8686) the waters H4325; the waters H4325 [were] to the knees H1290. Again he measured H4058 (8799) a thousand H0505, and brought me through H5674 (8686); the waters H4325 [were] to the loins H4975.
047:005 Afterward he measured H4058 (8799) a thousand H0505; [and it was] a river H5158 that I could H3201 (8799) not pass over H5674 (8800): for the waters H4325 were risen H1342 (8804), waters H4325 to swim in H7813, a river H5158 that could not be passed over H5674 (8735).
047:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Son H1121 of man H0120, hast thou seen H7200 (8804) [this]? Then he brought H3212 (8686) me, and caused me to return H7725 (8686) to the brink H8193 of the river H5158.
047:007 Now when I had returned H7725 (8800), behold, at the bank H8193 of the river H5158 [were] very H3966 many H7227 trees H6086 on the one side and on the other.
047:008 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, These waters H4325 issue out H3318 (8802) toward the east H6930 country H1552, and go down H3381 (8804) into the desert H6160, and go H0935 (8804) into the sea H3220: [which being] brought forth H3318 (8716) into the sea H3220, the waters H4325 shall be healed H7495 (8738).
047:009 And it shall come to pass, [that] every thing H5315 that liveth H2416, which moveth H8317 (8799), whithersoever the rivers H5158 shall come H0935 (8799), shall live H2421 (8799): and there shall be a very H3966 great H7227 multitude of fish H1710, because these waters H4325 shall come H0935 (8804) thither: for they shall be healed H7495 (8735); and every thing shall live H2425 (8804) whither the river H5158 cometh H0935 (8799).
047:010 And it shall come to pass, [that] the fishers H1728 shall stand H5975 (8804) (8675) H5975 (8799) upon it from Engedi H5872 even unto Eneglaim H5882; they shall be a [place] to spread forth H4894 nets H2764; their fish H1710 shall be according to their kinds H4327, as the fish H1710 of the great H1419 sea H3220, exceeding H3966 many H7227.
047:011 But the miry places H1207 thereof and the marishes H1360 thereof shall not be healed H7495 (8735); they shall be given H5414 (8738) to salt H4417.
047:012 And by the river H5158 upon the bank H8193 thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow H5927 (8799) all trees H6086 for meat H3978, whose leaf H5929 shall not fade H5034 (8799), neither shall the fruit H6529 thereof be consumed H8552 (8799): it shall bring forth new fruit H1069 (8762) according to his months H2320, because their waters H4325 they issued out H3318 (8802) of the sanctuary H4720: and the fruit H6529 thereof shall be for meat H3978, and the leaf H5929 thereof for medicine H8644.
047:013 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; This H1454 [shall be] the border H1366, whereby ye shall inherit H5157 (8691) the land H0776 according to the twelve H8147 H6240 tribes H7626 of Israel H3478: Joseph H3130 [shall have two] portions H2256.
047:014 And ye shall inherit H5157 (8804) it, one H0376 as well as another H0251: [concerning] the which I lifted up H5375 (8804) mine hand H3027 to give H5414 (8800) it unto your fathers H0001: and this land H0776 shall fall H5307 (8804) unto you for inheritance H5159.
047:015 And this [shall be] the border H1366 of the land H0776 toward the north H6828 side H6285, from the great H1419 sea H3220, the way H1870 of Hethlon H2855, as men go H0935 (8800) to Zedad H6657;
047:016 Hamath H2574, Berothah H1268, Sibraim H5453, which [is] between the border H1366 of Damascus H1834 and the border H1366 of Hamath H2574; Hazarhatticon H2694, which [is] by the coast H1366 of Hauran H2362.
047:017 And the border H1366 from the sea H3220 shall be Hazarenan H2703, the border H1366 of Damascus H1834, and the north H6828 northward H6828, and the border H1366 of Hamath H2574. And [this is] the north H6828 side H6285.
047:018 And the east H6921 side H6285 ye shall measure H4058 (8799) from H0996 Hauran H2362, and from H0996 Damascus H1834, and from H0996 Gilead H1568, and from H0996 the land H0776 of Israel H3478 [by] Jordan H3383, from the border H1366 unto the east H6931 sea H3220. And [this is] the east H6921 side H6285.
047:019 And the south H5045 side H6285 southward H8486, from Tamar H8559 [even] to the waters H4325 of strife H4808 (8677) H4809 [in] Kadesh H6946, the river H5158 to the great H1419 sea H3220. And [this is] the south H8486 side H6285 southward H5045.
