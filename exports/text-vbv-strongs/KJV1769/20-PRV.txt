001:001 ¶ The proverbs H4912 of Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732, king H4428 of Israel H3478;
001:002 To know H3045 (8800) wisdom H2451 and instruction H4148; to perceive H0995 (8687) the words H0561 of understanding H0998;
001:003 To receive H3947 (8800) the instruction H4148 of wisdom H7919 (8687), justice H6664, and judgment H4941, and equity H4339;
001:004 To give H5414 (8800) subtilty H6195 to the simple H6612, to the young man H5288 knowledge H1847 and discretion H4209.
001:005 A wise H2450 [man] will hear H8085 (8799), and will increase H3254 (8686) learning H3948; and a man of understanding H0995 (8737) shall attain H7069 (8799) unto wise counsels H8458:
001:006 To understand H0995 (8687) a proverb H4912, and the interpretation H4426; the words H1697 of the wise H2450, and their dark sayings H2420.
001:007 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] the beginning H7225 of knowledge H1847: [but] fools H0191 despise H0936 (8804) wisdom H2451 and instruction H4148.
001:008 My son H1121, hear H8085 (8798) the instruction H4148 of thy father H0001, and forsake H5203 (8799) not the law H8451 of thy mother H0517:
001:009 For they [shall be] an ornament H3880 of grace H2580 unto thy head H7218, and chains H6060 about thy neck H1621.
001:010 My son H1121, if sinners H2400 entice H6601 (8762) thee, consent H0014 (8799) thou not.
001:011 If they say H0559 (8799), Come H3212 (8798) with us, let us lay wait H0693 (8799) for blood H1818, let us lurk H6845 (8799) privily for the innocent H5355 without cause H2600:
001:012 Let us swallow them up H1104 (8799) alive H2416 as the grave H7585; and whole H8549, as those that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953:
001:013 We shall find H4672 (8799) all precious H3368 substance H1952, we shall fill H4390 (8762) our houses H1004 with spoil H7998:
001:014 Cast H5307 (8686) in thy lot H1486 among H8432 us; let us all have one H0259 purse H3599:
001:015 My son H1121, walk H3212 (8799) not thou in the way H1870 with them; refrain H4513 (8798) thy foot H7272 from their path H5410:
001:016 For their feet H7272 run H7323 (8799) to evil H7451, and make haste H4116 (8762) to shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818.
001:017 Surely in vain H2600 the net H7568 is spread H2219 (8794) in the sight H5869 of any bird H1167 H3671.
001:018 And they lay wait H0693 (8799) for their [own] blood H1818; they lurk privily H6845 (8799) for their [own] lives H5315.
001:019 So [are] the ways H0734 of every one that is greedy H1214 (8802) of gain H1215; [which] taketh away H3947 (8799) the life H5315 of the owners H1167 thereof.
001:020 Wisdom H2454 crieth H7442 (8799) without H2351; she uttereth H5414 (8799) her voice H6963 in the streets H7339:
001:021 She crieth H7121 (8799) in the chief place H7218 of concourse H1993 (8802), in the openings H6607 of the gates H8179: in the city H5892 she uttereth H0559 (8799) her words H0561, [saying],
001:022 How long, ye simple ones H6612, will ye love H0157 (8799) simplicity H6612? and the scorners H3887 (8801) delight H2530 (8804) in their scorning H3944, and fools H3684 hate H8130 (8799) knowledge H1847?
001:023 Turn H7725 (8799) you at my reproof H8433: behold, I will pour out H5042 (8686) my spirit H7307 unto you, I will make known H3045 (8686) my words H1697 unto you.
001:024 Because I have called H7121 (8804), and ye refused H3985 (8762); I have stretched out H5186 (8804) my hand H3027, and no man regarded H7181 (8688);
001:025 But ye have set at nought H6544 (8799) all my counsel H6098, and would H0014 (8804) none of my reproof H8433:
001:026 I also will laugh H7832 (8799) at your calamity H0343; I will mock H3932 (8799) when your fear H6343 cometh H0935 (8800);
001:027 When your fear H6343 cometh H0935 (8800) as desolation H7722 (8675) H7584, and your destruction H0343 cometh H0857 (8799) as a whirlwind H5492; when distress H6869 and anguish H6695 cometh H0935 (8800) upon you.
001:028 Then shall they call H7121 (8799) upon me, but I will not answer H6030 (8799); they shall seek me early H7836 (8762), but they shall not find H4672 (8799) me:
001:029 For that they hated H8130 (8804) knowledge H1847, and did not choose H0977 (8804) the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068:
001:030 They would H0014 (8804) none of my counsel H6098: they despised H5006 (8804) all my reproof H8433.
001:031 Therefore shall they eat H0398 (8799) of the fruit H6529 of their own way H1870, and be filled H7646 (8799) with their own devices H4156.
001:032 For the turning away H4878 of the simple H6612 shall slay H2026 (8799) them, and the prosperity H7962 of fools H3684 shall destroy H0006 (8762) them.
001:033 But whoso hearkeneth H8085 (8802) unto me shall dwell H7931 (8799) safely H0983, and shall be quiet H7599 (8768) from fear H6343 of evil H7451.
002:001 ¶ My son H1121, if thou wilt receive H3947 (8799) my words H0561, and hide H6845 (8799) my commandments H4687 with thee;
002:002 So that thou incline H7181 (8687) thine ear H0241 unto wisdom H2451, [and] apply H5186 (8686) thine heart H3820 to understanding H8394;
002:003 Yea, if thou criest H7121 (8799) after knowledge H0998, [and] liftest up H5414 (8799) thy voice H6963 for understanding H8394;
002:004 If thou seekest H1245 (8762) her as silver H3701, and searchest H2664 (8799) for her as [for] hid treasures H4301;
002:005 Then shalt thou understand H0995 (8799) the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068, and find H4672 (8799) the knowledge H1847 of God H0430.
002:006 For the LORD H3068 giveth H5414 (8799) wisdom H2451: out of his mouth H6310 [cometh] knowledge H1847 and understanding H8394.
002:007 He layeth up H6845 (8799) (8675) H6845 (8804) sound wisdom H8454 for the righteous H3477: [he is] a buckler H4043 to them that walk H1980 (8802) uprightly H8537.
002:008 He keepeth H5341 (8800) the paths H0734 of judgment H4941, and preserveth H8104 (8799) the way H1870 of his saints H2623.
002:009 Then shalt thou understand H0995 (8799) righteousness H6664, and judgment H4941, and equity H4339; [yea], every good H2896 path H4570.
002:010 When wisdom H2451 entereth H0935 (8799) into thine heart H3820, and knowledge H1847 is pleasant H5276 (8799) unto thy soul H5315;
002:011 Discretion H4209 shall preserve H8104 (8799) thee, understanding H8394 shall keep H5341 (8799) thee:
002:012 To deliver H5337 (8687) thee from the way H1870 of the evil H7451 [man], from the man H0376 that speaketh H1696 (8764) froward things H8419;
002:013 Who leave H5800 (8802) the paths H0734 of uprightness H3476, to walk H3212 (8800) in the ways H1870 of darkness H2822;
002:014 Who rejoice H8056 to do H6213 (8800) evil H7451, [and] delight H1523 (8799) in the frowardness H8419 of the wicked H7451;
002:015 Whose ways H0734 [are] crooked H6141, and [they] froward H3868 (8737) in their paths H4570:
002:016 To deliver H5337 (8687) thee from the strange H2114 (8801) woman H0802, [even] from the stranger H5237 [which] flattereth H2505 (8689) with her words H0561;
002:017 Which forsaketh H5800 (8802) the guide H0441 of her youth H5271, and forgetteth H7911 (8804) the covenant H1285 of her God H0430.
002:018 For her house H1004 inclineth H7743 (8804) unto death H4194, and her paths H4570 unto the dead H7496.
002:019 None that go H0935 (8802) unto her return again H7725 (8799), neither take they hold H5381 (8686) of the paths H0734 of life H2416.
002:020 That thou mayest walk H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of good H2896 [men], and keep H8104 (8799) the paths H0734 of the righteous H6662.
002:021 For the upright H3477 shall dwell H7931 (8799) in the land H0776, and the perfect H8549 shall remain H3498 (8735) in it.
002:022 But the wicked H7563 shall be cut off H3772 (8735) from the earth H0776, and the transgressors H0898 (8802) shall be rooted out H5255 (8799) of it.
003:001 ¶ My son H1121, forget H7911 (8799) not my law H8451; but let thine heart H3820 keep H5341 (8799) my commandments H4687:
003:002 For length H0753 of days H3117, and long H8141 life H2416, and peace H7965, shall they add H3254 (8686) to thee.
003:003 Let not mercy H2617 and truth H0571 forsake H5800 (8799) thee: bind H7194 (8798) them about thy neck H1621; write H3789 (8798) them upon the table H3871 of thine heart H3820:
003:004 So shalt thou find H4672 (8798) favour H2580 and good H2896 understanding H7922 in the sight H5869 of God H0430 and man H0120.
003:005 Trust H0982 (8798) in the LORD H3068 with all thine heart H3820; and lean H8172 (8735) not unto thine own understanding H0998.
003:006 In all thy ways H1870 acknowledge H3045 (8798) him, and he shall direct H3474 (8762) thy paths H0734.
003:007 Be not wise H2450 in thine own eyes H5869: fear H3372 (8798) the LORD H3068, and depart H5493 (8798) from evil H7451.
003:008 It shall be health H7500 to thy navel H8270, and marrow H8250 to thy bones H6106.
003:009 Honour H3513 (8761) the LORD H3068 with thy substance H1952, and with the firstfruits H7225 of all thine increase H8393:
003:010 So shall thy barns H0618 be filled H4390 (8735) with plenty H7647, and thy presses H3342 shall burst out H6555 (8799) with new wine H8492.
003:011 My son H1121, despise H3988 (8799) not the chastening H4148 of the LORD H3068; neither be weary H6973 (8799) of his correction H8433:
003:012 For whom the LORD H3068 loveth H0157 (8799) he correcteth H3198 (8686); even as a father H0001 the son H1121 [in whom] he delighteth H7521 (8799).
003:013 Happy H0835 [is] the man H0120 [that] findeth H4672 (8804) wisdom H2451, and the man H0120 [that] getteth H6329 (8686) understanding H8394.
003:014 For the merchandise H5504 of it [is] better H2896 than the merchandise H5505 of silver H3701, and the gain H8393 thereof than fine gold H2742.
003:015 She [is] more precious H3368 than rubies H6443: and all the things thou canst desire H2656 are not to be compared H7737 (8799) unto her.
003:016 Length H0753 of days H3117 [is] in her right hand H3225; [and] in her left hand H8040 riches H6239 and honour H3519.
003:017 Her ways H1870 [are] ways H1870 of pleasantness H5278, and all her paths H5410 [are] peace H7965.
003:018 She [is] a tree H6086 of life H2416 to them that lay hold H2388 (8688) upon her: and happy H0833 (8794) [is every one] that retaineth H8551 (8802) her.
003:019 The LORD H3068 by wisdom H2451 hath founded H3245 (8804) the earth H0776; by understanding H8394 hath he established H3559 (8790) the heavens H8064.
003:020 By his knowledge H1847 the depths H8415 are broken up H1234 (8738), and the clouds H7834 drop down H7491 (8799) the dew H2919.
003:021 My son H1121, let not them depart H3868 (8799) from thine eyes H5869: keep H5341 (8798) sound wisdom H8454 and discretion H4209:
003:022 So shall they be life H2416 unto thy soul H5315, and grace H2580 to thy neck H1621.
003:023 Then shalt thou walk H3212 (8799) in thy way H1870 safely H0983, and thy foot H7272 shall not stumble H5062 (8799).
003:024 When thou liest down H7901 (8799), thou shalt not be afraid H6342 (8799): yea, thou shalt lie down H7901 (8804), and thy sleep H8142 shall be sweet H6149 (8804).
003:025 Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of sudden H6597 fear H6343, neither of the desolation H7722 of the wicked H7563, when it cometh H0935 (8799).
003:026 For the LORD H3068 shall be thy confidence H3689, and shall keep H8104 (8804) thy foot H7272 from being taken H3921.
003:027 Withhold H4513 (8799) not good H2896 from them to whom it is due H1167, when it is in the power H0410 of thine hand H3027 to do H6213 (8800) [it].
003:028 Say H0559 (8799) not unto thy neighbour H7453, Go H3212 (8798), and come again H7725 (8798), and to morrow H4279 I will give H5414 (8799); when thou hast H3426 it by thee.
003:029 Devise H2790 (8799) not evil H7451 against thy neighbour H7453, seeing he dwelleth H3427 (8802) securely H0983 by thee.
003:030 Strive H7378 (8799) not with a man H0120 without cause H2600, if he have done H1580 (8804) thee no harm H7451.
003:031 Envy H7065 (8762) thou not the oppressor H0376 H2555, and choose H0977 (8799) none of his ways H1870.
003:032 For the froward H3868 (8737) [is] abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but his secret H5475 [is] with the righteous H3477.
003:033 The curse H3994 of the LORD H3068 [is] in the house H1004 of the wicked H7563: but he blesseth H1288 (8762) the habitation H5116 of the just H6662.
003:034 Surely he scorneth H3887 (8686) the scorners H3887 (8801): but he giveth H5414 (8799) grace H2580 unto the lowly H6035 (8675) H6041.
003:035 The wise H2450 shall inherit H5157 (8799) glory H3519: but shame H7036 shall be the promotion H7311 (8688) of fools H3684.
004:001 ¶ Hear H8085 (8798), ye children H1121, the instruction H4148 of a father H0001, and attend H7181 (8685) to know H3045 (8800) understanding H0998.
004:002 For I give H5414 (8804) you good H2896 doctrine H3948, forsake H5800 (8799) ye not my law H8451.
004:003 For I was my father’s H0001 son H1121, tender H7390 and only H3173 [beloved] in the sight H6440 of my mother H0517.
004:004 He taught H3384 (8686) me also, and said H0559 (8799) unto me, Let thine heart H3820 retain H8551 (8799) my words H1697: keep H8104 (8798) my commandments H4687, and live H2421 (8798).
004:005 Get H7069 (8798) wisdom H2451, get H7069 (8798) understanding H0998: forget H7911 (8799) [it] not; neither decline H5186 (8799) from the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
004:006 Forsake H5800 (8799) her not, and she shall preserve H8104 (8799) thee: love H0157 (8798) her, and she shall keep H5341 (8799) thee.
004:007 Wisdom H2451 [is] the principal thing H7225; [therefore] get H7069 (8798) wisdom H2451: and with all thy getting H7075 get understanding H0998.
004:008 Exalt H5549 (8769) her, and she shall promote H7311 (8787) thee: she shall bring thee to honour H3513 (8762), when thou dost embrace H2263 (8762) her.
004:009 She shall give H5414 (8799) to thine head H7218 an ornament H3880 of grace H2580: a crown H5850 of glory H8597 shall she deliver H4042 (8762) to thee.
004:010 Hear H8085 (8798), O my son H1121, and receive H3947 (8798) my sayings H0561; and the years H8141 of thy life H2416 shall be many H7235 (8799).
004:011 I have taught H3384 (8689) thee in the way H1870 of wisdom H2451; I have led H1869 (8689) thee in right H3476 paths H4570.
004:012 When thou goest H3212 (8800), thy steps H6806 shall not be straitened H3334 (8799); and when thou runnest H7323 (8799), thou shalt not stumble H3782 (8735).
004:013 Take fast hold H2388 (8685) of instruction H4148; let [her] not go H7503 (8686): keep H5341 (8798) her; for she [is] thy life H2416.
004:014 Enter H0935 (8799) not into the path H0734 of the wicked H7563, and go H0833 (8762) not in the way H1870 of evil H7451 [men].
004:015 Avoid H6544 (8798) it, pass H5674 (8799) not by it, turn H7847 (8798) from it, and pass away H5674 (8798).
004:016 For they sleep H3462 (8799) not, except they have done mischief H7489 (8686); and their sleep H8142 is taken away H1497 (8738), unless they cause [some] to fall H3782 (8686) (8675) H3782 (8799).
004:017 For they eat H3898 (8804) the bread H3899 of wickedness H7562, and drink H8354 (8799) the wine H3196 of violence H2555.
004:018 But the path H0734 of the just H6662 [is] as the shining H5051 light H0216, that shineth H0215 (8804) more H1980 (8802) and more unto the perfect H3559 (8737) day H3117.
004:019 The way H1870 of the wicked H7563 [is] as darkness H0653: they know H3045 (8804) not at what they stumble H3782 (8735).
004:020 My son H1121, attend H7181 (8685) to my words H1697; incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 unto my sayings H0561.
004:021 Let them not depart H3868 (8686) from thine eyes H5869; keep H8104 (8798) them in the midst H8432 of thine heart H3824.
004:022 For they [are] life H2416 unto those that find H4672 (8802) them, and health H4832 to all their flesh H1320.
004:023 Keep H5341 (8798) thy heart H3820 with all diligence H4929; for out of it [are] the issues H8444 of life H2416.
004:024 Put away H5493 (8685) from thee a froward H6143 mouth H6310, and perverse H3891 lips H8193 put far H7368 (8685) from thee.
004:025 Let thine eyes H5869 look H5027 (8686) right on H5227, and let thine eyelids H6079 look straight H3474 (8686) before thee.
004:026 Ponder H6424 (8761) the path H4570 of thy feet H7272, and let all thy ways H1870 be established H3559 (8735).
004:027 Turn H5186 (8799) not to the right hand H3225 nor to the left H8040: remove H5493 (8685) thy foot H7272 from evil H7451.
005:001 ¶ My son H1121, attend H7181 (8685) unto my wisdom H2451, [and] bow H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 to my understanding H8394:
005:002 That thou mayest regard H8104 (8800) discretion H4209, and [that] thy lips H8193 may keep H5341 (8799) knowledge H1847.
005:003 For the lips H8193 of a strange woman H2114 (8801) drop H5197 (8799) [as] an honeycomb H5317, and her mouth H2441 [is] smoother H2509 than oil H8081:
005:004 But her end H0319 is bitter H4751 as wormwood H3939, sharp H2299 as a twoedged H6310 sword H2719.
005:005 Her feet H7272 go down H3381 (8802) to death H4194; her steps H6806 take hold H8551 (8799) on hell H7585.
005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder H6424 (8762) the path H0734 of life H2416, her ways H4570 are moveable H5128 (8804), [that] thou canst not know H3045 (8799) [them].
005:007 Hear H8085 (8798) me now therefore, O ye children H1121, and depart H5493 (8799) not from the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
005:008 Remove H7368 thy way H1870 far H7368 (8685) from her, and come not nigh H7126 (8799) the door H6607 of her house H1004:
005:009 Lest thou give H5414 (8799) thine honour H1935 unto others H0312, and thy years H8141 unto the cruel H0394:
005:010 Lest strangers H2114 (8801) be filled H7646 (8799) with thy wealth H3581; and thy labours H6089 [be] in the house H1004 of a stranger H5237;
005:011 And thou mourn H5098 (8804) at the last H0319, when thy flesh H1320 and thy body H7607 are consumed H3615 (8800),
005:012 And say H0559 (8804), How have I hated H8130 (8804) instruction H4148, and my heart H3820 despised H5006 (8804) reproof H8433;
005:013 And have not obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of my teachers H3384 (8688), nor inclined H5186 (8689) mine ear H0241 to them that instructed H3925 (8764) me!
005:014 I was almost H4592 in all evil H7451 in the midst H8432 of the congregation H6951 and assembly H5712.
005:015 Drink H8354 (8798) waters H4325 out of thine own cistern H0953, and running waters H5140 (8802) out of H8432 thine own well H0875.
005:016 Let thy fountains H4599 be dispersed H6327 (8799) abroad H2351, [and] rivers H6388 of waters H4325 in the streets H7339.
005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers H2114 (8801) ’ with thee.
005:018 Let thy fountain H4726 be blessed H1288 (8803): and rejoice H8055 (8798) with the wife H0802 of thy youth H5271.
005:019 [Let her be as] the loving H0158 hind H0365 and pleasant H2580 roe H3280; let her breasts H1717 satisfy H7301 (8762) thee at all times H6256; and be thou ravished H7686 (8799) always H8548 with her love H0160.
005:020 And why wilt thou, my son H1121, be ravished H7686 (8799) with a strange woman H2114 (8801), and embrace H2263 (8762) the bosom H2436 of a stranger H5237?
005:021 For the ways H1870 of man H0376 [are] before H5227 the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068, and he pondereth H6424 (8764) all his goings H4570.
005:022 His own iniquities H5771 shall take H3920 (8799) the wicked H7563 himself, and he shall be holden H8551 (8735) with the cords H2256 of his sins H2403.
005:023 He shall die H4191 (8799) without instruction H4148; and in the greatness H7230 of his folly H0200 he shall go astray H7686 (8799).
006:001 ¶ My son H1121, if thou be surety H6148 (8804) for thy friend H7453, [if] thou hast stricken H8628 (8804) thy hand H3709 with a stranger H2114 (8801),
006:002 Thou art snared H3369 (8738) with the words H0561 of thy mouth H6310, thou art taken H3920 (8738) with the words H0561 of thy mouth H6310.
006:003 Do H6213 (8798) this now H0645, my son H1121, and deliver H5337 (8734) thyself, when thou art come H0935 (8804) into the hand H3709 of thy friend H7453; go H3212 (8798), humble H7511 (8690) thyself, and make sure H7292 (8798) thy friend H7453.
006:004 Give H5414 (8799) not sleep H8142 to thine eyes H5869, nor slumber H8572 to thine eyelids H6079.
006:005 Deliver H5337 (8734) thyself as a roe H6643 from the hand H3027 [of the hunter], and as a bird H6833 from the hand H3027 of the fowler H3353.
006:006 Go H3212 (8798) to the ant H5244, thou sluggard H6102; consider H7200 (8798) her ways H1870, and be wise H2449 (8798):
006:007 Which having no guide H7101, overseer H7860 (8802), or ruler H4910 (8802),
006:008 Provideth H3559 (8686) her meat H3899 in the summer H7019, [and] gathereth H0103 (8804) her food H3978 in the harvest H7105.
006:009 How long wilt thou sleep H7901 (8799), O sluggard H6102? when wilt thou arise H6965 (8799) out of thy sleep H8142?
006:010 [Yet] a little H4592 sleep H8142, a little H4592 slumber H8572, a little H4592 folding H2264 of the hands H3027 to sleep H7901 (8800):
006:011 So shall thy poverty H7389 come H0935 (8804) as one that travelleth H1980 (8764), and thy want H4270 as an armed H4043 man H0376.
006:012 A naughty H1100 person H0120, a wicked H0205 man H0376, walketh H1980 (8802) with a froward H6143 mouth H6310.
006:013 He winketh H7169 (8802) with his eyes H5869, he speaketh H4448 (8802) with his feet H7272, he teacheth H3384 (8688) with his fingers H0676;
006:014 Frowardness H8419 [is] in his heart H3820, he deviseth H2790 (8802) mischief H7451 continually H6256; he soweth H7971 (8762) discord H4066 (8675) H4090.
006:015 Therefore shall his calamity H0343 come H0935 (8799) suddenly H6597; suddenly H6621 shall he be broken H7665 (8735) without remedy H4832.
006:016 These six H8337 [things] doth the LORD H3068 hate H8130 (8804): yea, seven H7651 [are] an abomination H8441 unto him H5315:
006:017 A proud H7311 (8802) look H5869, a lying H8267 tongue H3956, and hands H3027 that shed H8210 (8802) innocent H5355 blood H1818,
006:018 An heart H3820 that deviseth H2790 (8802) wicked H0205 imaginations H4284, feet H7272 that be swift H4116 (8764) in running H7323 (8800) to mischief H7451,
006:019 A false H8267 witness H5707 [that] speaketh H6315 (8686) lies H3577, and he that soweth H7971 (8764) discord H4090 among brethren H0251.
006:020 My son H1121, keep H5341 (8798) thy father’s H0001 commandment H4687, and forsake H5203 (8799) not the law H8451 of thy mother H0517:
006:021 Bind H7194 (8798) them continually H8548 upon thine heart H3820, [and] tie H6029 (8798) them about thy neck H1621.
006:022 When thou goest H1980 (8692), it shall lead H5148 (8686) thee; when thou sleepest H7901 (8800), it shall keep H8104 (8799) thee; and [when] thou awakest H6974 (8689), it shall talk H7878 (8799) with thee.
006:023 For the commandment H4687 [is] a lamp H5216; and the law H8451 [is] light H0216; and reproofs H8433 of instruction H4148 [are] the way H1870 of life H2416:
006:024 To keep H8104 (8800) thee from the evil H7451 woman H0802, from the flattery H2513 of the tongue H3956 of a strange woman H5237.
006:025 Lust H2530 (8799) not after her beauty H3308 in thine heart H3824; neither let her take H3947 (8799) thee with her eyelids H6079.
006:026 For by means of H1157 a whorish H2181 (8802) woman H0802 [a man is brought] to a piece H3603 of bread H3899: and the adulteress H0802 H0376 will hunt H6679 (8799) for the precious H3368 life H5315.
006:027 Can a man H0376 take H2846 (8799) fire H0784 in his bosom H2436, and his clothes H0899 not be burned H8313 (8735)?
006:028 Can one H0376 go H1980 (8762) upon hot coals H1513, and his feet H7272 not be burned H3554 (8735)?
006:029 So he that goeth in H0935 (8802) to his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802; whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) her shall not be innocent H5352 (8735).
006:030 [Men] do not despise H0936 (8799) a thief H1590, if he steal H1589 (8799) to satisfy H4390 (8763) his soul H5315 when he is hungry H7456 (8799);
006:031 But [if] he be found H4672 (8738), he shall restore H7999 (8762) sevenfold H7659; he shall give H5414 (8799) all the substance H1952 of his house H1004.
006:032 [But] whoso committeth adultery H5003 (8802) with a woman H0802 lacketh H2638 understanding H3820: he [that] doeth H6213 (8799) it destroyeth H7843 (8688) his own soul H5315.
006:033 A wound H5061 and dishonour H7036 shall he get H4672 (8799); and his reproach H2781 shall not be wiped away H4229 (8735).
006:034 For jealousy H7068 [is] the rage H2534 of a man H1397: therefore he will not spare H2550 (8799) in the day H3117 of vengeance H5359.
006:035 He will not regard H5375 (8799) H6440 any ransom H3724; neither will he rest content H0014 (8799), though thou givest many H7235 (8686) gifts H7810.
007:001 ¶ My son H1121, keep H8104 (8798) my words H0561, and lay up H6845 (8799) my commandments H4687 with thee.
007:002 Keep H8104 (8798) my commandments H4687, and live H2421 (8798); and my law H8451 as the apple H0380 of thine eye H5869.
007:003 Bind H7194 (8798) them upon thy fingers H0676, write H3789 (8798) them upon the table H3871 of thine heart H3820.
007:004 Say H0559 (8798) unto wisdom H2451, Thou [art] my sister H0269; and call H7121 (8799) understanding H0998 [thy] kinswoman H4129:
007:005 That they may keep H8104 (8800) thee from the strange H2114 (8801) woman H0802, from the stranger H5237 [which] flattereth H2505 (8689) with her words H0561.
007:006 For at the window H2474 of my house H1004 I looked H8259 (8738) through my casement H0822,
007:007 And beheld H7200 (8799) among the simple ones H6612, I discerned H0995 (8799) among the youths H1121, a young man H5288 void H2638 of understanding H3820,
007:008 Passing through H5674 (8802) the street H7784 near H0681 her corner H6434; and he went H6805 (8799) the way H1870 to her house H1004,
007:009 In the twilight H5399, in the evening H3117 H6153, in the black H0380 and dark H0653 night H3915:
007:010 And, behold, there met H7125 (8800) him a woman H0802 [with] the attire H7897 of an harlot H2181 (8802), and subtil H5341 (8803) of heart H3820.
007:011 (She [is] loud H1993 (8802) and stubborn H5637 (8802); her feet H7272 abide H7931 (8799) not in her house H1004:
007:012 Now H6471 [is she] without H2351, now H6471 in the streets H7339, and lieth in wait H0693 (8799) at H0681 every corner H6438.)
007:013 So she caught H2388 (8689) him, and kissed H5401 (8804) him, [and] with an impudent H5810 (8689) face H6440 said H0559 (8799) unto him,
007:014 [I have] peace H8002 offerings H2077 with me; this day H3117 have I payed H7999 (8765) my vows H5088.
007:015 Therefore came I forth H3318 (8804) to meet H7125 (8800) thee, diligently to seek H7836 (8763) thy face H6440, and I have found H4672 (8799) thee.
007:016 I have decked H7234 (8804) my bed H6210 with coverings H4765 of tapestry, with carved H2405 [works], with fine linen H0330 of Egypt H4714.
007:017 I have perfumed H5130 (8804) my bed H4904 with myrrh H4753, aloes H0174, and cinnamon H7076.
007:018 Come H3212 (8798), let us take our fill H7301 (8799) of love H1730 until the morning H1242: let us solace H5965 (8691) ourselves with loves H0159.
007:019 For the goodman H0376 [is] not at home H1004, he is gone H1980 (8804) a long H7350 journey H1870:
007:020 He hath taken H3947 (8804) a bag H6872 of money H3701 with him H3027, [and] will come H0935 (8799) home H1004 at the day H3117 appointed H3677.
007:021 With her much H7230 fair speech H3948 she caused him to yield H5186 (8689), with the flattering H2506 of her lips H8193 she forced H5080 (8686) him.
007:022 He goeth H1980 (8802) after H0310 her straightway H6597, as an ox H7794 goeth H0935 (8799) to the slaughter H2874, or as a fool H0191 to the correction H4148 of the stocks H5914;
007:023 Till a dart H2671 strike H6398 (8762) through his liver H3516; as a bird H6833 hasteth H4116 (8763) to the snare H6341, and knoweth H3045 (8804) not that it [is] for his life H5315.
007:024 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me now therefore, O ye children H1121, and attend H7181 (8685) to the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
007:025 Let not thine heart H3820 decline H7847 (8799) to her ways H1870, go not astray H8582 (8799) in her paths H5410.
007:026 For she hath cast down H5307 (8689) many H7227 wounded H2491: yea, many strong H6099 [men] have been slain H2026 (8803) by her.
007:027 Her house H1004 [is] the way H1870 to hell H7585, going down H3381 (8802) to the chambers H2315 of death H4194.
008:001 ¶ Doth not wisdom H2451 cry H7121 (8799)? and understanding H8394 put forth H5414 (8799) her voice H6963?
008:002 She standeth H5324 (8738) in the top H7218 of high places H4791, by the way H1870 in the places H1004 of the paths H5410.
008:003 She crieth H7442 (8799) at H3027 the gates H8179, at the entry H6310 of the city H7176, at the coming H3996 in at the doors H6607.
008:004 Unto you, O men H0376, I call H7121 (8799); and my voice H6963 [is] to the sons H1121 of man H0120.
008:005 O ye simple H6612, understand H0995 (8685) wisdom H6195: and, ye fools H3684, be ye of an understanding H0995 (8685) heart H3820.
008:006 Hear H8085 (8798); for I will speak H1696 (8762) of excellent things H5057; and the opening H4669 of my lips H8193 [shall be] right things H4339.
008:007 For my mouth H2441 shall speak H1897 (8799) truth H0571; and wickedness H7562 [is] an abomination H8441 to my lips H8193.
008:008 All the words H0561 of my mouth H6310 [are] in righteousness H6664; [there is] nothing froward H6617 (8737) or perverse H6141 in them.
008:009 They [are] all plain H5228 to him that understandeth H0995 (8688), and right H3477 to them that find H4672 (8802) knowledge H1847.
008:010 Receive H3947 (8798) my instruction H4148, and not silver H3701; and knowledge H1847 rather than choice H0977 (8737) gold H2742.
008:011 For wisdom H2451 [is] better H2896 than rubies H6443; and all the things that may be desired H2656 are not to be compared H7737 (8799) to it.
008:012 I wisdom H2451 dwell H7931 (8804) with prudence H6195, and find out H4672 (8799) knowledge H1847 of witty inventions H4209.
008:013 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] to hate H8130 (8800) evil H7451: pride H1344, and arrogancy H1347, and the evil H7451 way H1870, and the froward H8419 mouth H6310, do I hate H8130 (8804).
008:014 Counsel H6098 [is] mine, and sound wisdom H8454: I [am] understanding H0998; I have strength H1369.
008:015 By me kings H4428 reign H4427 (8799), and princes H7336 (8802) decree H2710 (8779) justice H6664.
008:016 By me princes H8269 rule H8323 (8799), and nobles H5081, [even] all the judges H8199 (8802) of the earth H0776.
008:017 I love H0157 (8799) them that love H0157 (8802) me; and those that seek me early H7836 (8764) shall find H4672 (8799) me.
008:018 Riches H6239 and honour H3519 [are] with me; [yea], durable H6276 riches H1952 and righteousness H6666.
008:019 My fruit H6529 [is] better H2896 than gold H2742, yea, than fine gold H6337; and my revenue H8393 than choice H0977 (8737) silver H3701.
008:020 I lead H1980 (8762) in the way H0734 of righteousness H6666, in the midst H8432 of the paths H5410 of judgment H4941:
008:021 That I may cause those that love H0157 (8802) me to inherit H5157 (8687) substance H3426; and I will fill H4390 (8762) their treasures H0214.
008:022 The LORD H3068 possessed H7069 (8804) me in the beginning H7225 of his way H1870, before H6924 his works H4659 of old.
008:023 I was set up H5258 (8738) from everlasting H5769, from the beginning H7218, or ever H6924 the earth H0776 was.
008:024 When [there were] no depths H8415, I was brought forth H2342 (8797); when [there were] no fountains H4599 abounding H3513 (8737) with water H4325.
008:025 Before the mountains H2022 were settled H2883 (8717), before H6440 the hills H1389 was I brought forth H2342 (8797):
008:026 While as yet he had not made H6213 (8804) the earth H0776, nor the fields H2351, nor the highest part H7218 of the dust H6083 of the world H8398.
008:027 When he prepared H3559 (8687) the heavens H8064, I [was] there: when he set H2710 (8800) a compass H2329 upon the face H6440 of the depth H8415:
008:028 When he established H0553 (8763) the clouds H7834 above H4605: when he strengthened H5810 (8800) the fountains H5869 of the deep H8415:
008:029 When he gave H7760 (8800) to the sea H3220 his decree H2706, that the waters H4325 should not pass H5674 (8799) his commandment H6310: when he appointed H2710 (8800) the foundations H4144 of the earth H0776:
008:030 Then I was by him H0681, [as] one brought up H0525 [with him]: and I was daily H3117 H3117 [his] delight H8191, rejoicing H7832 (8764) always H6256 before H6440 him;
008:031 Rejoicing H7832 (8764) in the habitable part H8398 of his earth H0776; and my delights H8191 [were] with the sons H1121 of men H0120.
008:032 Now therefore hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, O ye children H1121: for blessed H0835 [are they that] keep H8104 (8799) my ways H1870.
008:033 Hear H8085 (8798) instruction H4148, and be wise H2449 (8798), and refuse H6544 (8799) it not.
008:034 Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0120 that heareth H8085 (8802) me, watching H8245 (8800) daily H3117 H3117 at my gates H1817, waiting H8104 (8800) at the posts H4201 of my doors H6607.
008:035 For whoso findeth H4672 (8802) me findeth H4672 (8804) (8675) H4672 (8802) life H2416, and shall obtain H6329 (8686) favour H7522 of the LORD H3068.
008:036 But he that sinneth H2398 (8802) against me wrongeth H2554 (8802) his own soul H5315: all they that hate H8130 (8764) me love H0157 (8804) death H4194.
009:001 ¶ Wisdom H2454 hath builded H1129 (8804) her house H1004, she hath hewn out H2672 (8804) her seven H7651 pillars H5982:
009:002 She hath killed H2873 (8804) her beasts H2874; she hath mingled H4537 (8804) her wine H3196; she hath also furnished H6186 (8804) her table H7979.
009:003 She hath sent forth H7971 (8804) her maidens H5291: she crieth H7121 (8799) upon H1610 the highest places H4791 of the city H7176,
009:004 Whoso [is] simple H6612, let him turn in H5493 (8799) hither: [as for] him that wanteth H2638 understanding H3820, she saith H0559 (8804) to him,
009:005 Come H3212 (8798), eat H3898 (8798) of my bread H3899, and drink H8354 (8798) of the wine H3196 [which] I have mingled H4537 (8804).
009:006 Forsake H5800 (8798) the foolish H6612, and live H2421 (8798); and go H0833 (8798) in the way H1870 of understanding H0998.
009:007 He that reproveth H3256 (8802) a scorner H3887 (8801) getteth H3947 (8802) to himself shame H7036: and he that rebuketh H3198 (8688) a wicked H7563 [man getteth] himself a blot H3971.
009:008 Reprove H3198 (8686) not a scorner H3887 (8801), lest he hate H8130 (8799) thee: rebuke H3198 (8685) a wise man H2450, and he will love H0157 (8799) thee.
009:009 Give H5414 (8798) [instruction] to a wise H2450 [man], and he will be yet wiser H2449 (8799): teach H3045 (8685) a just H6662 [man], and he will increase H3254 (8686) in learning H3948.
009:010 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] the beginning H8462 of wisdom H2451: and the knowledge H1847 of the holy H6918 [is] understanding H0998.
009:011 For by me thy days H3117 shall be multiplied H7235 (8799), and the years H8141 of thy life H2416 shall be increased H3254 (8686).
009:012 If thou be wise H2449 (8804), thou shalt be wise H2449 (8804) for thyself: but [if] thou scornest H3887 (8804), thou alone shalt bear H5375 (8799) [it].
009:013 A foolish H3687 woman H0802 [is] clamorous H1993 (8802): [she is] simple H6615, and H1077 knoweth H3045 (8804) nothing H4100.
009:014 For she sitteth H3427 (8804) at the door H6607 of her house H1004, on a seat H3678 in the high places H4791 of the city H7176,
009:015 To call H7121 (8800) passengers H5674 (8802) H1870 who go right H3474 (8764) on their ways H0734:
009:016 Whoso [is] simple H6612, let him turn in H5493 (8799) hither: and [as for] him that wanteth H2638 understanding H3820, she saith H0559 (8804) to him,
009:017 Stolen H1589 (8803) waters H4325 are sweet H4985 (8799), and bread H3899 [eaten] in secret H5643 is pleasant H5276 (8799).
009:018 But he knoweth H3045 (8804) not that the dead H7496 [are] there; [and that] her guests H7121 (8803) [are] in the depths H6012 of hell H7585.
010:001 ¶ The proverbs H4912 of Solomon H8010. A wise H2450 son H1121 maketh a glad H8055 (8762) father H0001: but a foolish H3684 son H1121 [is] the heaviness H8424 of his mother H0517.
010:002 Treasures H0214 of wickedness H7562 profit H3276 (8686) nothing: but righteousness H6666 delivereth H5337 (8686) from death H4194.
010:003 The LORD H3068 will not suffer H7456 the soul H5315 of the righteous H6662 to famish H7456 (8686): but he casteth away H1920 (8799) the substance H1942 of the wicked H7563.
010:004 He becometh poor H7326 (8802) that dealeth H6213 (8802) [with] a slack H7423 hand H3709: but the hand H3027 of the diligent H2742 maketh rich H6238 (8686).
010:005 He that gathereth H0103 (8802) in summer H7019 [is] a wise H7919 (8688) son H1121: [but] he that sleepeth H7290 (8737) in harvest H7105 [is] a son H1121 that causeth shame H0954 (8688).
010:006 Blessings H1293 [are] upon the head H7218 of the just H6662: but violence H2555 covereth H3680 (8762) the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563.
010:007 The memory H2143 of the just H6662 [is] blessed H1293: but the name H8034 of the wicked H7563 shall rot H7537 (8799).
010:008 The wise H2450 in heart H3820 will receive H3947 (8799) commandments H4687: but a prating H8193 fool H0191 shall fall H3832 (8735).
010:009 He that walketh H3212 (8799) uprightly H8537 walketh H1980 (8802) surely H0983: but he that perverteth H6140 (8764) his ways H1870 shall be known H3045 (8735).
010:010 He that winketh H7169 (8802) with the eye H5869 causeth H5414 (8799) sorrow H6094: but a prating H8193 fool H0191 shall fall H3832 (8735).
010:011 The mouth H6310 of a righteous H6662 [man is] a well H4726 of life H2416: but violence H2555 covereth H3680 (8762) the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563.
010:012 Hatred H8135 stirreth up H5782 (8787) strifes H4090: but love H0160 covereth H3680 (8762) all sins H6588.
010:013 In the lips H8193 of him that hath understanding H0995 (8737) wisdom H2451 is found H4672 (8735): but a rod H7626 [is] for the back H1460 of him that is void H2638 of understanding H3820.
010:014 Wise H2450 [men] lay up H6845 (8799) knowledge H1847: but the mouth H6310 of the foolish H0191 [is] near H7138 destruction H4288.
010:015 The rich man’s H6223 wealth H1952 [is] his strong H5797 city H7151: the destruction H4288 of the poor H1800 [is] their poverty H7389.
010:016 The labour H6468 of the righteous H6662 [tendeth] to life H2416: the fruit H8393 of the wicked H7563 to sin H2403.
010:017 He [is in] the way H0734 of life H2416 that keepeth H8104 (8802) instruction H4148: but he that refuseth H5800 (8802) reproof H8433 erreth H8582 (8688).
010:018 He that hideth H3680 (8764) hatred H8135 [with] lying H8267 lips H8193, and he that uttereth H3318 (8688) a slander H1681, [is] a fool H3684.
010:019 In the multitude H7230 of words H1697 there wanteth H2308 (8799) not sin H6588: but he that refraineth H2820 (8802) his lips H8193 [is] wise H7919 (8688).
010:020 The tongue H3956 of the just H6662 [is as] choice H0977 (8737) silver H3701: the heart H3820 of the wicked H7563 [is] little worth H4592.
010:021 The lips H8193 of the righteous H6662 feed H7462 (8799) many H7227: but fools H0191 die H4191 (8799) for want H2638 of wisdom H3820.
010:022 The blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068, it maketh rich H6238 (8686), and he addeth H3254 (8686) no sorrow H6089 with it.
010:023 [It is] as sport H7814 to a fool H3684 to do H6213 (8800) mischief H2154: but a man H0376 of understanding H8394 hath wisdom H2451.
010:024 The fear H4034 of the wicked H7563, it shall come H0935 (8799) upon him: but the desire H8378 of the righteous H6662 shall be granted H5414 (8799).
010:025 As the whirlwind H5492 passeth H5674 (8800), so [is] the wicked H7563 no [more]: but the righteous H6662 [is] an everlasting H5769 foundation H3247.
010:026 As vinegar H2558 to the teeth H8127, and as smoke H6227 to the eyes H5869, so [is] the sluggard H6102 to them that send H7971 (8802) him.
010:027 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 prolongeth H3254 (8686) days H3117: but the years H8141 of the wicked H7563 shall be shortened H7114 (8799).
010:028 The hope H8431 of the righteous H6662 [shall be] gladness H8057: but the expectation H8615 of the wicked H7563 shall perish H0006 (8799).
010:029 The way H1870 of the LORD H3068 [is] strength H4581 to the upright H8537: but destruction H4288 [shall be] to the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205.
010:030 The righteous H6662 shall never H5769 be removed H4131 (8735): but the wicked H7563 shall not inhabit H7931 (8799) the earth H0776.
010:031 The mouth H6310 of the just H6662 bringeth forth H5107 (8799) wisdom H2451: but the froward H8419 tongue H3956 shall be cut out H3772 (8735).
010:032 The lips H8193 of the righteous H6662 know H3045 (8799) what is acceptable H7522: but the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563 [speaketh] frowardness H8419.
011:001 ¶ A false H4820 balance H3976 [is] abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but a just H8003 weight H0068 [is] his delight H7522.
011:002 [When] pride H2087 cometh H0935 (8804), then cometh H0935 (8799) shame H7036: but with the lowly H6800 (8803) [is] wisdom H2451.
011:003 The integrity H8538 of the upright H3477 shall guide H5148 (8686) them: but the perverseness H5558 of transgressors H0898 (8802) shall destroy H7703 (8799) (8675) H7703 (8804) them.
011:004 Riches H1952 profit H3276 (8686) not in the day H3117 of wrath H5678: but righteousness H6666 delivereth H5337 (8686) from death H4194.
011:005 The righteousness H6666 of the perfect H8549 shall direct H3474 (8762) his way H1870: but the wicked H7563 shall fall H5307 (8799) by his own wickedness H7564.
011:006 The righteousness H6666 of the upright H3477 shall deliver H5337 (8686) them: but transgressors H0898 (8802) shall be taken H3920 (8735) in [their own] naughtiness H1942.
011:007 When a wicked H7563 man H0120 dieth H4194, [his] expectation H8615 shall perish H0006 (8799): and the hope H8431 of unjust H0205 [men] perisheth H0006 (8804).
011:008 The righteous H6662 is delivered out H2502 (8738) of trouble H6869, and the wicked H7563 cometh H0935 (8799) in his stead.
011:009 An hypocrite H2611 with [his] mouth H6310 destroyeth H7843 (8686) his neighbour H7453: but through knowledge H1847 shall the just H6662 be delivered H2502 (8735).
011:010 When it goeth well H2898 with the righteous H6662, the city H7151 rejoiceth H5970 (8799): and when the wicked H7563 perish H0006 (8800), [there is] shouting H7440.
011:011 By the blessing H1293 of the upright H3477 the city H7176 is exalted H7311 (8799): but it is overthrown H2040 (8735) by the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563.
011:012 He that is void H2638 of wisdom H3820 despiseth H0936 (8802) his neighbour H7453: but a man H0376 of understanding H8394 holdeth his peace H2790 (8686).
011:013 A talebearer H1980 (8802) H7400 revealeth H1540 (8764) secrets H5475: but he that is of a faithful H0539 (8738) spirit H7307 concealeth H3680 (8764) the matter H1697.
011:014 Where no counsel H8458 [is], the people H5971 fall H5307 (8799): but in the multitude H7230 of counsellors H3289 (8802) [there is] safety H8668.
011:015 He that is surety H6148 (8804) for a stranger H2114 (8801) shall smart H7321 (8735) H7451 [for it]: and he that hateth H8130 (8802) suretiship H8628 (8802) is sure H0982 (8802).
011:016 A gracious H2580 woman H0802 retaineth H8551 (8799) honour H3519: and strong H6184 [men] retain H8551 (8799) riches H6239.
011:017 The merciful H2617 man H0376 doeth good H1580 (8802) to his own soul H5315: but [he that is] cruel H0394 troubleth H5916 (8802) his own flesh H7607.
011:018 The wicked H7563 worketh H6213 (8802) a deceitful H8267 work H6468: but to him that soweth H2232 (8802) righteousness H6666 [shall be] a sure H0571 reward H7938.
011:019 As righteousness H6666 [tendeth] to life H2416: so he that pursueth H7291 (8764) evil H7451 [pursueth it] to his own death H4194.
011:020 They that are of a froward H6141 heart H3820 [are] abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but [such as are] upright H8549 in [their] way H1870 [are] his delight H7522.
011:021 [Though] hand H3027 [join] in hand H3027, the wicked H7451 shall not be unpunished H5352 (8735): but the seed H2233 of the righteous H6662 shall be delivered H4422 (8738).
011:022 [As] a jewel H5141 of gold H2091 in a swine’s H2386 snout H0639, [so is] a fair H3303 woman H0802 which is without H5493 (8802) discretion H2940.
011:023 The desire H8378 of the righteous H6662 [is] only good H2896: [but] the expectation H8615 of the wicked H7563 [is] wrath H5678.
011:024 There is H3426 that scattereth H6340 (8764), and yet increaseth H3254 (8737); and [there is] that withholdeth H2820 (8802) more than is meet H3476, but [it tendeth] to poverty H4270.
011:025 The liberal H1293 soul H5315 shall be made fat H1878 (8792): and he that watereth H7301 (8688) shall be watered H3384 (8686) also himself.
011:026 He that withholdeth H4513 (8802) corn H1250, the people H3816 shall curse H5344 (8799) him: but blessing H1293 [shall be] upon the head H7218 of him that selleth H7666 (8688) [it].
011:027 He that diligently seeketh H7836 (8802) good H2896 procureth H1245 (8762) favour H7522: but he that seeketh H1875 (8802) mischief H7451, it shall come H0935 (8799) unto him.
011:028 He that trusteth H0982 (8802) in his riches H6239 shall fall H5307 (8799): but the righteous H6662 shall flourish H6524 (8799) as a branch H5929.
011:029 He that troubleth H5916 (8802) his own house H1004 shall inherit H5157 (8799) the wind H7307: and the fool H0191 [shall be] servant H5650 to the wise H2450 of heart H3820.
011:030 The fruit H6529 of the righteous H6662 [is] a tree H6086 of life H2416; and he that winneth H3947 (8802) souls H5315 [is] wise H2450.
011:031 Behold, the righteous H6662 shall be recompensed H7999 (8792) in the earth H0776: much more the wicked H7563 and the sinner H2398 (8802).
012:001 ¶ Whoso loveth H0157 (8802) instruction H4148 loveth H0157 (8802) knowledge H1847: but he that hateth H8130 (8802) reproof H8433 [is] brutish H1198.
012:002 A good H2896 [man] obtaineth H6329 (8686) favour H7522 of the LORD H3068: but a man H0376 of wicked devices H4209 will he condemn H7561 (8686).
012:003 A man H0120 shall not be established H3559 (8735) by wickedness H7562: but the root H8328 of the righteous H6662 shall not be moved H4131 (8735).
012:004 A virtuous H2428 woman H0802 [is] a crown H5850 to her husband H1167: but she that maketh ashamed H0954 (8688) [is] as rottenness H7538 in his bones H6106.
012:005 The thoughts H4284 of the righteous H6662 [are] right H4941: [but] the counsels H8458 of the wicked H7563 [are] deceit H4820.
012:006 The words H1697 of the wicked H7563 [are] to lie in wait H0693 (8800) for blood H1818: but the mouth H6310 of the upright H3477 shall deliver H5337 (8686) them.
012:007 The wicked H7563 are overthrown H2015 (8800), and [are] not: but the house H1004 of the righteous H6662 shall stand H5975 (8799).
012:008 A man H0376 shall be commended H1984 (8792) according H6310 to his wisdom H7922: but he that is of a perverse H5753 (8737) heart H3820 shall be despised H0937.
012:009 [He that is] despised H7034 (8737), and hath a servant H5650, [is] better H2896 than he that honoureth H3513 (8693) himself, and lacketh H2638 bread H3899.
012:010 A righteous H6662 [man] regardeth H3045 (8802) the life H5315 of his beast H0929: but the tender mercies H7356 of the wicked H7563 [are] cruel H0394.
012:011 He that tilleth H5647 (8802) his land H0127 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) with bread H3899: but he that followeth H7291 (8764) vain H7386 [persons is] void H2638 of understanding H3820.
012:012 The wicked H7563 desireth H2530 (8804) the net H4685 of evil H7451 [men]: but the root H8328 of the righteous H6662 yieldeth H5414 (8799) [fruit].
012:013 The wicked H7451 is snared H4170 by the transgression H6588 of [his] lips H8193: but the just H6662 shall come out H3318 (8799) of trouble H6869.
012:014 A man H0376 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) with good H2896 by the fruit H6529 of [his] mouth H6310: and the recompence H1576 of a man’s H0120 hands H3027 shall be rendered H7725 (8686) (8675) H7725 (8799) unto him.
012:015 The way H1870 of a fool H0191 [is] right H3477 in his own eyes H5869: but he that hearkeneth H8085 (8802) unto counsel H6098 [is] wise H2450.
012:016 A fool’s H0191 wrath H3708 is presently H3117 known H3045 (8735): but a prudent H6175 [man] covereth H3680 (8802) shame H7036.
012:017 [He that] speaketh H6315 (8686) truth H0530 sheweth forth H5046 (8686) righteousness H6664: but a false H8267 witness H5707 deceit H4820.
012:018 There is H3426 that speaketh H0981 (8802) like the piercings H4094 of a sword H2719: but the tongue H3956 of the wise H2450 [is] health H4832.
012:019 The lip H8193 of truth H0571 shall be established H3559 (8735) for ever H5703: but a lying H8267 tongue H3956 [is] but for a moment H7280 (8686).
012:020 Deceit H4820 [is] in the heart H3820 of them that imagine H2790 (8802) evil H7451: but to the counsellors H3289 (8802) of peace H7965 [is] joy H8057.
012:021 There shall no evil H0205 happen H0579 (8792) to the just H6662: but the wicked H7563 shall be filled H4390 (8804) with mischief H7451.
012:022 Lying H8267 lips H8193 [are] abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but they that deal H6213 (8802) truly H0530 [are] his delight H7522.
012:023 A prudent H6175 man H0120 concealeth H3680 (8802) knowledge H1847: but the heart H3820 of fools H3684 proclaimeth H7121 (8799) foolishness H0200.
012:024 The hand H3027 of the diligent H2742 shall bear rule H4910 (8799): but the slothful H7423 shall be under tribute H4522.
012:025 Heaviness H1674 in the heart H3820 of man H0376 maketh it stoop H7812 (8686): but a good H2896 word H1697 maketh it glad H8055 (8762).
012:026 The righteous H6662 [is] more excellent H8446 (8686) than his neighbour H7453: but the way H1870 of the wicked H7563 seduceth H8582 (8686) them.
012:027 The slothful H7423 [man] roasteth H2760 (8799) not that which he took in hunting H6718: but the substance H1952 of a diligent H2742 man H0120 [is] precious H3368.
012:028 In the way H0734 of righteousness H6666 [is] life H2416; and [in] the pathway H5410 H1870 [thereof there is] no death H4194.
013:001 ¶ A wise H2450 son H1121 [heareth] his father’s H0001 instruction H4148: but a scorner H3887 (8801) heareth H8085 (8804) not rebuke H1606.
013:002 A man H0376 shall eat H0398 (8799) good H2896 by the fruit H6529 of [his] mouth H6310: but the soul H5315 of the transgressors H0898 (8802) [shall eat] violence H2555.
013:003 He that keepeth H5341 (8802) his mouth H6310 keepeth H8104 (8802) his life H5315: [but] he that openeth wide H6589 (8802) his lips H8193 shall have destruction H4288.
013:004 The soul H5315 of the sluggard H6102 desireth H0183 (8693), and [hath] nothing: but the soul H5315 of the diligent H2742 shall be made fat H1878 (8792).
013:005 A righteous H6662 [man] hateth H8130 (8799) lying H1697 H8267: but a wicked H7563 [man] is loathsome H0887 (8686), and cometh to shame H2659 (8686).
013:006 Righteousness H6666 keepeth H5341 (8799) [him that is] upright H8537 in the way H1870: but wickedness H7564 overthroweth H5557 (8762) the sinner H2403.
013:007 There is H3426 that maketh himself rich H6238 (8693), yet [hath] nothing: [there is] that maketh himself poor H7326 (8711), yet H3605 [hath] great H7227 riches H1952.
013:008 The ransom H3724 of a man’s H0376 life H5315 [are] his riches H6239: but the poor H7326 (8802) heareth H8085 (8804) not rebuke H1606.
013:009 The light H0216 of the righteous H6662 rejoiceth H8055 (8799): but the lamp H5216 of the wicked H7563 shall be put out H1846 (8799).
013:010 Only by pride H2087 cometh H5414 (8799) contention H4683: but with the well advised H3289 (8737) [is] wisdom H2451.
013:011 Wealth H1952 [gotten] by vanity H1892 shall be diminished H4591 (8799): but he that gathereth H6908 (8802) by labour H3027 shall increase H7235 (8686).
013:012 Hope H8431 deferred H4900 (8794) maketh the heart H3820 sick H2470 (8688): but [when] the desire H8378 cometh H0935 (8802), [it is] a tree H6086 of life H2416.
013:013 Whoso despiseth H0936 (8802) the word H1697 shall be destroyed H2254 (8735): but he that feareth H3373 the commandment H4687 shall be rewarded H7999 (8792).
013:014 The law H8451 of the wise H2450 [is] a fountain H4726 of life H2416, to depart H5493 (8800) from the snares H4170 of death H4194.
013:015 Good H2896 understanding H7922 giveth H5414 (8799) favour H2580: but the way H1870 of transgressors H0898 (8802) [is] hard H0386.
013:016 Every prudent H6175 [man] dealeth H6213 (8799) with knowledge H1847: but a fool H3684 layeth open H6566 (8799) [his] folly H0200.
013:017 A wicked H7563 messenger H4397 falleth H5307 (8799) into mischief H7451: but a faithful H0529 ambassador H6735 [is] health H4832.
013:018 Poverty H7389 and shame H7036 [shall be to] him that refuseth H6544 (8802) instruction H4148: but he that regardeth H8104 (8802) reproof H8433 shall be honoured H3513 (8792).
013:019 The desire H8378 accomplished H1961 (8738) is sweet H6149 (8799) to the soul H5315: but [it is] abomination H8441 to fools H3684 to depart H5493 (8800) from evil H7451.
013:020 He that walketh H1980 (8802) with wise H2450 [men] shall be wise H2449 (8799): but a companion H7462 (8802) of fools H3684 shall be destroyed H7321 (8735).
013:021 Evil H7451 pursueth H7291 (8762) sinners H2400: but to the righteous H6662 good H2896 shall be repayed H7999 (8762).
013:022 A good H2896 [man] leaveth an inheritance H5157 (8686) to his children’s H1121 children H1121: and the wealth H2428 of the sinner H2398 (8802) [is] laid up H6845 (8803) for the just H6662.
013:023 Much H7230 food H0400 [is in] the tillage H5215 of the poor H7218 (8676) H7326 (8802): but there is H3426 [that is] destroyed H5595 (8737) for want H3808 of judgment H4941.
013:024 He that spareth H2820 (8802) his rod H7626 hateth H8130 (8802) his son H1121: but he that loveth H0157 (8802) him chasteneth H4148 him betimes H7836 (8765).
013:025 The righteous H6662 eateth H0398 (8802) to the satisfying H7648 of his soul H5315: but the belly H0990 of the wicked H7563 shall want H2637 (8799).
014:001 ¶ Every wise H2454 woman H0802 buildeth H1129 (8804) her house H1004: but the foolish H0200 plucketh it down H2040 (8799) with her hands H3027.
014:002 He that walketh H1980 (8802) in his uprightness H3476 feareth H3373 the LORD H3068: but [he that is] perverse H3868 (8737) in his ways H1870 despiseth H0959 (8802) him.
014:003 In the mouth H6310 of the foolish H0191 [is] a rod H2415 of pride H1346: but the lips H8193 of the wise H2450 shall preserve H8104 (8799) them.
014:004 Where no oxen H0504 [are], the crib H0018 [is] clean H1249: but much H7230 increase H8393 [is] by the strength H3581 of the ox H7794.
014:005 A faithful H0529 witness H5707 will not lie H3577: but a false H8267 witness H5707 will utter H6315 (8686) lies H3576 (8762).
014:006 A scorner H3887 (8801) seeketh H1245 (8765) wisdom H2451, and [findeth it] not: but knowledge H1847 [is] easy H7043 (8738) unto him that understandeth H0995 (8737).
014:007 Go H3212 (8798) from the presence H5048 of a foolish H3684 man H0376, when thou perceivest H3045 (8804) not [in him] the lips H8193 of knowledge H1847.
014:008 The wisdom H2451 of the prudent H6175 [is] to understand H0995 (8687) his way H1870: but the folly H0200 of fools H3684 [is] deceit H4820.
014:009 Fools H0191 make a mock H3887 (8686) at sin H0817: but among the righteous H3477 [there is] favour H7522.
014:010 The heart H3820 knoweth H3045 (8802) his own H5315 bitterness H4787; and a stranger H2114 (8801) doth not intermeddle H6148 (8691) with his joy H8057.
014:011 The house H1004 of the wicked H7563 shall be overthrown H8045 (8735): but the tabernacle H0168 of the upright H3477 shall flourish H6524 (8686).
014:012 There is H3426 a way H1870 which seemeth right H3477 unto H6440 a man H0376, but the end H0319 thereof [are] the ways H1870 of death H4194.
014:013 Even in laughter H7814 the heart H3820 is sorrowful H3510 (8799); and the end H0319 of that mirth H8057 [is] heaviness H8424.
014:014 The backslider H5472 (8803) in heart H3820 shall be filled H7646 (8799) with his own ways H1870: and a good H2896 man H0376 [shall be satisfied] from himself.
014:015 The simple H6612 believeth H0539 (8686) every word H1697: but the prudent H6175 [man] looketh well H0995 (8799) to his going H0838.
014:016 A wise H2450 [man] feareth H3373, and departeth H5493 (8802) from evil H7451: but the fool H3684 rageth H5674 (8693), and is confident H0982 (8802).
014:017 [He that is] soon H7116 angry H0639 dealeth H6213 (8799) foolishly H0200: and a man H0376 of wicked devices H4209 is hated H8130 (8735).
014:018 The simple H6612 inherit H5157 (8804) folly H0200: but the prudent H6175 are crowned H3803 (8686) with knowledge H1847.
014:019 The evil H7451 bow H7817 (8804) before H6440 the good H2896; and the wicked H7563 at the gates H8179 of the righteous H6662.
014:020 The poor H7326 (8802) is hated H8130 (8735) even of his own neighbour H7453: but the rich H6223 [hath] many H7227 friends H0157 (8802).
014:021 He that despiseth H0936 (8802) his neighbour H7453 sinneth H2398 (8802): but he that hath mercy H2603 (8781) on the poor H6035 (8675) H6041, happy H0835 [is] he.
014:022 Do they not err H8582 (8799) that devise H2790 (8802) evil H7451? but mercy H2617 and truth H0571 [shall be] to them that devise H2790 (8802) good H2896.
014:023 In all labour H6089 there is profit H4195: but the talk H1697 of the lips H8193 [tendeth] only to penury H4270.
014:024 The crown H5850 of the wise H2450 [is] their riches H6239: [but] the foolishness H0200 of fools H3684 [is] folly H0200.
014:025 A true H0571 witness H5707 delivereth H5337 (8688) souls H5315: but a deceitful H4820 [witness] speaketh H6315 (8686) lies H3577.
014:026 In the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] strong H5797 confidence H4009: and his children H1121 shall have a place of refuge H4268.
014:027 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] a fountain H4726 of life H2416, to depart H5493 (8800) from the snares H4170 of death H4194.
014:028 In the multitude H7230 of people H5971 [is] the king’s H4428 honour H1927: but in the want H0657 of people H3816 [is] the destruction H4288 of the prince H7333.
014:029 [He that is] slow H0750 to wrath H0639 [is] of great H7227 understanding H8394: but [he that is] hasty H7116 of spirit H7307 exalteth H7311 (8688) folly H0200.
014:030 A sound H4832 heart H3820 [is] the life H2416 of the flesh H1320: but envy H7068 the rottenness H7538 of the bones H6106.
014:031 He that oppresseth H6231 (8802) the poor H1800 reproacheth H2778 (8765) his Maker H6213 (8802): but he that honoureth H3513 (8764) him hath mercy H2603 (8802) on the poor H0034.
014:032 The wicked H7563 is driven away H1760 (8735) in his wickedness H7451: but the righteous H6662 hath hope H2620 (8802) in his death H4194.
014:033 Wisdom H2451 resteth H5117 (8799) in the heart H3820 of him that hath understanding H0995 (8737): but [that which is] in the midst H7130 of fools H3684 is made known H3045 (8735).
014:034 Righteousness H6666 exalteth H7311 (8787) a nation H1471: but sin H2403 [is] a reproach H2617 to any people H3816.
014:035 The king’s H4428 favour H7522 [is] toward a wise H7919 (8688) servant H5650: but his wrath H5678 is [against] him that causeth shame H0954 (8688).
015:001 ¶ A soft H7390 answer H4617 turneth H7725 (8686) away wrath H2534: but grievous H6089 words H1697 stir up H5927 (8686) anger H0639.
015:002 The tongue H3956 of the wise H2450 useth knowledge H1847 aright H3190 (8686): but the mouth H6310 of fools H3684 poureth out H5042 (8686) foolishness H0200.
015:003 The eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 [are] in every place H4725, beholding H6822 (8802) the evil H7451 and the good H2896.
015:004 A wholesome H4832 tongue H3956 [is] a tree H6086 of life H2416: but perverseness H5558 therein [is] a breach H7667 in the spirit H7307.
015:005 A fool H0191 despiseth H5006 (8799) his father’s H0001 instruction H4148: but he that regardeth H8104 (8802) reproof H8433 is prudent H6191 (8686).
015:006 In the house H1004 of the righteous H6662 [is] much H7227 treasure H2633: but in the revenues H8393 of the wicked H7563 is trouble H5916 (8737).
015:007 The lips H8193 of the wise H2450 disperse H2219 (8762) knowledge H1847: but the heart H3820 of the foolish H3684 [doeth] not so.
015:008 The sacrifice H2077 of the wicked H7563 [is] an abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but the prayer H8605 of the upright H3477 [is] his delight H7522.
015:009 The way H1870 of the wicked H7563 [is] an abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068: but he loveth H0157 (8799) him that followeth H7291 (8764) after righteousness H6666.
015:010 Correction H4148 [is] grievous H7451 unto him that forsaketh H5800 (8802) the way H0734: [and] he that hateth H8130 (8802) reproof H8433 shall die H4191 (8799).
015:011 Hell H7585 and destruction H0011 [are] before the LORD H3068: how much more then the hearts H3826 of the children H1121 of men H0120?
015:012 A scorner H3887 (8801) loveth H0157 (8799) not one that reproveth H3198 (8687) him: neither will he go H3212 (8799) unto the wise H2450.
015:013 A merry H8056 heart H3820 maketh a cheerful H3190 (8686) countenance H6440: but by sorrow H6094 of the heart H3820 the spirit H7307 is broken H5218.
015:014 The heart H3820 of him that hath understanding H0995 (8737) seeketh H1245 (8762) knowledge H1847: but the mouth H6310 (8675) H6440 of fools H3684 feedeth H7462 (8799) on foolishness H0200.
015:015 All the days H3117 of the afflicted H6041 [are] evil H7451: but he that is of a merry H2896 heart H3820 [hath] a continual H8548 feast H4960.
015:016 Better H2896 [is] little H4592 with the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 than great H7227 treasure H0214 and trouble H4103 therewith.
015:017 Better H2896 [is] a dinner H0737 of herbs H3419 where love H0160 is, than a stalled H0075 (8803) ox H7794 and hatred H8135 therewith.
015:018 A wrathful H2534 man H0376 stirreth up H1624 (8762) strife H4066: but [he that is] slow H0750 to anger H0639 appeaseth H8252 (8686) strife H7379.
015:019 The way H1870 of the slothful H6102 [man is] as an hedge H4881 of thorns H2312: but the way H0734 of the righteous H3477 [is] made plain H5549 (8803).
015:020 A wise H2450 son H1121 maketh a glad H8055 (8762) father H0001: but a foolish H3684 man H0120 despiseth H0959 (8802) his mother H0517.
015:021 Folly H0200 [is] joy H8057 to [him that is] destitute H2638 of wisdom H3820: but a man H0376 of understanding H8394 walketh H3212 (8800) uprightly H3474 (8762).
015:022 Without counsel H5475 purposes H4284 are disappointed H6565 (8687): but in the multitude H7230 of counsellors H3289 (8802) they are established H6965 (8799).
015:023 A man H0376 hath joy H8057 by the answer H4617 of his mouth H6310: and a word H1697 [spoken] in due season H6256, how good H2896 [is it]!
015:024 The way H0734 of life H2416 [is] above H4605 to the wise H7919 (8688), that he may depart H5493 (8800) from hell H7585 beneath H4295.
015:025 The LORD H3068 will destroy H5255 (8799) the house H1004 of the proud H1343: but he will establish H5324 (8686) the border H1366 of the widow H0490.
015:026 The thoughts H4284 of the wicked H7451 [are] an abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: but [the words] of the pure H2889 [are] pleasant H5278 words H0561.
015:027 He that is greedy H1214 (8802) of gain H1215 troubleth H5916 (8802) his own house H1004; but he that hateth H8130 (8802) gifts H4979 shall live H2421 (8799).
015:028 The heart H3820 of the righteous H6662 studieth H1897 (8799) to answer H6030 (8800): but the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563 poureth H5042 (8686) out evil things H7451.
015:029 The LORD H3068 [is] far H7350 from the wicked H7563: but he heareth H8085 (8799) the prayer H8605 of the righteous H6662.
015:030 The light H3974 of the eyes H5869 rejoiceth H8055 (8762) the heart H3820: [and] a good H2896 report H8052 maketh H1878 the bones H6106 fat H1878 (8762).
015:031 The ear H0241 that heareth H8085 (8802) the reproof H8433 of life H2416 abideth H3885 (8799) among H7130 the wise H2450.
015:032 He that refuseth H6544 (8802) instruction H4148 despiseth H3988 (8802) his own soul H5315: but he that heareth H8085 (8802) reproof H8433 getteth H7069 (8802) understanding H3820.
015:033 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] the instruction H4148 of wisdom H2451; and before H6440 honour H3519 [is] humility H6038.
016:001 ¶ The preparations H4633 of the heart H3820 in man H0120, and the answer H4617 of the tongue H3956, [is] from the LORD H3068.
016:002 All the ways H1870 of a man H0376 [are] clean H2134 in his own eyes H5869; but the LORD H3068 weigheth H8505 (8802) the spirits H7307.
016:003 Commit H1556 (8798) thy works H4639 unto the LORD H3068, and thy thoughts H4284 shall be established H3559 (8735).
016:004 The LORD H3068 hath made H6466 (8804) all [things] for himself H4617: yea, even the wicked H7563 for the day H3117 of evil H7451.
016:005 Every one [that is] proud H1362 in heart H3820 [is] an abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068: [though] hand H3027 [join] in hand H3027, he shall not be unpunished H5352 (8735).
016:006 By mercy H2617 and truth H0571 iniquity H5771 is purged H3722 (8792): and by the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [men] depart H5493 (8800) from evil H7451.
016:007 When a man’s H0376 ways H1870 please H7521 (8800) the LORD H3068, he maketh even his enemies H0341 (8802) to be at peace H7999 (8686) with him.
016:008 Better H2896 [is] a little H4592 with righteousness H6666 than great H7230 revenues H8393 without right H4941.
016:009 A man’s H0120 heart H3820 deviseth H2803 (8762) his way H1870: but the LORD H3068 directeth H3559 (8686) his steps H6806.
016:010 A divine sentence H7081 [is] in the lips H8193 of the king H4428: his mouth H6310 transgresseth H4603 (8799) not in judgment H4941.
016:011 A just H4941 weight H6425 and balance H3976 [are] the LORD’S H3068: all the weights H0068 of the bag H3599 [are] his work H4639.
016:012 [It is] an abomination H8441 to kings H4428 to commit H6213 (8800) wickedness H7562: for the throne H3678 is established H3559 (8735) by righteousness H6666.
016:013 Righteous H6664 lips H8193 [are] the delight H7522 of kings H4428; and they love H0157 (8799) him that speaketh H1696 (8802) right H3477.
016:014 The wrath H2534 of a king H4428 [is as] messengers H4397 of death H4194: but a wise H2450 man H0376 will pacify H3722 (8762) it.
016:015 In the light H0216 of the king’s H4428 countenance H6440 [is] life H2416; and his favour H7522 [is] as a cloud H5645 of the latter rain H4456.
016:016 How much better H2896 [is it] to get H7069 (8800) wisdom H2451 than gold H2742! and to get H7069 (8800) understanding H0998 rather to be chosen H0977 (8737) than silver H3701!
016:017 The highway H4546 of the upright H3477 [is] to depart H5493 (8800) from evil H7451: he that keepeth H5341 (8802) his way H1870 preserveth H8104 (8802) his soul H5315.
016:018 Pride H1347 [goeth] before H6440 destruction H7667, and an haughty H1363 spirit H7307 before H6440 a fall H3783.
016:019 Better H2896 [it is to be] of an humble H8217 spirit H7307 with the lowly H6035 (8675) H6041, than to divide H2505 (8763) the spoil H7998 with the proud H1343.
016:020 He that handleth a matter H1697 wisely H7919 (8688) shall find H4672 (8799) good H2896: and whoso trusteth H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068, happy H0835 [is] he.
016:021 The wise H2450 in heart H3820 shall be called H7121 (8735) prudent H0995 (8737): and the sweetness H4986 of the lips H8193 increaseth H3254 (8686) learning H3948.
016:022 Understanding H7922 [is] a wellspring H4726 of life H2416 unto him that hath H1167 it: but the instruction H4148 of fools H0191 [is] folly H0200.
016:023 The heart H3820 of the wise H2450 teacheth H7919 (8686) his mouth H6310, and addeth H3254 (8686) learning H3948 to his lips H8193.
016:024 Pleasant H5278 words H0561 [are as] an honeycomb H6688 H1706, sweet H4966 to the soul H5315, and health H4832 to the bones H6106.
016:025 There is H3426 a way H1870 that seemeth right H3477 unto H6440 a man H0376, but the end H0319 thereof [are] the ways H1870 of death H4194.
016:026 He H5315 that laboureth H6001 laboureth H5998 (8804) for himself; for his mouth H6310 craveth H0404 (8804) it of him.
016:027 An ungodly H1100 man H0376 diggeth up H3738 (8802) evil H7451: and in his lips H8193 [there is] as a burning H6867 fire H0784.
016:028 A froward H8419 man H0376 soweth H7971 (8762) strife H4066: and a whisperer H5372 separateth H6504 (8688) chief friends H0441.
016:029 A violent H2555 man H0376 enticeth H6601 (8762) his neighbour H7453, and leadeth H3212 (8689) him into the way H1870 [that is] not good H2896.
016:030 He shutteth H6095 (8802) his eyes H5869 to devise H2803 (8800) froward things H8419: moving H7169 (8802) his lips H8193 he bringeth H3615 evil H7451 to pass H3615 (8765).
016:031 The hoary head H7872 [is] a crown H5850 of glory H8597, [if] it be found H4672 (8735) in the way H1870 of righteousness H6666.
016:032 [He that is] slow H0750 to anger H0639 [is] better H2896 than the mighty H1368; and he that ruleth H4910 (8802) his spirit H7307 than he that taketh H3920 (8802) a city H5892.
016:033 The lot H1486 is cast H2904 (8714) into the lap H2436; but the whole disposing H4941 thereof [is] of the LORD H3068.
017:001 ¶ Better H2896 [is] a dry H2720 morsel H6595, and quietness H7962 therewith, than an house H1004 full H4392 of sacrifices H2077 [with] strife H7379.
017:002 A wise H7919 (8688) servant H5650 shall have rule H4910 (8799) over a son H1121 that causeth shame H0954 (8688), and shall have part H2505 (8799) of the inheritance H5159 among H8432 the brethren H0251.
017:003 The fining pot H4715 [is] for silver H3701, and the furnace H3564 for gold H2091: but the LORD H3068 trieth H0974 (8802) the hearts H3826.
017:004 A wicked doer H7489 (8688) giveth heed H7181 (8688) to false H0205 lips H8193; [and] a liar H8267 giveth ear H0238 (8688) to a naughty H1942 tongue H3956.
017:005 Whoso mocketh H3932 (8802) the poor H7326 (8802) reproacheth H2778 (8765) his Maker H6213 (8802): [and] he that is glad H8056 at calamities H0343 shall not be unpunished H5352 (8735).
017:006 Children’s H1121 children H1121 [are] the crown H5850 of old men H2205; and the glory H8597 of children H1121 [are] their fathers H0001.
017:007 Excellent H3499 speech H8193 becometh H5000 not a fool H5036: much less do lying H8267 lips H8193 a prince H5081.
017:008 A gift H7810 [is as] a precious H2580 stone H0068 in the eyes H5869 of him that hath H1167 it: whithersoever it turneth H6437 (8799), it prospereth H7919 (8686).
017:009 He that covereth H3680 (8764) a transgression H6588 seeketh H1245 (8764) love H0160; but he that repeateth H8138 (8802) a matter H1697 separateth H6504 (8688) [very] friends H0441.
017:010 A reproof H1606 entereth H5181 (8799) more into a wise man H0995 (8688) than an hundred H3967 stripes H5221 (8687) into a fool H3684.
017:011 An evil H7451 [man] seeketh H1245 (8762) only rebellion H4805: therefore a cruel H0394 messenger H4397 shall be sent H7971 (8792) against him.
017:012 Let a bear H1677 robbed H7909 of her whelps meet H6298 (8800) a man H0376, rather than H0408 a fool H3684 in his folly H0200.
017:013 Whoso rewardeth H7725 (8688) evil H7451 for good H2896, evil H7451 shall not depart H4185 (8799) (8675) H4185 (8686) from his house H1004.
017:014 The beginning H7225 of strife H4066 [is as] when one letteth out H6362 (8802) water H4325: therefore leave off H5203 (8800) contention H7379, before H6440 it be meddled H1566 (8694) with.
017:015 He that justifieth H6663 (8688) the wicked H7563, and he that condemneth H7561 (8688) the just H6662, even they both H8147 [are] abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068.
017:016 Wherefore [is there] a price H4242 in the hand H3027 of a fool H3684 to get H7069 (8800) wisdom H2451, seeing [he hath] no heart H3820 [to it]?
017:017 A friend H7453 loveth H0157 (8802) at all times H6256, and a brother H0251 is born H3205 (8735) for adversity H6869.
017:018 A man H0120 void H2638 of understanding H3820 striketh H8628 (8802) hands H3709, [and] becometh H6148 (8802) surety H6161 in the presence H6440 of his friend H7453.
017:019 He loveth H0157 (8802) transgression H6588 that loveth H0157 (8802) strife H4683: [and] he that exalteth H1361 (8688) his gate H6607 seeketh H1245 (8764) destruction H7667.
017:020 He that hath a froward H6141 heart H3820 findeth H4672 (8799) no good H2896: and he that hath a perverse H2015 (8738) tongue H3956 falleth H5307 (8799) into mischief H7451.
017:021 He that begetteth H3205 (8802) a fool H3684 [doeth it] to his sorrow H8424: and the father H0001 of a fool H5036 hath no joy H8055 (8799).
017:022 A merry H8056 heart H3820 doeth good H3190 (8686) [like] a medicine H1456: but a broken H5218 spirit H7307 drieth H3001 (8762) the bones H1634.
017:023 A wicked H7563 [man] taketh H3947 (8799) a gift H7810 out of the bosom H2436 to pervert H5186 (8687) the ways H0734 of judgment H4941.
017:024 Wisdom H2451 [is] before him that hath understanding H6440 H0995 (8688); but the eyes H5869 of a fool H3684 [are] in the ends H7097 of the earth H0776.
017:025 A foolish H3684 son H1121 [is] a grief H3708 to his father H0001, and bitterness H4470 to her that bare H3205 (8802) him.
017:026 Also to punish H6064 (8800) the just H6662 [is] not good H2896, [nor] to strike H5221 (8687) princes H5081 for equity H3476.
017:027 He that hath H3045 (8802) knowledge H1847 spareth H2820 (8802) his words H0561: [and] a man H0376 of understanding H8394 is of an excellent H3368 (8675) H7119 spirit H7307.
017:028 Even a fool H0191, when he holdeth his peace H2790 (8688), is counted H2803 (8735) wise H2450: [and] he that shutteth H0331 (8801) his lips H8193 [is esteemed] a man of understanding H0995 (8737).
018:001 ¶ Through desire H8378 a man, having separated H6504 (8737) himself, seeketh H1245 (8762) [and] intermeddleth H1566 (8691) with all wisdom H8454.
018:002 A fool H3684 hath no delight H2654 (8799) in understanding H8394, but that his heart H3820 may discover H1540 (8692) itself.
018:003 When the wicked H7563 cometh H0935 (8800), [then] cometh H0935 (8804) also contempt H0937, and with ignominy H7036 reproach H2781.
018:004 The words H1697 of a man’s H0376 mouth H6310 [are as] deep H6013 waters H4325, [and] the wellspring H4726 of wisdom H2451 [as] a flowing H5042 (8802) brook H5158.
018:005 [It is] not good H2896 to accept H5375 (8800) the person H6440 of the wicked H7563, to overthrow H5186 (8687) the righteous H6662 in judgment H4941.
018:006 A fool’s H3684 lips H8193 enter H0935 (8799) into contention H7379, and his mouth H6310 calleth H7121 (8799) for strokes H4112.
018:007 A fool’s H3684 mouth H6310 [is] his destruction H4288, and his lips H8193 [are] the snare H4170 of his soul H5315.
018:008 The words H1697 of a talebearer H5372 [are] as wounds H3859 (8693), and they go down H3381 (8804) into the innermost parts H2315 of the belly H0990.
018:009 He also that is slothful H7503 (8693) in his work H4399 is brother H0251 to him that is a great H1167 waster H7843 (8688).
018:010 The name H8034 of the LORD H3068 [is] a strong H5797 tower H4026: the righteous H6662 runneth H7323 (8799) into it, and is safe H7682 (8738).
018:011 The rich man’s H6223 wealth H1952 [is] his strong H5797 city H7151, and as an high H7682 (8737) wall H2346 in his own conceit H4906.
018:012 Before H6440 destruction H7667 the heart H3820 of man H0376 is haughty H1361 (8799), and before H6440 honour H3519 [is] humility H6038.
018:013 He that answereth H7725 (8688) a matter H1697 before he heareth H8085 (8799) [it], it [is] folly H0200 and shame H3639 unto him.
018:014 The spirit H7307 of a man H0376 will sustain H3557 (8770) his infirmity H4245; but a wounded H5218 spirit H7307 who can bear H5375 (8799)?
018:015 The heart H3820 of the prudent H0995 (8737) getteth H7069 (8799) knowledge H1847; and the ear H0241 of the wise H2450 seeketh H1245 (8762) knowledge H1847.
018:016 A man’s H0120 gift H4976 maketh room H7337 (8686) for him, and bringeth H5148 (8686) him before H6440 great men H1419.
018:017 [He that is] first H7223 in his own cause H7379 [seemeth] just H6662; but his neighbour H7453 cometh H0935 (8804) (8675) H0935 (8799) and searcheth H2713 (8804) him.
018:018 The lot H1486 causeth contentions H4079 to cease H7673 (8686), and parteth H6504 (8686) between the mighty H6099.
018:019 A brother H0251 offended H6586 (8737) [is harder to be won] than a strong H5797 city H7151: and [their] contentions H4079 (8675) H4066 [are] like the bars H1280 of a castle H0759.
018:020 A man’s H0376 belly H0990 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) with the fruit H6529 of his mouth H6310; [and] with the increase H8393 of his lips H8193 shall he be filled H7646 (8799).
018:021 Death H4194 and life H2416 [are] in the power H3027 of the tongue H3956: and they that love H0157 (8802) it shall eat H0398 (8799) the fruit H6529 thereof.
018:022 [Whoso] findeth H4672 (8804) a wife H0802 findeth H4672 (8804) a good H2896 [thing], and obtaineth H6329 (8686) favour H7522 of the LORD H3068.
018:023 The poor H7326 (8802) useth H1696 (8762) intreaties H8469; but the rich H6223 answereth H6030 (8799) roughly H5794.
018:024 A man H0376 [that hath] friends H7453 must shew himself friendly H7489 (8710): and there is H3426 a friend H0157 (8802) [that] sticketh closer H1695 than a brother H0251.
019:001 ¶ Better H2896 [is] the poor H7326 (8802) that walketh H1980 (8802) in his integrity H8537, than [he that is] perverse H6141 in his lips H8193, and is a fool H3684.
019:002 Also, [that] the soul H5315 [be] without knowledge H1847, [it is] not good H2896; and he that hasteth H0213 (8801) with [his] feet H7272 sinneth H2398 (8802).
019:003 The foolishness H0200 of man H0120 perverteth H5557 (8762) his way H1870: and his heart H3820 fretteth H2196 (8799) against the LORD H3068.
019:004 Wealth H1952 maketh H3254 (8686) many H7227 friends H7453; but the poor H1800 is separated H6504 (8735) from his neighbour H7453.
019:005 A false H8267 witness H5707 shall not be unpunished H5352 (8735), and [he that] speaketh H6315 (8686) lies H3577 shall not escape H4422 (8735).
019:006 Many H7227 will intreat H2470 (8762) the favour H6440 of the prince H5081: and every man [is] a friend H7453 to him H0376 that giveth gifts H4976.
019:007 All the brethren H0251 of the poor H7326 (8802) do hate H8130 (8804) him: how much more do his friends H4828 go far H7368 (8804) from him? he pursueth H7291 (8764) [them with] words H0561, [yet] they [are] wanting [to him].
019:008 He that getteth H7069 (8802) wisdom H3820 loveth H0157 (8802) his own soul H5315: he that keepeth H8104 (8802) understanding H8394 shall find H4672 (8800) good H2896.
019:009 A false H8267 witness H5707 shall not be unpunished H5352 (8735), and [he that] speaketh H6315 (8686) lies H3577 shall perish H0006 (8799).
019:010 Delight H8588 is not seemly H5000 for a fool H3684; much less for a servant H5650 to have rule H4910 (8800) over princes H8269.
019:011 The discretion H7922 of a man H0120 deferreth H0748 (8689) his anger H0639; and [it is] his glory H8597 to pass over H5674 (8800) a transgression H6588.
019:012 The king’s H4428 wrath H2197 [is] as the roaring H5099 of a lion H3715; but his favour H7522 [is] as dew H2919 upon the grass H6212.
019:013 A foolish H3684 son H1121 [is] the calamity H1942 of his father H0001: and the contentions H4079 of a wife H0802 [are] a continual H2956 (8802) dropping H1812.
019:014 House H1004 and riches H1952 [are] the inheritance H5159 of fathers H0001: and a prudent H7919 (8688) wife H0802 [is] from the LORD H3068.
019:015 Slothfulness H6103 casteth H5307 (8686) into a deep sleep H8639; and an idle H7423 soul H5315 shall suffer hunger H7456 (8799).
019:016 He that keepeth H8104 (8802) the commandment H4687 keepeth H8104 (8802) his own soul H5315; [but] he that despiseth H0959 (8802) his ways H1870 shall die H4191 (8799).
019:017 He that hath pity H2603 (8802) upon the poor H1800 lendeth H3867 (8688) unto the LORD H3068; and that which he hath given H1576 will he pay him again H7999 (8762).
019:018 Chasten H3256 (8761) thy son H1121 while there is H3426 hope H8615, and let not thy soul H5315 spare H5375 (8799) for his crying H4191 (8687).
019:019 A man H1419 of great H1632 wrath H2534 shall suffer H5375 (8802) punishment H6066: for if thou deliver H5337 (8686) [him], yet thou must do it again H3254 (8686).
019:020 Hear H8085 (8798) counsel H6098, and receive H6901 (8761) instruction H4148, that thou mayest be wise H2449 (8799) in thy latter end H0319.
019:021 [There are] many H7227 devices H4284 in a man’s H0376 heart H3820; nevertheless the counsel H6098 of the LORD H3068, that shall stand H6965 (8799).
019:022 The desire H8378 of a man H0120 [is] his kindness H2617: and a poor man H7326 (8802) [is] better H2896 than H0376 a liar H3577.
019:023 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [tendeth] to life H2416: and [he that hath it] shall abide H3885 (8799) satisfied H7649; he shall not be visited H6485 (8735) with evil H7451.
019:024 A slothful H6102 [man] hideth H2934 (8804) his hand H3027 in [his] bosom H6747, and will not so much as bring H7725 it to his mouth H6310 again H7725 (8686).
019:025 Smite H5221 (8686) a scorner H3887 (8801), and the simple H6612 will beware H6191 (8686): and reprove H3198 (8689) one that hath understanding H0995 (8737), [and] he will understand H0995 (8799) knowledge H1847.
019:026 He that wasteth H7703 (8764) [his] father H0001, [and] chaseth away H1272 (8686) [his] mother H0517, [is] a son H1121 that causeth shame H0954 (8688), and bringeth reproach H2659 (8688).
019:027 Cease H2308 (8798), my son H1121, to hear H8085 (8800) the instruction H4148 [that causeth] to err H7686 (8800) from the words H0561 of knowledge H1847.
019:028 An ungodly H1100 witness H5707 scorneth H3887 (8686) judgment H4941: and the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563 devoureth H1104 (8762) iniquity H0205.
019:029 Judgments H8201 are prepared H3559 (8738) for scorners H3887 (8801), and stripes H4112 for the back H1460 of fools H3684.
020:001 ¶ Wine H3196 [is] a mocker H3887 (8801), strong drink H7941 [is] raging H1993 (8802): and whosoever is deceived H7686 (8802) thereby is not wise H2449 (8799).
020:002 The fear H0367 of a king H4428 [is] as the roaring H5099 of a lion H3715: [whoso] provoketh him to anger H5674 (8693) sinneth H2398 (8802) [against] his own soul H5315.
020:003 [It is] an honour H3519 for a man H0376 to cease H7674 from strife H7379: but every fool H0191 will be meddling H1566 (8691).
020:004 The sluggard H6102 will not plow H2790 (8799) by reason of the cold H2779; [therefore] shall he beg H7592 (8804) (8675) H7592 (8799) in harvest H7105, and [have] nothing.
020:005 Counsel H6098 in the heart H3820 of man H0376 [is like] deep H6013 water H4325; but a man H0376 of understanding H8394 will draw it out H1802 (8799).
020:006 Most H7230 men H0120 will proclaim H7121 (8799) every one H0376 his own goodness H2617: but a faithful H0529 man H0376 who can find H4672 (8799)?
020:007 The just H6662 [man] walketh H1980 (8693) in his integrity H8537: his children H1121 [are] blessed H0835 after H0310 him.
020:008 A king H4428 that sitteth in H3427 (8802) the throne H3678 of judgment H1779 scattereth away H2219 (8764) all evil H7451 with his eyes H5869.
020:009 Who can say H0559 (8799), I have made my heart H3820 clean H2135 (8765), I am pure H2891 (8804) from my sin H2403?
020:010 Divers weights H0068 H0068, [and] divers measures H0374 H0374, both H8147 of them [are] alike H1571 abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068.
020:011 Even a child H5288 is known H5234 (8691) by his doings H4611, whether his work H6467 [be] pure H2134, and whether [it be] right H3477.
020:012 The hearing H8085 (8802) ear H0241, and the seeing H7200 (8802) eye H5869, the LORD H3068 hath made H6213 (8804) even both H8147 of them.
020:013 Love H0157 (8799) not sleep H8142, lest thou come to poverty H3423 (8735); open H6491 (8798) thine eyes H5869, [and] thou shalt be satisfied H7646 (8798) with bread H3899.
020:014 [It is] naught H7451, [it is] naught H7451, saith H0559 (8799) the buyer H7069 (8802): but when he is gone H0235 (8801) his way, then he boasteth H1984 (8691).
020:015 There is H3426 gold H2091, and a multitude H7230 of rubies H6443: but the lips H8193 of knowledge H1847 [are] a precious H3366 jewel H3627.
020:016 Take H3947 (8798) his garment H0899 that is surety H6148 (8804) [for] a stranger H2114 (8801): and take a pledge H2254 (8798) of him for a strange woman H5237.
020:017 Bread H3899 of deceit H8267 [is] sweet H6156 to a man H0376; but afterwards H0310 his mouth H6310 shall be filled H4390 (8735) with gravel H2687.
020:018 [Every] purpose H4284 is established H3559 (8735) by counsel H6098: and with good advice H8458 make H6213 (8798) war H4421.
020:019 He that goeth about H1980 (8802) [as] a talebearer H7400 revealeth H1540 (8802) secrets H5475: therefore meddle H6148 (8691) not with him that flattereth H6601 (8802) with his lips H8193.
020:020 Whoso curseth H7043 (8764) his father H0001 or his mother H0517, his lamp H5216 shall be put out H1846 (8799) in obscure H0380 (8676) H0380 darkness H2822.
020:021 An inheritance H5159 [may be] gotten hastily H0926 (8794) (8675) H0973 (8794) at the beginning H7223; but the end H0319 thereof shall not be blessed H1288 (8792).
020:022 Say H0559 (8799) not thou, I will recompense H7999 (8762) evil H7451; [but] wait on H6960 (8761) the LORD H3068, and he shall save H3467 (8686) thee.
020:023 Divers weights H0068 H0068 [are] an abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068; and a false H4820 balance H3976 [is] not good H2896.
020:024 Man’s H1397 goings H4703 [are] of the LORD H3068; how can a man H0120 then understand H0995 (8799) his own way H1870?
020:025 [It is] a snare H4170 to the man H0120 [who] devoureth H3216 (8804) [that which is] holy H6944, and after H0310 vows H5088 to make enquiry H1239 (8763).
020:026 A wise H2450 king H4428 scattereth H2219 (8764) the wicked H7563, and bringeth H7725 (8686) the wheel H0212 over them.
020:027 The spirit H5397 of man H0120 [is] the candle H5216 of the LORD H3068, searching H2664 (8802) all the inward parts H2315 of the belly H0990.
020:028 Mercy H2617 and truth H0571 preserve H5341 (8799) the king H4428: and his throne H3678 is upholden H5582 (8804) by mercy H2617.
020:029 The glory H8597 of young men H0970 [is] their strength H3581: and the beauty H1926 of old men H2205 [is] the gray head H7872.
020:030 The blueness H2250 of a wound H6482 cleanseth H8562 away evil H7451: so [do] stripes H4347 the inward parts H2315 of the belly H0990.
021:001 ¶ The king’s H4428 heart H3820 [is] in the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068, [as] the rivers H6388 of water H4325: he turneth H5186 (8686) it whithersoever he will H2654 (8799).
021:002 Every way H1870 of a man H0376 [is] right H3477 in his own eyes H5869: but the LORD H3068 pondereth H8505 (8802) the hearts H3826.
021:003 To do H6213 (8800) justice H6666 and judgment H4941 [is] more acceptable H0977 (8737) to the LORD H3068 than sacrifice H2077.
021:004 An high H7312 look H5869, and a proud H7342 heart H3820, [and] the plowing H5215 of the wicked H7563, [is] sin H2403.
021:005 The thoughts H4284 of the diligent H2742 [tend] only to plenteousness H4195; but of every one [that is] hasty H0213 (8801) only to want H4270.
021:006 The getting H6467 of treasures H0214 by a lying H8267 tongue H3956 [is] a vanity H1892 tossed to and fro of H5086 (8737) them that seek H1245 (8764) death H4194.
021:007 The robbery H7701 of the wicked H7563 shall destroy H1641 (8799) them; because they refuse H3985 (8765) to do H6213 (8800) judgment H4941.
021:008 The way H1870 of man H0376 [is] froward H2019 and strange H2054: but [as for] the pure H2134, his work H6467 [is] right H3477.
021:009 [It is] better H2896 to dwell H3427 (8800) in a corner H6438 of the housetop H1406, than with a brawling H4079 (8675) H4066 woman H0802 in a wide H2267 house H1004.
021:010 The soul H5315 of the wicked H7563 desireth H0183 (8765) evil H7451: his neighbour H7453 findeth no favour H2603 (8717) in his eyes H5869.
021:011 When the scorner H3887 (8801) is punished H6064 (8800), the simple H6612 is made wise H2449 (8799): and when the wise H2450 is instructed H7919 (8687), he receiveth H3947 (8799) knowledge H1847.
021:012 The righteous H6662 [man] wisely considereth H7919 (8688) the house H1004 of the wicked H7563: [but God] overthroweth H5557 (8764) the wicked H7563 for [their] wickedness H7451.
021:013 Whoso stoppeth H0331 (8801) his ears H0241 at the cry H2201 of the poor H1800, he also shall cry H7121 (8799) himself, but shall not be heard H6030 (8735).
021:014 A gift H4976 in secret H5643 pacifieth H3711 (8799) anger H0639: and a reward H7810 in the bosom H2436 strong H5794 wrath H2534.
021:015 [It is] joy H8057 to the just H6662 to do H6213 (8800) judgment H4941: but destruction H4288 [shall be] to the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205.
021:016 The man H0120 that wandereth H8582 (8802) out of the way H1870 of understanding H7919 (8687) shall remain H5117 (8799) in the congregation H6951 of the dead H7496.
021:017 He that loveth H0157 (8802) pleasure H8057 [shall be] a poor H4270 man H0376: he that loveth H0157 (8802) wine H3196 and oil H8081 shall not be rich H6238 (8686).
021:018 The wicked H7563 [shall be] a ransom H3724 for the righteous H6662, and the transgressor H0898 (8802) for the upright H3477.
021:019 [It is] better H2896 to dwell H3427 (8800) in the wilderness H0776 H4057, than with a contentious H4079 (8675) H4066 and an angry H3708 woman H0802.
021:020 [There is] treasure H0214 to be desired H2530 (8737) and oil H8081 in the dwelling H5116 of the wise H2450; but a foolish H3684 man H0120 spendeth it up H1104 (8762).
021:021 He that followeth H7291 (8802) after righteousness H6666 and mercy H2617 findeth H4672 (8799) life H2416, righteousness H6666, and honour H3519.
021:022 A wise H2450 [man] scaleth H5927 (8804) the city H5892 of the mighty H1368, and casteth down H3381 (8686) the strength H5797 of the confidence H4009 thereof.
021:023 Whoso keepeth H8104 (8802) his mouth H6310 and his tongue H3956 keepeth H8104 (8802) his soul H5315 from troubles H6869.
021:024 Proud H2086 [and] haughty H3093 scorner H3887 (8801) [is] his name H8034, who dealeth H6213 (8802) in proud H2087 wrath H5678.
021:025 The desire H8378 of the slothful H6102 killeth H4191 (8686) him; for his hands H3027 refuse H3985 (8765) to labour H6213 (8800).
021:026 He coveteth H0183 (8694) greedily H8378 all the day H3117 long: but the righteous H6662 giveth H5414 (8799) and spareth H2820 (8799) not.
021:027 The sacrifice H2077 of the wicked H7563 [is] abomination H8441: how much more, [when] he bringeth H0935 (8686) it with a wicked mind H2154?
021:028 A false H3577 witness H5707 shall perish H0006 (8799): but the man H0376 that heareth H8085 (8802) speaketh H1696 (8762) constantly H5331.
021:029 A wicked H7563 man H0376 hardeneth H5810 (8689) his face H6440: but [as for] the upright H3477, he directeth H0995 (8799) (8675) H3559 (8686) his way H1870.
021:030 [There is] no wisdom H2451 nor understanding H8394 nor counsel H6098 against the LORD H3068.
021:031 The horse H5483 [is] prepared H3559 (8716) against the day H3117 of battle H4421: but safety H8668 [is] of the LORD H3068.
022:001 ¶ A [good] name H8034 [is] rather to be chosen H0977 (8737) than great H7227 riches H6239, [and] loving H2896 favour H2580 rather than silver H3701 and gold H2091.
022:002 The rich H6223 and poor H7326 (8802) meet together H6298 (8738): the LORD H3068 [is] the maker H6213 (8802) of them all.
022:003 A prudent H6175 [man] foreseeth H7200 (8804) the evil H7451, and hideth H5641 (8738) (8675) H5641 (8799) himself: but the simple H6612 pass on H5674 (8804), and are punished H6064 (8738).
022:004 By H6118 humility H6038 [and] the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [are] riches H6239, and honour H3519, and life H2416.
022:005 Thorns H6791 [and] snares H6341 [are] in the way H1870 of the froward H6141: he that doth keep H8104 (8802) his soul H5315 shall be far H7368 (8799) from them.
022:006 Train up H2596 (8798) a child H5288 in the way H1870 he should go H6310: and when he is old H2204 (8686), he will not depart H5493 (8799) from it.
022:007 The rich H6223 ruleth H4910 (8799) over the poor H7326 (8802), and the borrower H3867 (8801) [is] servant H5650 to the lender H0376 H3867 (8688).
022:008 He that soweth H2232 (8802) iniquity H5766 shall reap H7114 (8799) vanity H0205: and the rod H7626 of his anger H5678 shall fail H3615 (8799).
022:009 He that hath a bountiful H2896 eye H5869 shall be blessed H1288 (8792); for he giveth H5414 (8804) of his bread H3899 to the poor H1800.
022:010 Cast out H1644 (8763) the scorner H3887 (8801), and contention H4066 shall go out H3318 (8799); yea, strife H1779 and reproach H7036 shall cease H7673 (8799).
022:011 He that loveth H0157 (8802) pureness H2890 (8675) H2889 of heart H3820, [for] the grace H2580 of his lips H8193 the king H4428 [shall be] his friend H7453.
022:012 The eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 preserve H5341 (8804) knowledge H1847, and he overthroweth H5557 (8762) the words H1697 of the transgressor H0898 (8802).
022:013 The slothful H6102 [man] saith H0559 (8804), [There is] a lion H0738 without H2351, I shall be slain H7523 (8735) in H8432 the streets H7339.
022:014 The mouth H6310 of strange women H2114 (8801) [is] a deep H6013 pit H7745: he that is abhorred H2194 (8803) of the LORD H3068 shall fall H5307 (8799) therein.
022:015 Foolishness H0200 [is] bound H7194 (8803) in the heart H3820 of a child H5288; [but] the rod H7626 of correction H4148 shall drive it far H7368 (8686) from him.
022:016 He that oppresseth H6231 (8802) the poor H1800 to increase H7235 (8687) his [riches, and] he that giveth H5414 (8802) to the rich H6223, [shall] surely [come] to want H4270.
022:017 Bow down H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241, and hear H8085 (8798) the words H1697 of the wise H2450, and apply H7896 (8799) thine heart H3820 unto my knowledge H1847.
022:018 For [it is] a pleasant thing H5273 if thou keep H8104 (8799) them within H0990 thee; they shall withal H3162 be fitted H3559 (8735) in thy lips H8193.
022:019 That thy trust H4009 may be in the LORD H3068, I have made known H3045 (8689) to thee this day H3117, even to thee.
022:020 Have not I written H3789 (8804) to thee H8032 excellent things H7991 in counsels H4156 and knowledge H1847,
022:021 That I might make thee know H3045 (8687) the certainty H7189 of the words H0561 of truth H0571; that thou mightest answer H7725 (8687) the words H0561 of truth H0571 to them that send H7971 (8802) unto thee?
022:022 Rob H1497 (8799) not the poor H1800, because he [is] poor H1800: neither oppress H1792 (8762) the afflicted H6041 in the gate H8179:
022:023 For the LORD H3068 will plead H7378 (8799) their cause H7379, and spoil H6906 (8804) the soul H5315 of those that spoiled H6906 (8802) them.
022:024 Make no friendship H7462 (8691) with an angry H0639 man H1167; and with a furious H2534 man H0376 thou shalt not go H0935 (8799):
022:025 Lest thou learn H0502 (8799) his ways H0734, and get H3947 (8804) a snare H4170 to thy soul H5315.
022:026 Be not thou [one] of them that strike H8628 (8802) hands H3709, [or] of them that are sureties H6148 (8802) for debts H4859.
022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay H7999 (8763), why should he take away H3947 (8799) thy bed H4904 from under thee?
022:028 Remove H5253 (8686) not the ancient H5769 landmark H1366, which thy fathers H0001 have set H6213 (8804).
022:029 Seest H2372 (8804) thou a man H0376 diligent H4106 in his business H4399? he shall stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 kings H4428; he shall not stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 mean H2823 [men].
023:001 ¶ When thou sittest H3427 (8799) to eat H3898 (8800) with a ruler H4910 (8802), consider H0995 (8799) diligently H0995 (8800) what [is] before H6440 thee:
023:002 And put H7760 (8804) a knife H7915 to thy throat H3930, if thou [be] a man given H1167 to appetite H5315.
023:003 Be not desirous H0183 (8691) of his dainties H4303: for they [are] deceitful H3577 meat H3899.
023:004 Labour H3021 (8799) not to be rich H6238 (8687): cease H2308 (8798) from thine own wisdom H0998.
023:005 Wilt thou set H5774 (8686) (8675) H5774 (8799) thine eyes H5869 upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly H6213 (8800) make H6213 (8799) themselves wings H3671; they fly away H5774 (8799) (8675) H5774 (8687) as an eagle H5404 toward heaven H8064.
023:006 Eat H3898 (8799) thou not the bread H3899 of [him that hath] an evil H7451 eye H5869, neither desire H0183 (8691) thou his dainty meats H4303:
023:007 For as he thinketh H8176 (8804) in his heart H5315, so [is] he: Eat H0398 (8798) and drink H8354 (8798), saith H0559 (8799) he to thee; but his heart H3820 [is] not with thee.
023:008 The morsel H6595 [which] thou hast eaten H0398 (8804) shalt thou vomit up H6958 (8686), and lose H7843 (8765) thy sweet H5273 words H1697.
023:009 Speak H1696 (8762) not in the ears H0241 of a fool H3684: for he will despise H0936 (8799) the wisdom H7922 of thy words H4405.
023:010 Remove H5253 (8686) not the old H5769 landmark H1366; and enter H0935 (8799) not into the fields H7704 of the fatherless H3490:
023:011 For their redeemer H1350 (8802) [is] mighty H2389; he shall plead H7378 (8799) their cause H7379 with thee.
023:012 Apply H0935 (8685) thine heart H3820 unto instruction H4148, and thine ears H0241 to the words H0561 of knowledge H1847.
023:013 Withhold H4513 (8799) not correction H4148 from the child H5288: for [if] thou beatest H5221 (8686) him with the rod H7626, he shall not die H4191 (8799).
023:014 Thou shalt beat H5221 (8686) him with the rod H7626, and shalt deliver H5337 (8686) his soul H5315 from hell H7585.
023:015 My son H1121, if thine heart H3820 be wise H2449 (8804), my heart H3820 shall rejoice H8055 (8799), even mine H0589.
023:016 Yea, my reins H3629 shall rejoice H5937 (8799), when thy lips H8193 speak H1696 (8763) right things H4339.
023:017 Let not thine heart H3820 envy H7065 (8762) sinners H2400: but [be thou] in the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 all the day H3117 long.
023:018 For surely there is H3426 an end H0319; and thine expectation H8615 shall not be cut off H3772 (8735).
023:019 Hear H8085 (8798) thou, my son H1121, and be wise H2449 (8798), and guide H0833 (8761) thine heart H3820 in the way H1870.
023:020 Be not among winebibbers H3196 H5433 (8802); among riotous eaters H2151 (8802) of flesh H1320:
023:021 For the drunkard H5433 (8802) and the glutton H2151 (8802) shall come to poverty H3423 (8735): and drowsiness H5124 shall clothe H3847 (8686) [a man] with rags H7168.
023:022 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto thy father H0001 that begat H3205 (8804) thee, and despise H0936 (8799) not thy mother H0517 when she is old H2204 (8804).
023:023 Buy H7069 (8798) the truth H0571, and sell H4376 (8799) [it] not; [also] wisdom H2451, and instruction H4148, and understanding H0998.
023:024 The father H0001 of the righteous H6662 shall greatly H1524 rejoice H1523 (8799): and he that begetteth H3205 (8802) a wise H2450 [child] shall have joy H8055 (8799) of him.
023:025 Thy father H0001 and thy mother H0517 shall be glad H8055 (8799), and she that bare H3205 (8802) thee shall rejoice H1523 (8799).
023:026 My son H1121, give H5414 (8798) me thine heart H3820, and let thine eyes H5869 observe H7521 (8799) H5341 (8799) my ways H1870.
023:027 For a whore H2181 (8802) [is] a deep H6013 ditch H7745; and a strange woman H5237 [is] a narrow H6862 pit H0875.
023:028 She also lieth in wait H0693 (8799) as [for] a prey H2863, and increaseth H3254 (8686) the transgressors H0898 (8802) among men H0120.
023:029 Who hath woe H0188? who hath sorrow H0017? who hath contentions H4079 (8675) H4066? who hath babbling H7879? who hath wounds H6482 without cause H2600? who hath redness H2448 of eyes H5869?
023:030 They that tarry long H0309 (8764) at the wine H3196; they that go H0935 (8802) to seek H2713 (8800) mixed wine H4469.
023:031 Look H7200 (8799) not thou upon the wine H3196 when it is red H0119 (8691), when it giveth H5414 (8799) his colour H5869 in the cup H3563 (8675) H3599, [when] it moveth H1980 (8691) itself aright H4339.
023:032 At the last H0319 it biteth H5391 (8799) like a serpent H5175, and stingeth H6567 (8686) like an adder H6848.
023:033 Thine eyes H5869 shall behold H7200 (8799) strange women H2114 (8801), and thine heart H3820 shall utter H1696 (8762) perverse things H8419.
023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down H7901 (8802) in the midst H3820 of the sea H3220, or as he that lieth H7901 (8802) upon the top H7218 of a mast H2260.
023:035 They have stricken H5221 (8689) me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick H2470 (8804); they have beaten H1986 (8804) me, [and] I felt H3045 (8804) [it] not: when shall I awake H6974 (8686)? I will seek H1245 (8762) it yet H3254 (8686) again.
024:001 ¶ Be not thou envious H7065 (8762) against evil H7451 men H0582, neither desire H0183 (8691) to be with them.
024:002 For their heart H3820 studieth H1897 (8799) destruction H7701, and their lips H8193 talk H1696 (8762) of mischief H5999.
024:003 Through wisdom H2451 is an house H1004 builded H1129 (8735); and by understanding H8394 it is established H3559 (8709):
024:004 And by knowledge H1847 shall the chambers H2315 be filled H4390 (8735) with all precious H3368 and pleasant H5273 riches H1952.
024:005 A wise H2450 man H1397 [is] strong H5797; yea, a man H0376 of knowledge H1847 increaseth H0553 (8764) strength H3581.
024:006 For by wise counsel H8458 thou shalt make H6213 (8799) thy war H4421: and in multitude H7230 of counsellors H3289 (8802) [there is] safety H8668.
024:007 Wisdom H2454 [is] too high H7311 (8802) for a fool H0191: he openeth H6605 (8799) not his mouth H6310 in the gate H8179.
024:008 He that deviseth H2803 (8764) to do evil H7489 (8687) shall be called H7121 (8799) a mischievous H4209 person H1167.
024:009 The thought H2154 of foolishness H0200 [is] sin H2403: and the scorner H3887 (8801) [is] an abomination H8441 to men H0120.
024:010 [If] thou faint H7503 (8694) in the day H3117 of adversity H6869, thy strength H3581 [is] small H6862.
024:011 If thou forbear H2820 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8685) [them that are] drawn H3947 (8803) unto death H4194, and [those that are] ready H4131 (8801) to be slain H2027;
024:012 If thou sayest H0559 (8799), Behold, we knew H3045 (8804) it not; doth not he that pondereth H8505 (8802) the heart H3826 consider H0995 (8799) [it]? and he that keepeth H5341 (8802) thy soul H5315, doth [not] he know H3045 (8799) [it]? and shall [not] he render H7725 (8689) to [every] man H0120 according to his works H6467?
024:013 My son H1121, eat H0398 (8798) thou honey H1706, because [it is] good H2896; and the honeycomb H5317, [which is] sweet H4966 to thy taste H2441:
024:014 So [shall] the knowledge H3045 (8798) of wisdom H2451 [be] unto thy soul H5315: when thou hast found H4672 (8804) [it], then there shall be H3426 a reward H0319, and thy expectation H8615 shall not be cut off H3772 (8735).
024:015 Lay not wait H0693 (8799), O wicked H7563 [man], against the dwelling H5116 of the righteous H6662; spoil H7703 (8762) not his resting place H7258:
024:016 For a just H6662 [man] falleth H5307 (8799) seven times H7651, and riseth up again H6965 (8804): but the wicked H7563 shall fall H3782 (8735) into mischief H7451.
024:017 Rejoice H8055 (8799) not when thine enemy H0341 (8802) falleth H5307 (8800), and let not thine heart H3820 be glad H1523 (8799) when he stumbleth H3782 (8736):
024:018 Lest the LORD H3068 see H7200 (8799) [it], and it displease H7489 (8804) H5869 him, and he turn away H7725 (8689) his wrath H0639 from him.
024:019 Fret H2734 (8691) not thyself because of evil H7489 (8688) [men], neither be thou envious H7065 (8762) at the wicked H7563;
024:020 For there shall be no reward H0319 to the evil H7451 [man]; the candle H5216 of the wicked H7563 shall be put out H1846 (8799).
024:021 My son H1121, fear H3372 (8798) thou the LORD H3068 and the king H4428: [and] meddle H6148 (8691) not with them that are given to change H8138 (8802):
024:022 For their calamity H0343 shall rise H6965 (8799) suddenly H6597; and who knoweth H3045 (8802) the ruin H6365 of them both H8147?
024:023 These [things] also [belong] to the wise H2450. [It is] not good H2896 to have respect H5234 (8687) of persons H6440 in judgment H4941.
024:024 He that saith H0559 (8802) unto the wicked H7563, Thou [art] righteous H6662; him shall the people H5971 curse H5344 (8799), nations H3816 shall abhor H2194 (8799) him:
024:025 But to them that rebuke H3198 (8688) [him] shall be delight H5276 (8799), and a good H2896 blessing H1293 shall come H0935 (8799) upon them.
024:026 [Every man] shall kiss H5401 (8799) [his] lips H8193 that giveth H7725 (8688) a right H5228 answer H1697.
024:027 Prepare H3559 (8685) thy work H4399 without H2351, and make it fit H6257 (8761) for thyself in the field H7704; and afterwards H0310 build H1129 (8804) thine house H1004.
024:028 Be not a witness H5707 against thy neighbour H7453 without cause H2600; and deceive H6601 (8765) [not] with thy lips H8193.
024:029 Say H0559 (8799) not, I will do H6213 (8799) so to him as he hath done H6213 (8804) to me: I will render H7725 (8686) to the man H0376 according to his work H6467.
024:030 I went H5674 (8804) by the field H7704 of the slothful H0376 H6102, and by the vineyard H3754 of the man H0120 void H2638 of understanding H3820;
024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over H5927 (8804) with thorns H7063, [and] nettles H2738 had covered H3680 (8795) the face H6440 thereof, and the stone H0068 wall H1444 thereof was broken down H2040 (8738).
024:032 Then I saw H2372 (8799), [and] considered [it] well H7896 (8799) H3820: I looked H7200 (8804) upon [it, and] received H3947 (8804) instruction H4148.
024:033 [Yet] a little H4592 sleep H8142, a little H4592 slumber H8572, a little H4592 folding H2264 of the hands H3027 to sleep H7901 (8800):
024:034 So shall thy poverty H7389 come H0935 (8804) [as] one that travelleth H1980 (8693); and thy want H4270 as an armed H4043 man H0376.
025:001 ¶ These [are] also proverbs H4912 of Solomon H8010, which the men H0582 of Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 copied out H6275 (8689).
025:002 [It is] the glory H3519 of God H0430 to conceal H5641 (8687) a thing H1697: but the honour H3519 of kings H4428 [is] to search out H2713 (8800) a matter H1697.
025:003 The heaven H8064 for height H7312, and the earth H0776 for depth H6011, and the heart H3820 of kings H4428 [is] unsearchable H2714.
025:004 Take away H1898 (8800) the dross H5509 from the silver H3701, and there shall come forth H3318 (8799) a vessel H3627 for the finer H6884 (8802).
025:005 Take away H1898 (8800) the wicked H7563 [from] before H6440 the king H4428, and his throne H3678 shall be established H3559 (8735) in righteousness H6664.
025:006 Put not forth H1921 (8691) thyself in the presence H6440 of the king H4428, and stand H5975 (8799) not in the place H4725 of great H1419 [men]:
025:007 For better H2896 [it is] that it be said H0559 (8800) unto thee, Come up H5927 (8798) hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower H8213 (8687) in the presence H6440 of the prince H5081 whom thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804).
025:008 Go not forth H3318 (8799) hastily H4118 to strive H7378 (8800), lest [thou know not] what to do H6213 (8799) in the end H0319 thereof, when thy neighbour H7453 hath put thee to shame H3637 (8687).
025:009 Debate H7378 (8798) thy cause H7379 with thy neighbour H7453 [himself]; and discover H1540 (8762) not a secret H5475 to another H0312:
025:010 Lest he that heareth H8085 (8802) [it] put thee to shame H2616 (8762), and thine infamy H1681 turn not away H7725 (8799).
025:011 A word H1697 fitly H0212 (8675) H0655 spoken H1696 (8803) [is like] apples H8598 of gold H2091 in pictures H4906 of silver H3701.
025:012 [As] an earring H5141 of gold H2091, and an ornament H2481 of fine gold H3800, [so is] a wise H2450 reprover H3198 (8688) upon an obedient H8085 (8802) ear H0241.
025:013 As the cold H6793 of snow H7950 in the time H3117 of harvest H7105, [so is] a faithful H0539 (8737) messenger H6735 to them that send H7971 (8802) him: for he refresheth H7725 (8686) the soul H5315 of his masters H0113.
025:014 Whoso H0376 boasteth H1984 (8693) himself of a false H8267 gift H4991 [is like] clouds H5387 and wind H7307 without rain H1653.
025:015 By long H0753 forbearing H0639 is a prince H7101 persuaded H6601 (8792), and a soft H7390 tongue H3956 breaketh H7665 (8799) the bone H1634.
025:016 Hast thou found H4672 (8804) honey H1706? eat H0398 (8798) so much as is sufficient H1767 for thee, lest thou be filled H7646 (8799) therewith, and vomit H6958 (8689) it.
025:017 Withdraw H3365 (8685) thy foot H7272 from thy neighbour’s H7453 house H1004; lest he be weary H7646 (8799) of thee, and [so] hate H8130 (8804) thee.
025:018 A man H0376 that beareth H6030 (8802) false H8267 witness H5707 against his neighbour H7453 [is] a maul H4650, and a sword H2719, and a sharp H8150 (8802) arrow H2671.
025:019 Confidence H4009 in an unfaithful man H0898 (8802) in time H3117 of trouble H6869 [is like] a broken H7465 tooth H8127, and a foot H7272 out of joint H4154.
025:020 [As] he that taketh away H5710 (8688) a garment H0899 in cold H7135 weather H3117, [and as] vinegar H2558 upon nitre H5427, so [is] he that singeth H7891 (8802) songs H7892 to an heavy H7451 heart H3820.
025:021 If thine enemy H8130 (8802) be hungry H7457, give him bread H3899 to eat H0398 (8685); and if he be thirsty H6771, give him water H4325 to drink H8248 (8685):
025:022 For thou shalt heap H2846 (8802) coals of fire H1513 upon his head H7218, and the LORD H3068 shall reward H7999 (8762) thee.
025:023 The north H6828 wind H7307 driveth away H2342 (8787) rain H1653: so [doth] an angry H2194 (8737) countenance H6440 a backbiting H5643 tongue H3956.
025:024 [It is] better H2896 to dwell H3427 (8800) in the corner H6438 of the housetop H1406, than with a brawling H4079 (8675) H4066 woman H0802 and in a wide H2267 house H1004.
025:025 [As] cold H7119 waters H4325 to a thirsty H5889 soul H5315, so [is] good H2896 news H8052 from a far H4801 country H0776.
025:026 A righteous H6662 man falling down H4131 (8801) before H6440 the wicked H7563 [is as] a troubled H7515 (8737) fountain H4599, and a corrupt H7843 (8716) spring H4726.
025:027 [It is] not good H2896 to eat H0398 (8800) much H7235 (8687) honey H1706: so [for men] to search H2714 their own glory H3519 [is not] glory H3519.
025:028 He H0376 that [hath] no rule H4623 over his own spirit H7307 [is like] a city H5892 [that is] broken down H6555 (8803), [and] without walls H2346.
026:001 ¶ As snow H7950 in summer H7019, and as rain H4306 in harvest H7105, so honour H3519 is not seemly H5000 for a fool H3684.
026:002 As the bird H6833 by wandering H5110 (8800), as the swallow H1866 by flying H5774 (8800), so the curse H7045 causeless H2600 shall not come H0935 (8799).
026:003 A whip H7752 for the horse H5483, a bridle H4964 for the ass H2543, and a rod H7626 for the fool’s H3684 back H1460.
026:004 Answer H6030 (8799) not a fool H3684 according to his folly H0200, lest thou also be like H7737 (8799) unto him.
026:005 Answer H6030 (8798) a fool H3684 according to his folly H0200, lest he be wise H2450 in his own conceit H5869.
026:006 He that sendeth H7971 (8802) a message H1697 by the hand H3027 of a fool H3684 cutteth off H7096 (8764) the feet H7272, [and] drinketh H8354 (8802) damage H2555.
026:007 The legs H7785 of the lame H6455 are not equal H1809 (8804): so [is] a parable H4912 in the mouth H6310 of fools H3684.
026:008 As he that bindeth H6872 (8675) H6887 (8800) a stone H0068 in a sling H4773, so [is] he that giveth H5414 (8802) honour H3519 to a fool H3684.
026:009 [As] a thorn H2336 goeth up H5927 (8804) into the hand H3027 of a drunkard H7910, so [is] a parable H4912 in the mouth H6310 of fools H3684.
026:010 The great H7227 [God] that formed H2342 (8789) all [things] both rewardeth H7936 (8802) the fool H3684, and rewardeth H7936 (8802) transgressors H5674 (8802).
026:011 As a dog H3611 returneth H7725 (8804) to his vomit H6892, [so] a fool H3684 returneth H8138 (8802) to his folly H0200.
026:012 Seest H7200 (8804) thou a man H0376 wise H2450 in his own conceit H5869? [there is] more hope H8615 of a fool H3684 than of him.
026:013 The slothful H6102 [man] saith H0559 (8804), [There is] a lion H7826 in the way H1870; a lion H0738 [is] in the streets H7339.
026:014 [As] the door H1817 turneth H5437 (8735) upon his hinges H6735, so [doth] the slothful H6102 upon his bed H4296.
026:015 The slothful H6102 hideth H2934 (8804) his hand H3027 in [his] bosom H6747; it grieveth H3811 (8738) him to bring it again H7725 (8687) to his mouth H6310.
026:016 The sluggard H6102 [is] wiser H2450 in his own conceit H5869 than seven men H7651 that can render H7725 (8688) a reason H2940.
026:017 He that passeth by H5674 (8802), [and] meddleth H5674 (8693) with strife H7379 [belonging] not to him, [is like] one that taketh H2388 (8688) a dog H3611 by the ears H0241.
026:018 As a mad H3856 (8700) [man] who casteth H3384 (8802) firebrands H2131, arrows H2671, and death H4194,
026:019 So [is] the man H0376 [that] deceiveth H7411 (8765) his neighbour H7453, and saith H0559 (8804), Am not I in sport H7832 (8764)?
026:020 Where no H0657 wood H6086 is, [there] the fire H0784 goeth out H3518 (8799): so where [there is] no talebearer H5372, the strife H4066 ceaseth H8367 (8799).
026:021 [As] coals H6352 [are] to burning coals H1513, and wood H6086 to fire H0784; so [is] a contentious H4079 (8675) H4066 man H0376 to kindle H2787 (8771) strife H7379.
026:022 The words H1697 of a talebearer H5372 [are] as wounds H3859 (8693), and they go down H3381 (8804) into the innermost parts H2315 of the belly H0990.
026:023 Burning H1814 (8801) lips H8193 and a wicked H7451 heart H3820 [are like] a potsherd H2789 covered H6823 (8794) with silver H3701 dross H5509.
026:024 He that hateth H8130 (8802) dissembleth H5234 (8735) with his lips H8193, and layeth up H7896 (8799) deceit H4820 within H7130 him;
026:025 When he speaketh H6963 fair H2603 (8762), believe H0539 (8686) him not: for [there are] seven H7651 abominations H8441 in his heart H3820.
026:026 [Whose] hatred H8135 is covered H3680 (8691) by deceit H4860, his wickedness H7451 shall be shewed H1540 (8735) before the [whole] congregation H6951.
026:027 Whoso diggeth H3738 (8802) a pit H7845 shall fall H5307 (8799) therein: and he that rolleth H1556 (8802) a stone H0068, it will return H7725 (8799) upon him.
026:028 A lying H8267 tongue H3956 hateth H8130 (8799) [those that are] afflicted H1790 by it; and a flattering H2509 mouth H6310 worketh H6213 (8799) ruin H4072.
027:001 ¶ Boast H1984 (8691) not thyself of to morrow H4279; for thou knowest H3045 (8799) not what a day H3117 may bring forth H3205 (8799).
027:002 Let another man H2114 (8801) praise H1984 (8762) thee, and not thine own mouth H6310; a stranger H5237, and not thine own lips H8193.
027:003 A stone H0068 [is] heavy H3514, and the sand H2344 weighty H5192; but a fool’s H0191 wrath H3708 [is] heavier H3515 than them both H8147.
027:004 Wrath H2534 [is] cruel H0395, and anger H0639 [is] outrageous H7858; but who [is] able to stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 envy H7068?
027:005 Open H1540 (8794) rebuke H8433 [is] better H2896 than secret H5641 (8794) love H0160.
027:006 Faithful H0539 (8737) [are] the wounds H6482 of a friend H0157 (8802); but the kisses H5390 of an enemy H8130 (8802) [are] deceitful H6280 (8737).
027:007 The full H7649 soul H5315 loatheth H0947 (8799) an honeycomb H5317; but to the hungry H7457 soul H5315 every bitter thing H4751 is sweet H4966.
027:008 As a bird H6833 that wandereth H5074 (8802) from her nest H7064, so [is] a man H0376 that wandereth H5074 (8802) from his place H4725.
027:009 Ointment H8081 and perfume H7004 rejoice H8055 (8762) the heart H3820: so [doth] the sweetness H4986 of a man’s friend H7453 by hearty H5315 counsel H6098.
027:010 Thine own friend H7453, and thy father’s H0001 friend H7453, forsake H5800 (8799) not; neither go H0935 (8799) into thy brother’s H0251 house H1004 in the day H3117 of thy calamity H0343: [for] better H2896 [is] a neighbour H7934 [that is] near H7138 than a brother H0251 far off H7350.
027:011 My son H1121, be wise H2449 (8798), and make my heart H3820 glad H8055 (8761), that I may answer H7725 (8686) H1697 him that reproacheth H2778 (8802) me.
027:012 A prudent H6175 [man] foreseeth H7200 (8804) the evil H7451, [and] hideth H5641 (8738) himself; [but] the simple H6612 pass on H5674 (8804), [and] are punished H6064 (8738).
027:013 Take H3947 (8798) his garment H0899 that is surety H6148 (8804) for a stranger H2114 (8801), and take a pledge H2254 (8798) of him for a strange woman H5237.
027:014 He that blesseth H1288 (8764) his friend H7453 with a loud H1419 voice H6963, rising early H7925 (8687) in the morning H1242, it shall be counted H2803 (8735) a curse H7045 to him.
027:015 A continual H2956 (8802) dropping H1812 in a very rainy H5464 day H3117 and a contentious H4079 (8675) H4066 woman H0802 are alike H7737 (8739).
027:016 Whosoever hideth H6845 (8802) her hideth H6845 (8804) the wind H7307, and the ointment H8081 of his right hand H3225, [which] bewrayeth H7121 (8799) [itself].
027:017 Iron H1270 sharpeneth H2300 (8799) iron H1270; so a man H0376 sharpeneth H2300 (8686) the countenance H6440 of his friend H7453.
027:018 Whoso keepeth H5341 (8802) the fig tree H8384 shall eat H0398 (8799) the fruit H6529 thereof: so he that waiteth H8104 (8802) on his master H0113 shall be honoured H3513 (8792).
027:019 As in water H4325 face H6440 [answereth] to face H6440, so the heart H3820 of man H0120 to man H0120.
027:020 Hell H7585 and destruction H0011 (8675) H0010 are never H3808 full H7646 (8799); so the eyes H5869 of man H0120 are never satisfied H7646 (8799).
027:021 [As] the fining pot H4715 for silver H3701, and the furnace H3564 for gold H2091; so [is] a man H0376 to H6310 his praise H4110.
027:022 Though thou shouldest bray H3806 (8799) a fool H0191 in a mortar H4388 among H8432 wheat H7383 with a pestle H5940, [yet] will not his foolishness H0200 depart H5493 (8799) from him.
027:023 Be thou diligent H3045 (8799) to know H3045 (8800) the state H6440 of thy flocks H6629, [and] look H7896 (8798) well H3820 to thy herds H5739.
027:024 For riches H2633 [are] not for ever H5769: and doth the crown H5145 [endure] to every H1755 generation H1755?
027:025 The hay H2682 appeareth H1540 (8804), and the tender grass H1877 sheweth H7200 (8738) itself, and herbs H6212 of the mountains H2022 are gathered H0622 (8738).
027:026 The lambs H3532 [are] for thy clothing H3830, and the goats H6260 [are] the price H4242 of the field H7704.
027:027 And [thou shalt have] goats H5795 ’ milk H2461 enough H1767 for thy food H3899, for the food H3899 of thy household H1004, and [for] the maintenance H2416 for thy maidens H5291.
028:001 ¶ The wicked H7563 flee H5127 (8804) when no man pursueth H7291 (8802): but the righteous H6662 are bold H0982 (8799) as a lion H3715.
028:002 For the transgression H6588 of a land H0776 many H7227 [are] the princes H8269 thereof: but by a man H0120 of understanding H0995 (8688) [and] knowledge H3045 (8802) the state H3651 [thereof] shall be prolonged H0748 (8686).
028:003 A poor H7326 (8802) man H1397 that oppresseth H6231 (8802) the poor H1800 [is like] a sweeping H5502 (8802) rain H4306 which leaveth no food H3899.
028:004 They that forsake H5800 (8802) the law H8451 praise H1984 (8762) the wicked H7563: but such as keep H8104 (8802) the law H8451 contend H1624 (8691) with them.
028:005 Evil H7451 men H0582 understand H0995 (8799) not judgment H4941: but they that seek H1245 (8764) the LORD H3068 understand H0995 (8799) all [things].
028:006 Better H2896 [is] the poor H7326 (8802) that walketh H1980 (8802) in his uprightness H8537, than [he that is] perverse H6141 [in his] ways H1870, though he [be] rich H6223.
028:007 Whoso keepeth H5341 (8802) the law H8451 [is] a wise H0995 (8688) son H1121: but he that is a companion H7462 (8802) of riotous H2151 (8802) [men] shameth H3637 (8686) his father H0001.
028:008 He that by usury H5392 and unjust gain H8636 increaseth H7235 (8688) his substance H1952, he shall gather H6908 (8762) it for him that will pity H2603 (8802) the poor H1800.
028:009 He that turneth away H5493 (8688) his ear H0241 from hearing H8085 (8800) the law H8451, even his prayer H8605 [shall be] abomination H8441.
028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous H3477 to go astray H7686 (8688) in an evil H7451 way H1870, he shall fall H5307 (8799) himself into his own pit H7816: but the upright H8549 shall have good H2896 [things] in possession H5157 (8799).
028:011 The rich H6223 man H0376 [is] wise H2450 in his own conceit H5869; but the poor H1800 that hath understanding H0995 (8688) searcheth him out H2713 (8799).
028:012 When righteous H6662 [men] do rejoice H5970 (8800), [there is] great H7227 glory H8597: but when the wicked H7563 rise H6965 (8800), a man H0120 is hidden H2664 (8792).
028:013 He that covereth H3680 (8764) his sins H6588 shall not prosper H6743 (8686): but whoso confesseth H3034 (8688) and forsaketh H5800 (8802) [them] shall have mercy H7355 (8792).
028:014 Happy H0835 [is] the man H0120 that feareth H6342 (8764) alway H8548: but he that hardeneth H7185 (8688) his heart H3820 shall fall H5307 (8799) into mischief H7451.
028:015 [As] a roaring H5098 (8802) lion H0738, and a ranging H8264 (8802) bear H1677; [so is] a wicked H7563 ruler H4910 (8802) over the poor H1800 people H5971.
028:016 The prince H5057 that wanteth H2638 understanding H8394 [is] also a great H7227 oppressor H4642: [but] he that hateth H8130 (8802) covetousness H1215 shall prolong H0748 (8686) [his] days H3117.
028:017 A man H0120 that doeth violence H6231 (8803) to the blood H1818 of [any] person H5315 shall flee H5127 (8799) to the pit H0953; let no man stay H8551 (8799) him.
028:018 Whoso walketh H1980 (8802) uprightly H8549 shall be saved H3467 (8735): but [he that is] perverse H6140 (8737) [in his] ways H1870 shall fall H5307 (8799) at once H0259.
028:019 He that tilleth H5647 (8802) his land H0127 shall have plenty H7646 (8799) of bread H3899: but he that followeth H7291 (8764) after vain H7386 [persons] shall have poverty enough H7389.
028:020 A faithful H0530 man H0376 shall abound H7227 with blessings H1293: but he that maketh haste H0213 (8801) to be rich H6238 (8687) shall not be innocent H5352 (8735).
028:021 To have respect H5234 (8687) of persons H6440 [is] not good H2896: for for a piece H6595 of bread H3899 [that] man H1397 will transgress H6586 (8799).
028:022 He H0376 that hasteth H0926 (8737) to be rich H1952 [hath] an evil H7451 eye H5869, and considereth H3045 (8799) not that poverty H2639 shall come H0935 (8799) upon him.
028:023 He that rebuketh H3198 (8688) a man H0120 afterwards H0310 shall find H4672 (8799) more favour H2580 than he that flattereth H2505 (8688) with the tongue H3956.
028:024 Whoso robbeth H1497 (8802) his father H0001 or his mother H0517, and saith H0559 (8802), [It is] no transgression H6588; the same [is] the companion H2270 of a destroyer H0376 H7843 (8688).
028:025 He that is of a proud H7342 heart H5315 stirreth up H1624 (8762) strife H4066: but he that putteth his trust H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068 shall be made fat H1878 (8792).
028:026 He that trusteth H0982 (8802) in his own heart H3820 is a fool H3684: but whoso walketh H1980 (8802) wisely H2451, he shall be delivered H4422 (8735).
028:027 He that giveth H5414 (8802) unto the poor H7326 (8802) shall not lack H4270: but he that hideth H5956 (8688) his eyes H5869 shall have many H7227 a curse H3994.
028:028 When the wicked H7563 rise H6965 (8800), men H0120 hide H5641 (8735) themselves: but when they perish H0006 (8800), the righteous H6662 increase H7235 (8799).
029:001 ¶ He H0376, that being often reproved H8433 hardeneth H7185 (8688) [his] neck H6203, shall suddenly H6621 be destroyed H7665 (8735), and that without remedy H4832.
029:002 When the righteous H6662 are in authority H7235 (8800), the people H5971 rejoice H8055 (8799): but when the wicked H7563 beareth rule H4910 (8800), the people H5971 mourn H0584 (8735).
029:003 Whoso H0376 loveth H0157 (8802) wisdom H2451 rejoiceth H8055 (8762) his father H0001: but he that keepeth company H7462 (8802) with harlots H2181 (8802) spendeth H0006 (8762) [his] substance H1952.
029:004 The king H4428 by judgment H4941 establisheth H5975 (8686) the land H0776: but he H0376 that receiveth gifts H8641 overthroweth H2040 (8799) it.
029:005 A man H1397 that flattereth H2505 (8688) his neighbour H7453 spreadeth H6566 (8802) a net H7568 for his feet H6471.
029:006 In the transgression H6588 of an evil H7451 man H0376 [there is] a snare H4170: but the righteous H6662 doth sing H7442 (8799) and rejoice H8056.
029:007 The righteous H6662 considereth H3045 (8802) the cause H1779 of the poor H1800: [but] the wicked H7563 regardeth H0995 (8799) not to know H1847 [it].
029:008 Scornful H3944 men H0582 bring H6315 a city H7151 into a snare H6315 (8686): but wise H2450 [men] turn away H7725 (8686) wrath H0639.
029:009 [If] a wise H2450 man H0376 contendeth H8199 (8737) with a foolish H0191 man H0376, whether he rage H7264 (8804) or laugh H7832 (8804), [there is] no rest H5183.
029:010 The bloodthirsty H0582 H1818 hate H8130 (8799) the upright H8535: but the just H3477 seek H1245 (8762) his soul H5315.
029:011 A fool H3684 uttereth H3318 (8686) all his mind H7307: but a wise H2450 [man] keepeth H7623 (8762) it in till afterwards H0268.
029:012 If a ruler H4910 (8802) hearken H7181 (8688) to lies H1697 H8267, all his servants H8334 (8764) [are] wicked H7563.
029:013 The poor H7326 (8802) and the deceitful H8501 man H0376 meet together H6298 (8738): the LORD H3068 lighteneth H0215 (8688) both H8147 their eyes H5869.
029:014 The king H4428 that faithfully H0571 judgeth H8199 (8802) the poor H1800, his throne H3678 shall be established H3559 (8735) for ever H5703.
029:015 The rod H7626 and reproof H8433 give H5414 (8799) wisdom H2451: but a child H5288 left H7971 (8794) [to himself] bringeth his mother H0517 to shame H0954 (8688).
029:016 When the wicked H7563 are multiplied H7235 (8800), transgression H6588 increaseth H7235 (8799): but the righteous H6662 shall see H7200 (8799) their fall H4658.
029:017 Correct H3256 (8761) thy son H1121, and he shall give thee rest H5117 (8686); yea, he shall give H5414 (8799) delight H4574 unto thy soul H5315.
029:018 Where [there is] no vision H2377, the people H5971 perish H6544 (8735): but he that keepeth H8104 (8802) the law H8451, happy H0835 [is] he.
029:019 A servant H5650 will not be corrected H3256 (8735) by words H1697: for though he understand H0995 (8799) he will not answer H4617.
029:020 Seest H2372 (8804) thou a man H0376 [that is] hasty H0213 (8801) in his words H1697? [there is] more hope H8615 of a fool H3684 than of him.
029:021 He that delicately bringeth up H6445 (8764) his servant H5650 from a child H5290 shall have him become [his] son H4497 at the length H0319.
029:022 An angry H0639 man H0376 stirreth up H1624 (8762) strife H4066, and a furious H2534 man H1167 aboundeth in H7227 transgression H6588.
029:023 A man’s H0120 pride H1346 shall bring him low H8213 (8686): but honour H3519 shall uphold H8551 (8799) the humble H8217 in spirit H7307.
029:024 Whoso is partner H2505 (8802) with a thief H1590 hateth H8130 (8802) his own soul H5315: he heareth H8085 (8799) cursing H0423, and bewrayeth H5046 (8686) [it] not.
029:025 The fear H2731 of man H0120 bringeth H5414 (8799) a snare H4170: but whoso putteth his trust H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068 shall be safe H7682 (8792).
029:026 Many H7227 seek H1245 (8764) the ruler’s H4910 (8802) favour H6440; but [every] man’s H0376 judgment H4941 [cometh] from the LORD H3068.
029:027 An unjust H5766 man H0376 [is] an abomination H8441 to the just H6662: and [he that is] upright H3477 in the way H1870 [is] abomination H8441 to the wicked H7563.
030:001 ¶ The words H1697 of Agur H0094 the son H1121 of Jakeh H3348, [even] the prophecy H4853: the man H1397 spake H5002 (8803) unto Ithiel H0384, even unto Ithiel H0384 and Ucal H0401,
030:002 Surely I [am] more brutish H1198 than [any] man H0376, and have not the understanding H0998 of a man H0120.
030:003 I neither learned H3925 (8804) wisdom H2451, nor have H3045 (8799) the knowledge H1847 of the holy H6918.
030:004 Who hath ascended up H5927 (8804) into heaven H8064, or descended H3381 (8799)? who hath gathered H0622 (8804) the wind H7307 in his fists H2651? who hath bound H6887 (8804) the waters H4325 in a garment H8071? who hath established H6965 (8689) all the ends H0657 of the earth H0776? what [is] his name H8034, and what [is] his son’s H1121 name H8034, if thou canst tell H3045 (8799)?
030:005 Every word H0565 of God H0433 [is] pure H6884 (8803): he [is] a shield H4043 unto them that put their trust H2620 (8802) in him.
030:006 Add H3254 (8686) thou not unto his words H1697, lest he reprove H3198 (8686) thee, and thou be found a liar H3576 (8738).
030:007 Two H8147 [things] have I required H7592 (8804) of thee; deny H4513 (8799) me [them] not before I die H4191 (8799):
030:008 Remove far H7368 (8685) from me vanity H7723 and lies H1697 H3577: give H5414 (8799) me neither poverty H7389 nor riches H6239; feed H2963 (8685) me with food H3899 convenient H2706 for me:
030:009 Lest I be full H7646 (8799), and deny H3584 (8765) [thee], and say H0559 (8804), Who [is] the LORD H3068? or lest I be poor H3423 (8735), and steal H1589 (8804), and take H8610 (8804) the name H8034 of my God H0430 [in vain].
030:010 Accuse H3960 (8686) not a servant H5650 unto his master H0113, lest he curse H7043 (8762) thee, and thou be found guilty H0816 (8804).
030:011 [There is] a generation H1755 [that] curseth H7043 (8762) their father H0001, and doth not bless H1288 (8762) their mother H0517.
030:012 [There is] a generation H1755 [that are] pure H2889 in their own eyes H5869, and [yet] is not washed H7364 (8795) from their filthiness H6675.
030:013 [There is] a generation H1755, O how lofty H7311 (8804) are their eyes H5869! and their eyelids H6079 are lifted up H5375 (8735).
030:014 [There is] a generation H1755, whose teeth H8127 [are as] swords H2719, and their jaw teeth H4973 [as] knives H3979, to devour H0398 (8800) the poor H6041 from off the earth H0776, and the needy H0034 from [among] men H0120.
030:015 The horseleach H5936 hath two H8147 daughters H1323, [crying], Give H3051 (8798), give H3051 (8798). There are three H7969 [things that] are never satisfied H7646 (8799), [yea], four H0702 [things] say H0559 (8804) not, [It is] enough H1952:
030:016 The grave H7585; and the barren H6115 womb H7356; the earth H0776 [that] is not filled H7646 (8804) with water H4325; and the fire H0784 [that] saith H0559 (8804) not, [It is] enough H1952.
030:017 The eye H5869 [that] mocketh H3932 (8799) at [his] father H0001, and despiseth H0936 (8799) to obey H3349 [his] mother H0517, the ravens H6158 of the valley H5158 shall pick it out H5365 (8799), and the young H1121 eagles H5404 shall eat H0398 (8799) it.
030:018 There be three H7969 [things which] are too wonderful H6381 (8738) for me, yea, four H0702 which I know H3045 (8804) not:
030:019 The way H1870 of an eagle H5404 in the air H8064; the way H1870 of a serpent H5175 upon a rock H6697; the way H1870 of a ship H0591 in the midst H3820 of the sea H3220; and the way H1870 of a man H1397 with a maid H5959.
030:020 Such [is] the way H1870 of an adulterous H5003 (8764) woman H0802; she eateth H0398 (8804), and wipeth H4229 (8804) her mouth H6310, and saith H0559 (8804), I have done H6466 (8804) no wickedness H0205.
030:021 For three H7969 [things] the earth H0776 is disquieted H7264 (8804), and for four H0702 [which] it cannot H3201 (8799) bear H5375 (8800):
030:022 For a servant H5650 when he reigneth H4427 (8799); and a fool H5036 when he is filled H7646 (8799) with meat H3899;
030:023 For an odious H8130 (8803) [woman] when she is married H1166 (8735); and an handmaid H8198 that is heir H3423 (8799) to her mistress H1404.
030:024 There be four H0702 [things which are] little H6996 upon the earth H0776, but they [are] exceeding H2449 (8794) wise H2450:
030:025 The ants H5244 [are] a people H5971 not strong H5794, yet they prepare H3559 (8686) their meat H3899 in the summer H7019;
030:026 The conies H8227 [are but] a feeble H6099 folk H5971, yet make H7760 (8799) they their houses H1004 in the rocks H5553;
030:027 The locusts H0697 have no king H4428, yet go they forth H3318 (8799) all of them by bands H2686 (8802);
030:028 The spider H8079 taketh hold H8610 (8762) with her hands H3027, and is in kings H4428 ’ palaces H1964.
030:029 There be three H7969 [things] which go H6806 well H3190 (8688), yea, four H0702 are comely H2895 (8688) in going H3212 (8800):
030:030 A lion H3918 [which is] strongest H1368 among beasts H0929, and turneth not away H7725 (8799) for H6440 any;
030:031 A greyhound H4975 H2223; an he goat H8495 also H0176; and a king H4428, against whom [there is] no rising up H0510.
030:032 If thou hast done foolishly H5034 (8804) in lifting up H5375 (8692) thyself, or if thou hast thought evil H2161 (8804), [lay] thine hand H3027 upon thy mouth H6310.
030:033 Surely the churning H4330 of milk H2461 bringeth forth H3318 (8686) butter H2529, and the wringing H4330 of the nose H0639 bringeth forth H3318 (8686) blood H1818: so the forcing H4330 of wrath H0639 bringeth forth H3318 (8686) strife H7379.
031:001 ¶ The words H1697 of king H4428 Lemuel H3927, the prophecy H4853 that his mother H0517 taught H3256 (8765) him.
031:002 What, my son H1248? and what, the son H1248 of my womb H0990? and what, the son H1248 of my vows H5088?
031:003 Give H5414 (8799) not thy strength H2428 unto women H0802, nor thy ways H1870 to that which destroyeth H4229 (8687) kings H4428.
031:004 [It is] not for kings H4428, O Lemuel H3927, [it is] not for kings H4428 to drink H8354 (8800) wine H3196; nor for H0335 (8675) H0176 princes H7336 (8802) strong drink H7941:
031:005 Lest they drink H8354 (8799), and forget H7911 (8799) the law H2710 (8794), and pervert H8138 (8762) the judgment H1779 of any of the afflicted H1121 H6040.
031:006 Give H5414 (8798) strong drink H7941 unto him that is ready to perish H0006 (8802), and wine H3196 unto those that be of heavy H4751 hearts H5315.
031:007 Let him drink H8354 (8799), and forget H7911 (8799) his poverty H7389, and remember H2142 (8799) his misery H5999 no more.
031:008 Open H6605 (8798) thy mouth H6310 for the dumb H0483 in the cause H1779 of all such as are appointed H1121 to destruction H2475.
031:009 Open H6605 (8798) thy mouth H6310, judge H8199 (8798) righteously H6664, and plead H1777 (8798) the cause of the poor H6041 and needy H0034.
031:010 Who can find H4672 (8799) a virtuous H2428 woman H0802? for her price H4377 [is] far H7350 above rubies H6443.
031:011 The heart H3820 of her husband H1167 doth safely trust H0982 (8804) in her, so that he shall have no need H2637 (8799) of spoil H7998.
031:012 She will do H1580 (8804) him good H2896 and not evil H7451 all the days H3117 of her life H2416.
031:013 She seeketh H1875 (8804) wool H6785, and flax H6593, and worketh H6213 (8799) willingly H2656 with her hands H3709.
031:014 She is like the merchants H5503 (8802) ’ ships H0591; she bringeth H0935 (8686) her food H3899 from afar H4801.
031:015 She riseth H6965 (8799) also while it is yet night H3915, and giveth H5414 (8799) meat H2964 to her household H1004, and a portion H2706 to her maidens H5291.
031:016 She considereth H2161 (8804) a field H7704, and buyeth H3947 (8799) it: with the fruit H6529 of her hands H3709 she planteth H5193 (8804) a vineyard H3754.
031:017 She girdeth H2296 (8804) her loins H4975 with strength H5797, and strengtheneth H0553 (8762) her arms H2220.
031:018 She perceiveth H2938 (8804) that her merchandise H5504 [is] good H2896: her candle H5216 goeth not out H3518 (8799) by night H3915.
031:019 She layeth H7971 (8765) her hands H3027 to the spindle H3601, and her hands H3709 hold H8551 (8804) the distaff H6418.
031:020 She stretcheth out H6566 (8804) her hand H3709 to the poor H6041; yea, she reacheth forth H7971 (8765) her hands H3027 to the needy H0034.
031:021 She is not afraid H3372 (8799) of the snow H7950 for her household H1004: for all her household H1004 [are] clothed H3847 (8803) with scarlet H8144.
031:022 She maketh H6213 (8804) herself coverings of tapestry H4765; her clothing H3830 [is] silk H8336 and purple H0713.
031:023 Her husband H1167 is known H3045 (8737) in the gates H8179, when he sitteth H3427 (8800) among the elders H2205 of the land H0776.
031:024 She maketh H6213 (8804) fine linen H5466, and selleth H4376 (8799) [it]; and delivereth H5414 (8804) girdles H2289 unto the merchant H3669.
031:025 Strength H5797 and honour H1926 [are] her clothing H3830; and she shall rejoice H7832 (8799) in time H3117 to come H0314.
031:026 She openeth H6605 (8804) her mouth H6310 with wisdom H2451; and in her tongue H3956 [is] the law H8451 of kindness H2617.
031:027 She looketh well H6822 (8802) to the ways H1979 (8675) H1979 of her household H1004, and eateth H0398 (8799) not the bread H3899 of idleness H6104.
031:028 Her children H1121 arise up H6965 (8804), and call her blessed H0833 (8762); her husband H1167 [also], and he praiseth H1984 (8762) her.
031:029 Many H7227 daughters H1323 have done H6213 (8804) virtuously H2428, but thou excellest H5927 (8804) them all.
031:030 Favour H2580 [is] deceitful H8267, and beauty H3308 [is] vain H1892: [but] a woman H0802 [that] feareth H3373 the LORD H3068, she shall be praised H1984 (8691).
031:031 Give H5414 (8798) her of the fruit H6529 of her hands H3027; and let her own works H4639 praise H1984 (8762) her in the gates H8179.
