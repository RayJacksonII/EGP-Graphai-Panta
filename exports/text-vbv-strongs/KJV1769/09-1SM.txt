001:001 ¶ Now there was a certain H0259 man H0376 of Ramathaimzophim H7436, of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and his name H8034 [was] Elkanah H0511, the son H1121 of Jeroham H3395, the son H1121 of Elihu H0453, the son H1121 of Tohu H8459, the son H1121 of Zuph H6689, an Ephrathite H0673:
001:002 And he had two H8147 wives H0802; the name H8034 of the one H0259 [was] Hannah H2584, and the name H8034 of the other H8145 Peninnah H6444: and Peninnah H6444 had children H3206, but Hannah H2584 had no children H3206.
001:003 And this H1931 man H0376 went up H5927 (8804) out of his city H5892 yearly H3117 H3117 to worship H7812 (8692) and to sacrifice H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 in Shiloh H7887. And the two H8147 sons H1121 of Eli H5941, Hophni H2652 and Phinehas H6372, the priests H3548 of the LORD H3068, [were] there.
001:004 And when the time H3117 was that Elkanah H0511 offered H2076 (8799), he gave H5414 (8804) to Peninnah H6444 his wife H0802, and to all her sons H1121 and her daughters H1323, portions H4490:
001:005 But unto Hannah H2584 he gave H5414 (8799) a H0259 worthy H0639 portion H4490; for he loved H0157 (8804) Hannah H2584: but the LORD H3068 had shut up H5462 (8804) her womb H7358.
001:006 And her adversary H6869 also provoked H3707 (8765) her sore H3708, for to make her fret H7481 (8687), because the LORD H3068 had shut H5462 (8804) up H1157 her womb H7358.
001:007 And [as] he did H6213 (8799) so year H8141 by year H8141, when H1767 she went up H5927 (8800) to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, so she provoked H3707 (8686) her; therefore she wept H1058 (8799), and did not eat H0398 (8799).
001:008 Then said H0559 (8799) Elkanah H0511 her husband H0376 to her, Hannah H2584, why weepest H1058 (8799) thou? and why eatest H0398 (8799) thou not? and why is thy heart H3824 grieved H3415 (8799)? [am] not I better H2896 to thee than ten H6235 sons H1121?
001:009 So Hannah H2584 rose up H6965 (8799) after H0310 they had eaten H0398 (8800) in Shiloh H7887, and after H0310 they had drunk H8354 (8800). Now Eli H5941 the priest H3548 sat H3427 (8802) upon a seat H3678 by a post H4201 of the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068.
001:010 And she [was] in bitterness H4751 of soul H5315, and prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, and wept H1058 (8799) sore H1058 (8800).
001:011 And she vowed H5087 (8799) a vow H5088, and said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, if thou wilt indeed H7200 (8800) look H7200 (8799) on the affliction H6040 of thine handmaid H0519, and remember H2142 (8804) me, and not forget H7911 (8799) thine handmaid H0519, but wilt give H5414 (8804) unto thine handmaid H0519 a man H0582 child H2233, then I will give H5414 (8804) him unto the LORD H3068 all the days H3117 of his life H2416, and there shall no razor H4177 come H5927 (8799) upon his head H7218.
001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued H7235 (8689) praying H6419 (8692) before H6440 the LORD H3068, that Eli H5941 marked H8104 (8802) her mouth H6310.
001:013 Now Hannah H2584, she spake H1696 (8764) in her heart H3820; only her lips H8193 moved H5128 (8801), but her voice H6963 was not heard H8085 (8735): therefore Eli H5941 thought H2803 (8799) she had been drunken H7910.
001:014 And Eli H5941 said H0559 (8799) unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken H7937 (8691)? put away H5493 (8685) thy wine H3196 from thee.
001:015 And Hannah H2584 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), No, my lord H0113, I [am] a woman H0802 of a sorrowful H7186 spirit H7307: I have drunk H8354 (8804) neither wine H3196 nor strong drink H7941, but have poured out H8210 (8799) my soul H5315 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
001:016 Count H5414 (8799) not thine handmaid H0519 for H6440 a daughter H1323 of Belial H1100: for out of the abundance H7230 of my complaint H7879 and grief H3708 have I spoken H1696 (8765) hitherto.
001:017 Then Eli H5941 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965: and the God H0430 of Israel H3478 grant H5414 (8799) [thee] thy petition H7596 that thou hast asked H7592 (8804) of him.
001:018 And she said H0559 (8799), Let thine handmaid H8198 find H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869. So the woman H0802 went H3212 (8799) her way H1870, and did eat H0398 (8799), and her countenance H6440 was no more [sad].
001:019 And they rose up H7925 in the morning H1242 early H7925 (8686), and worshipped H7812 (8691) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and returned H7725 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to their house H1004 to Ramah H7414: and Elkanah H0511 knew H3045 (8799) Hannah H2584 his wife H0802; and the LORD H3068 remembered H2142 (8799) her.
001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time H3117 was come H8622 about after Hannah H2584 had conceived H2029 (8799), that she bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Samuel H8050, [saying], Because I have asked H7592 (8804) him of the LORD H3068.
001:021 And the man H0376 Elkanah H0511, and all his house H1004, went up H5927 (8799) to offer H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 the yearly H3117 sacrifice H2077, and his vow H5088.
001:022 But Hannah H2584 went not up H5927 (8804); for she said H0559 (8804) unto her husband H0376, [I will not go up] until the child H5288 be weaned H1580 (8735), and [then] I will bring H0935 (8689) him, that he may appear H7200 (8738) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and there abide H3427 (8804) for H5704 ever H5769.
001:023 And Elkanah H0511 her husband H0376 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Do H6213 (8798) what seemeth H5869 thee good H2896; tarry H3427 (8798) until thou have weaned H1580 (8800) him; only the LORD H3068 establish H6965 (8686) his word H1697. So the woman H0802 abode H3427 (8799), and gave her son H1121 suck H3243 (8686) until she weaned H1580 (8800) him.
001:024 And when she had weaned H1580 (8804) him, she took him up H5927 (8686) with her, with three H7969 bullocks H6499, and one H0259 ephah H0374 of flour H7058, and a bottle H5035 of wine H3196, and brought H0935 (8686) him unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 in Shiloh H7887: and the child H5288 [was] young H5288.
001:025 And they slew H7819 (8799) a bullock H6499, and brought H0935 (8686) the child H5288 to Eli H5941.
001:026 And she said H0559 (8799), Oh H0994 my lord H0113, [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, my lord H0113, I [am] the woman H0802 that stood H5324 (8737) by thee here, praying H6419 (8692) unto the LORD H3068.
001:027 For this child H5288 I prayed H6419 (8694); and the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8799) me my petition H7596 which I asked H7592 (8804) of him:
001:028 Therefore also I have lent H7592 (8689) him to the LORD H3068; as long as he liveth H3117 he shall be lent H7592 (8803) to the LORD H3068. And he worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068 there.
002:001 ¶ And Hannah H2584 prayed H6419 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), My heart H3820 rejoiceth H5970 (8804) in the LORD H3068, mine horn H7161 is exalted H7311 (8804) in the LORD H3068: my mouth H6310 is enlarged H7337 (8804) over mine enemies H0341 (8802); because I rejoice H8055 (8804) in thy salvation H3444.
002:002 [There is] none holy H6918 as the LORD H3068: for [there is] none beside H1115 thee: neither [is there] any rock H6697 like our God H0430.
002:003 Talk H1696 (8762) no more H7235 (8686) so exceeding H1364 proudly H1364; let [not] arrogancy H6277 come H3318 (8799) out of your mouth H6310: for the LORD H3068 [is] a God H0410 of knowledge H1844, and by him actions H5949 are weighed H8505 (8738).
002:004 The bows H7198 of the mighty men H1368 [are] broken H2844, and they that stumbled H3782 (8737) are girded H0247 (8804) with strength H2428.
002:005 [They that were] full H7649 have hired out H7936 (8738) themselves for bread H3899; and [they that were] hungry H7457 ceased H2308 (8804): so that the barren H6135 hath born H3205 (8804) seven H7651; and she that hath many H7227 children H1121 is waxed feeble H0535 (8797).
002:006 The LORD H3068 killeth H4191 (8688), and maketh alive H2421 (8764): he bringeth down H3381 (8688) to the grave H7585, and bringeth up H5927 (8686).
002:007 The LORD H3068 maketh poor H3423 (8688), and maketh rich H6238 (8688): he bringeth low H8213 (8688), and H0637 lifteth up H7311 (8789).
002:008 He raiseth up H6965 (8688) the poor H1800 out of the dust H6083, [and] lifteth up H7311 (8686) the beggar H0034 from the dunghill H0830, to set H3427 (8687) [them] among princes H5081, and to make them inherit H5157 (8686) the throne H3678 of glory H3519: for the pillars H4690 of the earth H0776 [are] the LORD’S H3068, and he hath set H7896 (8799) the world H8398 upon them.
002:009 He will keep H8104 (8799) the feet H7272 of his saints H2623, and the wicked H7563 shall be silent H1826 (8735) in darkness H2822; for by strength H3581 shall no man H0376 prevail H1396 (8799).
002:010 The adversaries H7378 (8688) of the LORD H3068 shall be broken to pieces H2865 (8735); out of heaven H8064 shall he thunder H7481 (8686) upon them: the LORD H3068 shall judge H1777 (8799) the ends H0657 of the earth H0776; and he shall give H5414 (8799) strength H5797 unto his king H4428, and exalt H7311 (8686) the horn H7161 of his anointed H4899.
002:011 And Elkanah H0511 went H3212 (8799) to Ramah H7414 to his house H1004. And the child H5288 did H1961 (8804) minister H8334 (8764) unto the LORD H3068 before H6440 Eli H5941 the priest H3548.
002:012 Now the sons H1121 of Eli H5941 [were] sons H1121 of Belial H1100; they knew H3045 (8804) not the LORD H3068.
002:013 And the priests H3548 ’ custom H4941 with the people H5971 [was, that], when any man H0376 offered H2076 (8802) sacrifice H2077, the priest’s H3548 servant H5288 came H0935 (8804), while the flesh H1320 was in seething H1310 (8763), with a fleshhook H4207 of three H7969 teeth H8127 in his hand H3027;
002:014 And he struck H5221 (8689) [it] into the pan H3595, or kettle H1731, or caldron H7037, or pot H6517; all that the fleshhook H4207 brought up H5927 (8686) the priest H3548 took H3947 (8799) for himself. So they did H6213 (8799) in Shiloh H7887 unto all the Israelites H3478 that came H0935 (8802) thither.
002:015 Also before they burnt H6999 (8686) the fat H2459, the priest’s H3548 servant H5288 came H0935 (8804), and said H0559 (8804) to the man H0376 that sacrificed H2076 (8802), Give H5414 (8798) flesh H1320 to roast H6740 (8800) for the priest H3548; for he will not have H3947 (8799) sodden H1310 (8794) flesh H1320 of thee, but raw H2416.
002:016 And [if] any man H0376 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Let them not fail H6999 (8686) to burn H6999 (8763) the fat H2459 presently H3117, and [then] take H3947 (8798) [as much] as thy soul H5315 desireth H0183 (8762); then he would answer H0559 (8804) him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give H5414 (8799) [it me] now: and if not, I will take H3947 (8804) [it] by force H2394.
002:017 Wherefore the sin H2403 of the young men H5288 was very H3966 great H1419 before H6440 the LORD H3068: for men H0582 abhorred H5006 (8765) the offering H4503 of the LORD H3068.
002:018 But Samuel H8050 ministered H8334 (8764) before H6440 the LORD H3068, [being] a child H5288, girded H2296 (8803) with a linen H0906 ephod H0646.
002:019 Moreover his mother H0517 made H6213 (8799) him a little H6996 coat H4598, and brought H5927 (8689) [it] to him from year H3117 to year H3117, when she came up H5927 (8800) with her husband H0376 to offer H2076 (8800) the yearly H3117 sacrifice H2077.
002:020 And Eli H5941 blessed H1288 (8765) Elkanah H0511 and his wife H0802, and said H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 give H7760 (8799) thee seed H2233 of this woman H0802 for the loan H7596 which is lent H7592 (8804) to the LORD H3068. And they went H1980 (8804) unto their own home H4725.
002:021 And H3588 the LORD H3068 visited H6485 (8804) Hannah H2584, so that she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) three H7969 sons H1121 and two H8147 daughters H1323. And the child H5288 Samuel H8050 grew H1431 (8799) before H5973 the LORD H3068.
002:022 Now Eli H5941 was very H3966 old H2204 (8804), and heard H8085 (8804) all that his sons H1121 did H6213 (8799) unto all Israel H3478; and how they lay H7901 (8799) with the women H0802 that assembled H6633 (8802) [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
002:023 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Why do H6213 (8799) ye such things H1697? for I hear H8085 (8802) of your evil H7451 dealings H1697 by all this people H5971.
002:024 Nay, my sons H1121; for [it is] no good H2896 report H8052 that I hear H8085 (8802): ye make the LORD’S H3068 people H5971 to transgress H5674 (8688).
002:025 If one man H0376 sin H2398 (8799) against another H0376, the judge H0430 shall judge H6419 (8765) him: but if a man H0376 sin H2398 (8799) against the LORD H3068, who shall intreat H6419 (8691) for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened H8085 (8799) not unto the voice H6963 of their father H0001, because the LORD H3068 would H2654 (8804) slay H4191 (8687) them.
002:026 And the child H5288 Samuel H8050 grew H1432 on H1980 (8802), and was in favour H2896 both with the LORD H3068, and also with men H0582.
002:027 And there came H0935 (8799) a man H0376 of God H0430 unto Eli H5941, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Did I plainly H1540 (8736) appear H1540 (8738) unto the house H1004 of thy father H0001, when they were in Egypt H4714 in Pharaoh’s H6547 house H1004?
002:028 And did I choose H0977 (8800) him out of all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 [to be] my priest H3548, to offer H5927 (8800) upon mine altar H4196, to burn H6999 (8687) incense H7004, to wear H5375 (8800) an ephod H0646 before H6440 me? and did I give H5414 (8799) unto the house H1004 of thy father H0001 all the offerings made by fire H0801 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478?
002:029 Wherefore kick H1163 (8799) ye at my sacrifice H2077 and at mine offering H4503, which I have commanded H6680 (8765) [in my] habitation H4583; and honourest H3513 (8762) thy sons H1121 above me, to make yourselves fat H1254 (8687) with the chiefest H7225 of all the offerings H4503 of Israel H3478 my people H5971?
002:030 Wherefore the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 saith H5002 (8803), I said H0559 (8804) indeed H0559 (8800) [that] thy house H1004, and the house H1004 of thy father H0001, should walk H1980 (8691) before H6440 me for H5704 ever H5769: but now the LORD H3068 saith H5002 (8803), Be it far from me H2486; for them that honour H3513 (8764) me I will honour H3513 (8762), and they that despise H0959 (8802) me shall be lightly esteemed H7043 (8799).
002:031 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), that I will cut off H1438 (8804) thine arm H2220, and the arm H2220 of thy father’s H0001 house H1004, that there shall not be an old man H2205 in thine house H1004.
002:032 And thou shalt see H5027 (8689) an enemy H6862 [in my] habitation H4583, in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give H3190 (8686) Israel H3478: and there shall not be an old man H2205 in thine house H1004 for ever H3117.
002:033 And the man H0376 of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off H3772 (8686) from mine altar H4196, [shall be] to consume H3615 (8763) thine eyes H5869, and to grieve H0109 thine heart H5315: and all the increase H4768 of thine house H1004 shall die H4191 (8799) in the flower of their age H0582.
002:034 And this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto thee, that shall come H0935 (8799) upon thy two H8147 sons H1121, on Hophni H2652 and Phinehas H6372; in one H0259 day H3117 they shall die H4191 (8799) both H8147 of them.
002:035 And I will raise me up H6965 (8689) a faithful H0539 (8737) priest H3548, [that] shall do H6213 (8799) according to [that] which [is] in mine heart H3824 and in my mind H5315: and I will build H1129 (8804) him a sure H0539 (8737) house H1004; and he shall walk H1980 (8694) before H6440 mine anointed H4899 for ever H3117.
002:036 And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left H3498 (8737) in thine house H1004 shall come H0935 (8799) [and] crouch H7812 (8692) to him for a piece H0095 of silver H3701 and a morsel H3603 of bread H3899, and shall say H0559 (8804), Put H5596 (8798) me, I pray thee, into one H0259 of the priests’ offices H3550, that I may eat H0398 (8800) a piece H6595 of bread H3899.
003:001 ¶ And the child H5288 Samuel H8050 ministered H8334 (8764) unto the LORD H3068 before H6440 Eli H5941. And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 was precious H3368 in those days H3117; [there was] no open H6555 (8737) vision H2377.
003:002 And it came to pass at that time H3117, when Eli H5941 [was] laid down H7901 (8802) in his place H4725, and his eyes H5869 began H2490 (8689) to wax dim H3544, [that] he could H3201 (8799) not see H7200 (8800);
003:003 And ere the lamp H5216 of God H0430 went out H3518 (8799) in the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, where the ark H0727 of God H0430 [was], and Samuel H8050 was laid down H7901 (8802) [to sleep];
003:004 That the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8799) Samuel H8050: and he answered H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
003:005 And he ran H7323 (8799) unto Eli H5941, and said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I H2009; for thou calledst H7121 (8804) me. And he said H0559 (8799), I called H7121 (8804) not; lie down H7901 (8798) again H7725 (8798). And he went H3212 (8799) and lay down H7901 (8799).
003:006 And the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8800) yet again H3254 (8686), Samuel H8050. And Samuel H8050 arose H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799) to Eli H5941, and said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I; for thou didst call H7121 (8804) me. And he answered H0559 (8799), I called H7121 (8804) not, my son H1121; lie down H7901 (8798) again H7725 (8798).
003:007 Now Samuel H8050 did not yet H2962 know H3045 (8804) the LORD H3068, neither was the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 yet revealed H1540 (8735) unto him.
003:008 And the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8800) Samuel H8050 again H3254 (8686) the third time H7992. And he arose H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799) to Eli H5941, and said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I; for thou didst call H7121 (8804) me. And Eli H5941 perceived H0995 (8799) that the LORD H3068 had called H7121 (8802) the child H5288.
003:009 Therefore Eli H5941 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Go H3212 (8798), lie down H7901 (8798): and it shall be, if he call H7121 (8799) thee, that thou shalt say H0559 (8804), Speak H1696 (8761), LORD H3068; for thy servant H5650 heareth H8085 (8802). So Samuel H8050 went H3212 (8799) and lay down H7901 (8799) in his place H4725.
003:010 And the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8799), and stood H3320 (8691), and called H7121 (8799) as at other times H6471, Samuel H8050, Samuel H8050. Then Samuel H8050 answered H0559 (8799), Speak H1696 (8761); for thy servant H5650 heareth H8085 (8802).
003:011 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) to Samuel H8050, Behold, I will do H6213 (8802) a thing H1697 in Israel H3478, at which both H8147 the ears H0241 of every one that heareth H8085 (8802) it shall tingle H6750 (8799).
003:012 In that day H3117 I will perform H6965 (8686) against Eli H5941 all [things] which I have spoken H1696 (8765) concerning H0413 his house H1004: when I begin H2490 (8687), I will also make an end H3615 (8763).
003:013 For I have told H5046 (8689) him that I will judge H8199 (8802) his house H1004 for H5704 ever H5769 for the iniquity H5771 which he knoweth H3045 (8804); because his sons H1121 made themselves vile H7043 (8764), and he restrained H3543 (8765) them not.
003:014 And therefore I have sworn H7650 (8738) unto the house H1004 of Eli H5941, that the iniquity H5771 of Eli’s H5941 house H1004 shall not be purged H3722 (8691) with sacrifice H2077 nor offering H4503 for H5704 ever H5769.
003:015 And Samuel H8050 lay H7901 (8799) until the morning H1242, and opened H6605 (8799) the doors H1817 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. And Samuel H8050 feared H3372 (8804) to shew H5046 (8687) Eli H5941 the vision H4759.
003:016 Then Eli H5941 called H7121 (8799) Samuel H8050, and said H0559 (8799), Samuel H8050, my son H1121. And he answered H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
003:017 And he said H0559 (8799), What [is] the thing H1697 that [the LORD] hath said H1696 (8765) unto thee? I pray thee hide H3582 (8762) [it] not from me: God H0430 do so H6213 (8799) to thee, and more also H3254 (8686), if thou hide H3582 (8762) [any] thing H1697 from me of all the things H1697 that he said H1696 (8765) unto thee.
003:018 And Samuel H8050 told H5046 (8686) him every whit H1697, and hid H3582 (8765) nothing from him. And he said H0559 (8799), It [is] the LORD H3068: let him do H6213 (8799) what seemeth H5869 him good H2896.
003:019 And Samuel H8050 grew H1431 (8799), and the LORD H3068 was with him, and did let none of his words H1697 fall H5307 (8689) to the ground H0776.
003:020 And all Israel H3478 from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884 knew H3045 (8799) that Samuel H8050 [was] established H0539 (8737) [to be] a prophet H5030 of the LORD H3068.
003:021 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8736) again H3254 (8686) in Shiloh H7887: for the LORD H3068 revealed H1540 (8738) himself to Samuel H8050 in Shiloh H7887 by the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
004:001 ¶ And the word H1697 of Samuel H8050 came to all Israel H3478. Now Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Philistines H6430 to battle H4421, and pitched H2583 (8799) beside Ebenezer H0072: and the Philistines H6430 pitched H2583 (8804) in Aphek H0663.
004:002 And the Philistines H6430 put themselves in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) Israel H3478: and when they joined H5203 (8799) battle H4421, Israel H3478 was smitten H5062 (8735) before H6440 the Philistines H6430: and they slew H5221 (8686) of the army H4634 in the field H7704 about four H0702 thousand H0505 men H0376.
004:003 And when the people H5971 were come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264, the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore hath the LORD H3068 smitten H5062 (8804) us to day H3117 before H6440 the Philistines H6430? Let us fetch H3947 (8799) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 out of Shiloh H7887 unto us, that, when it cometh H0935 (8799) among H7130 us, it may save H3467 (8686) us out of the hand H3709 of our enemies H0341 (8802).
004:004 So the people H5971 sent H7971 (8799) to Shiloh H7887, that they might bring H5375 (8799) from thence the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, which dwelleth H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742: and the two H8147 sons H1121 of Eli H5941, Hophni H2652 and Phinehas H6372, [were] there with the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of God H0430.
004:005 And when the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8800) into the camp H4264, all Israel H3478 shouted H7321 (8686) with a great H1419 shout H8643, so that the earth H0776 rang again H1949 (8735).
004:006 And when the Philistines H6430 heard H8085 (8799) the noise H6963 of the shout H8643, they said H0559 (8799), What [meaneth] the noise H6963 of this great H1419 shout H8643 in the camp H4264 of the Hebrews H5680? And they understood H3045 (8799) that the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 was come H0935 (8804) into the camp H4264.
004:007 And the Philistines H6430 were afraid H3372 (8799), for they said H0559 (8804), God H0430 is come H0935 (8804) into the camp H4264. And they said H0559 (8799), Woe H0188 unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore H0865 H8032.
004:008 Woe H0188 unto us! who shall deliver H5337 (8686) us out of the hand H3027 of these mighty H0117 Gods H0430? these [are] the Gods H0430 that smote H5221 (8688) the Egyptians H4714 with all the plagues H4347 in the wilderness H4057.
004:009 Be strong H2388 (8690), and quit H1961 (8798) yourselves like men H0582, O ye Philistines H6430, that ye be not servants H5647 (8799) unto the Hebrews H5680, as they have been H5647 (8804) to you: quit H1961 (8804) yourselves like men H0582, and fight H3898 (8738).
004:010 And the Philistines H6430 fought H3898 (8735), and Israel H3478 was smitten H5062 (8735), and they fled H5127 (8799) every man H0376 into his tent H0168: and there was a very H3966 great H1419 slaughter H4347; for there fell H5307 (8799) of Israel H3478 thirty H7970 thousand H0505 footmen H7273.
004:011 And the ark H0727 of God H0430 was taken H3947 (8738); and the two H8147 sons H1121 of Eli H5941, Hophni H2652 and Phinehas H6372, were slain H4191 (8804).
004:012 And there ran H7323 (8799) a man H0376 of Benjamin H1144 out of the army H4634, and came H0935 (8799) to Shiloh H7887 the same day H3117 with his clothes H4055 rent H7167 (8803), and with earth H0127 upon his head H7218.
004:013 And when he came H0935 (8799), lo, Eli H5941 sat H3427 (8802) upon a seat H3678 by the wayside H1870 H3027 (8675) H3197 watching H6822 (8764): for his heart H3820 trembled H2730 for the ark H0727 of God H0430. And when the man H0376 came H0935 (8802) into the city H5892, and told H5046 (8687) [it], all the city H5892 cried out H2199 (8799).
004:014 And when Eli H5941 heard H8085 (8799) the noise H6963 of the crying H6818, he said H0559 (8799), What [meaneth] the noise H6963 of this tumult H1995? And the man H0376 came H0935 (8799) in hastily H4116 (8765), and told H5046 (8686) Eli H5941.
004:015 Now Eli H5941 was ninety H8673 and eight H8083 years H8141 old H1121; and his eyes H5869 were dim H6965 (8804), that he could H3201 (8804) not see H7200 (8800).
004:016 And the man H0376 said H0559 (8799) unto Eli H5941, I [am] he that came H0935 (8802) out of the army H4634, and I fled H5127 (8804) to day H3117 out of the army H4634. And he said H0559 (8799), What is there done H1697, my son H1121?
004:017 And the messenger H1319 (8764) answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Israel H3478 is fled H5127 (8804) before H6440 the Philistines H6430, and there hath been also a great H1419 slaughter H4046 among the people H5971, and thy two H8147 sons H1121 also, Hophni H2652 and Phinehas H6372, are dead H4191 (8804), and the ark H0727 of God H0430 is taken H3947 (8738).
004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention H2142 (8687) of the ark H0727 of God H0430, that he fell H5307 (8799) from off the seat H3678 backward H0322 by H1157 the side H3027 of the gate H8179, and his neck H4665 brake H7665 (8735), and he died H4191 (8799): for he was an old H2204 (8804) man H0376, and heavy H3513 (8804). And he had judged H8199 (8804) Israel H3478 forty H0705 years H8141.
004:019 And his daughter in law H3618, Phinehas H6372 ’ wife H0802, was with child H2030, [near] to be delivered H3205 (8800): and when she heard H8085 (8799) the tidings H8052 that H0413 the ark H0727 of God H0430 was taken H3947 (8736), and that her father in law H2524 and her husband H0376 were dead H4191 (8804), she bowed H3766 (8799) herself and travailed H3205 (8799); for her pains H6735 came H2015 (8738) upon her.
004:020 And about the time H6256 of her death H4191 (8800) the women that stood H5324 (8737) by her said H1696 (8762) unto her, Fear H3372 (8799) not; for thou hast born H3205 (8804) a son H1121. But she answered H6030 (8804) not, neither did she regard H7896 (8804) H3820 [it].
004:021 And she named H7121 (8799) the child H5288 Ichabod H0350, saying H0559 (8800), The glory H3519 is departed H1540 (8804) from Israel H3478: because H0413 the ark H0727 of God H0430 was taken H3947 (8736), and because of her father in law H2524 and her husband H0376.
004:022 And she said H0559 (8799), The glory H3519 is departed H1540 (8804) from Israel H3478: for the ark H0727 of God H0430 is taken H3947 (8738).
005:001 ¶ And the Philistines H6430 took H3947 (8804) the ark H0727 of God H0430, and brought H0935 (8686) it from Ebenezer H0072 unto Ashdod H0795.
005:002 When the Philistines H6430 took H3947 (8799) the ark H0727 of God H0430, they brought H0935 (8686) it into the house H1004 of Dagon H1712, and set H3322 (8686) it by H0681 Dagon H1712.
005:003 And when they of Ashdod H0796 arose early H7925 (8686) on the morrow H4283, behold, Dagon H1712 [was] fallen H5307 (8802) upon his face H6440 to the earth H0776 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068. And they took H3947 (8799) Dagon H1712, and set H7725 him in his place H4725 again H7725 (8686).
005:004 And when they arose early H7925 (8686) on the morrow H4283 morning H1242, behold, Dagon H1712 [was] fallen H5307 (8802) upon his face H6440 to the ground H0776 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068; and the head H7218 of Dagon H1712 and both H8147 the palms H3709 of his hands H3027 [were] cut off H3772 (8803) upon the threshold H4670; only [the stump of] Dagon H1712 was left H7604 (8738) to him.
005:005 Therefore neither the priests H3548 of Dagon H1712, nor any that come H0935 (8802) into Dagon’s H1712 house H1004, tread H1869 (8799) on the threshold H4670 of Dagon H1712 in Ashdod H0795 unto this day H3117.
005:006 But the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was heavy H3513 (8799) upon them of Ashdod H0796, and he destroyed H8074 (8686) them, and smote H5221 (8686) them with emerods H2914 (8675) H6076, [even] Ashdod H0795 and the coasts H1366 thereof.
005:007 And when the men H0582 of Ashdod H0795 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] so, they said H0559 (8804), The ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 shall not abide H3427 (8799) with us: for his hand H3027 is sore H7185 (8804) upon us, and upon Dagon H1712 our god H0430.
005:008 They sent H7971 (8799) therefore and gathered H0622 (8799) all the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 unto them, and said H0559 (8799), What shall we do H6213 (8799) with the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478? And they answered H0559 (8799), Let the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 be carried about H5437 (8735) unto Gath H1661. And they carried H5437 the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 about H5437 (8686) [thither].
005:009 And it was [so], that, after H0310 they had carried it about H5437 (8689), the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was against the city H5892 with a very H3966 great H1419 destruction H4103: and he smote H5221 (8686) the men H0582 of the city H5892, both small H6996 and great H1419, and they had emerods H2914 (8675) H6076 in their secret parts H8368 (8735).
005:010 Therefore they sent H7971 (8762) the ark H0727 of God H0430 to Ekron H6138. And it came to pass, as the ark H0727 of God H0430 came H0935 (8800) to Ekron H6138, that the Ekronites H6139 cried out H2199 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), They have brought about H5437 (8689) the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478 to us, to slay H4191 (8687) us and our people H5971.
005:011 So they sent H7971 (8799) and gathered together H0622 (8799) all the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430, and said H0559 (8799), Send away H7971 (8761) the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478, and let it go again H7725 (8799) to his own place H4725, that it slay H4191 (8686) us not, and our people H5971: for there was a deadly H4194 destruction H4103 throughout all the city H5892; the hand H3027 of God H0430 was very H3966 heavy H3513 (8804) there.
005:012 And the men H0582 that died H4191 (8804) not were smitten H5221 (8717) with the emerods H2914 (8675) H6076: and the cry H7775 of the city H5892 went up H5927 (8799) to heaven H8064.
006:001 ¶ And the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 was in the country H7704 of the Philistines H6430 seven H7651 months H2320.
006:002 And the Philistines H6430 called H7121 (8799) for the priests H3548 and the diviners H7080 (8802), saying H0559 (8800), What shall we do H6213 (8799) to the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068? tell H3045 (8685) us wherewith we shall send H7971 (8762) it to his place H4725.
006:003 And they said H0559 (8799), If ye send away H7971 (8764) the ark H0727 of the God H0430 of Israel H3478, send H7971 (8762) it not empty H7387; but in any wise H7725 (8687) return H7725 (8686) him a trespass offering H0817: then ye shall be healed H7495 (8735), and it shall be known H3045 (8738) to you why his hand H3027 is not removed H5493 (8799) from you.
006:004 Then said H0559 (8799) they, What [shall be] the trespass offering H0817 which we shall return H7725 (8686) to him? They answered H0559 (8799), Five H2568 golden H2091 emerods H2914 (8675) H6076, and five H2568 golden H2091 mice H5909, [according to] the number H4557 of the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430: for one H0259 plague H4046 [was] on you all, and on your lords H5633.
006:005 Wherefore ye shall make H6213 (8804) images H6754 of your emerods H2914 (8675) H6076, and images H6754 of your mice H5909 that mar H7843 (8688) the land H0776; and ye shall give H5414 (8804) glory H3519 unto the God H0430 of Israel H3478: peradventure he will lighten H7043 (8686) his hand H3027 from off you, and from off your gods H0430, and from off your land H0776.
006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden H3513 (8762) your hearts H3824, as the Egyptians H4714 and Pharaoh H6547 hardened H3513 (8765) their hearts H3820? when he had wrought wonderfully H5953 (8694) among them, did they not let the people go H7971 (8762), and they departed H3212 (8799)?
006:007 Now therefore make H6213 (8798) a H0259 new H2319 cart H5699, and take H3947 (8798) two H8147 milch H5763 (8802) kine H6510, on which there hath come H5927 (8804) no yoke H5923, and tie H0631 (8804) the kine H6510 to the cart H5699, and bring H7725 (8689) their calves H1121 home H1004 from them H0310:
006:008 And take H3947 (8804) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, and lay H5414 (8804) it upon the cart H5699; and put H7760 (8799) the jewels H3627 of gold H2091, which ye return H7725 (8689) him [for] a trespass offering H0817, in a coffer H0712 by the side H6654 thereof; and send it away H7971 (8765), that it may go H1980 (8804).
006:009 And see H7200 (8804), if it goeth up H5927 (8799) by the way H1870 of his own coast H1366 to Bethshemesh H1053, [then] he hath done H6213 (8804) us this great H1419 evil H7451: but if not, then we shall know H3045 (8804) that [it is] not his hand H3027 [that] smote H5060 (8804) us: it [was] a chance H4745 [that] happened to us H1961 (8804).
006:010 And the men H0582 did so H6213 (8799); and took H3947 (8799) two H8147 milch H5763 (8802) kine H6510, and tied H0631 (8799) them to the cart H5699, and shut up H3607 (8804) their calves H1121 at home H1004:
006:011 And they laid H7760 (8799) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 upon the cart H5699, and the coffer H0712 with the mice H5909 of gold H2091 and the images H6754 of their emerods H2914.
006:012 And the kine H6510 took the straight H3474 (8799) way H1870 to the way H1870 of Bethshemesh H1053, [and] went along H1980 (8804) the highway H4546 H0259, lowing H1600 (8800) as they went H1980 (8800), and turned not aside H5493 (8804) [to] the right hand H3225 or [to] the left H8040; and the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 went H1980 (8802) after H0310 them unto the border H1366 of Bethshemesh H1053.
006:013 And [they of] Bethshemesh H1053 [were] reaping H7114 (8802) their wheat H2406 harvest H7105 in the valley H6010: and they lifted up H5375 (8799) their eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) the ark H0727, and rejoiced H8055 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) [it].
006:014 And the cart H5699 came H0935 (8802) into the field H7704 of Joshua H3091, a Bethshemite H1030, and stood H5975 (8799) there, where [there was] a great H1419 stone H0068: and they clave H1234 (8762) the wood H6086 of the cart H5699, and offered H5927 (8689) the kine H6510 a burnt offering H5930 unto the LORD H3068.
006:015 And the Levites H3881 took down H3381 (8689) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, and the coffer H0712 that [was] with it, wherein the jewels H3627 of gold H2091 [were], and put H7760 (8799) [them] on the great H1419 stone H0068: and the men H0582 of Bethshemesh H1053 offered H5927 (8689) burnt offerings H5930 and sacrificed H2076 (8799) sacrifices H2077 the same day H3117 unto the LORD H3068.
006:016 And when the five H2568 lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 had seen H7200 (8804) [it], they returned H7725 (8799) to Ekron H6138 the same day H3117.
006:017 And these [are] the golden H2091 emerods H2914 which the Philistines H6430 returned H7725 (8689) [for] a trespass offering H0817 unto the LORD H3068; for Ashdod H0795 one H0259, for Gaza H5804 one H0259, for Askelon H0831 one H0259, for Gath H1661 one H0259, for Ekron H6138 one H0259;
006:018 And the golden H2091 mice H5909, [according to] the number H4557 of all the cities H5892 of the Philistines H6430 [belonging] to the five H2568 lords H5633, [both] of fenced H4013 cities H5892, and of country H6521 villages H3724, even unto the great H1419 [stone of] Abel H0059, whereon they set down H3240 (8689) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068: [which stone remaineth] unto this day H3117 in the field H7704 of Joshua H3091, the Bethshemite H1030.
006:019 And he smote H5221 (8686) the men H0376 of Bethshemesh H1053, because they had looked H7200 (8804) into the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, even he smote H5221 (8686) of the people H5971 fifty H2572 thousand H0505 and threescore and ten H7657 men H0582: and the people H5971 lamented H0056 (8691), because the LORD H3068 had smitten H5221 (8689) [many] of the people H5971 with a great H1419 slaughter H4347.
006:020 And the men H0582 of Bethshemesh H1053 said H0559 (8799), Who is able H3201 (8799) to stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 this holy H6918 LORD H3068 God H0430? and to whom shall he go up H5927 (8799) from us?
006:021 And they sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Kirjathjearim H7157, saying H0559 (8800), The Philistines H6430 have brought again H7725 (8689) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068; come ye down H3381 (8798), [and] fetch it up H5927 (8685) to you.
007:001 ¶ And the men H0582 of Kirjathjearim H7157 came H0935 (8799), and fetched up H5927 (8686) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, and brought H0935 (8686) it into the house H1004 of Abinadab H0041 in the hill H1389, and sanctified H6942 (8765) Eleazar H0499 his son H1121 to keep H8104 (8800) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068.
007:002 And it came to pass, while H3117 the ark H0727 abode H3427 (8800) in Kirjathjearim H7157, that the time H3117 was long H7235 (8799); for it was twenty H6242 years H8141: and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 lamented H5091 (8735) after H0310 the LORD H3068.
007:003 And Samuel H8050 spake H0559 (8799) unto all the house H1004 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), If ye do return H7725 (8802) unto the LORD H3068 with all your hearts H3824, [then] put away H5493 (8685) the strange H5236 gods H0430 and Ashtaroth H6252 from among H8432 you, and prepare H3559 (8685) your hearts H3824 unto the LORD H3068, and serve H5647 (8798) him only: and he will deliver H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
007:004 Then the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did put away H5493 (8686) Baalim H1168 and Ashtaroth H6252, and served H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068 only.
007:005 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), Gather H6908 (8798) all Israel H3478 to Mizpeh H4708, and I will pray H6419 (8691) for you unto the LORD H3068.
007:006 And they gathered together H6908 (8735) to Mizpeh H4709, and drew H7579 (8799) water H4325, and poured [it] out H8210 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and fasted H6684 (8799) on that day H3117, and said H0559 (8799) there, We have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068. And Samuel H8050 judged H8199 (8799) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in Mizpeh H4708.
007:007 And when the Philistines H6430 heard H8085 (8799) that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were gathered together H6908 (8694) to Mizpeh H4708, the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 went up H5927 (8799) against Israel H3478. And when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8799) [it], they were afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 the Philistines H6430.
007:008 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) to Samuel H8050, Cease H2790 (8686) not to cry H2199 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430 for us, that he will save H3467 (8686) us out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
007:009 And Samuel H8050 took H3947 (8799) a H0259 sucking H2461 lamb H2924, and offered H5927 (8686) [it for] a burnt offering H5930 wholly H3632 unto the LORD H3068: and Samuel H8050 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 for Israel H3478; and the LORD H3068 heard H6030 (8799) him.
007:010 And as Samuel H8050 was offering up H5927 (8688) the burnt offering H5930, the Philistines H6430 drew near H5066 (8738) to battle H4421 against Israel H3478: but the LORD H3068 thundered H7481 (8686) with a great H1419 thunder H6963 on that day H3117 upon the Philistines H6430, and discomfited H2000 (8799) them; and they were smitten H5062 (8735) before H6440 Israel H3478.
007:011 And the men H0582 of Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8799) of Mizpeh H4709, and pursued H7291 (8799) the Philistines H6430, and smote H5221 (8686) them, until [they came] under Bethcar H1033.
007:012 Then Samuel H8050 took H3947 (8799) a H0259 stone H0068, and set H7760 (8799) [it] between Mizpeh H4709 and Shen H8129, and called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of it Ebenezer H0072, saying H0559 (8799), Hitherto hath the LORD H3068 helped H5826 (8804) us.
007:013 So the Philistines H6430 were subdued H3665 (8735), and they came H0935 (8800) no more H3254 (8804) into the coast H1366 of Israel H3478: and the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was against the Philistines H6430 all the days H3117 of Samuel H8050.
007:014 And the cities H5892 which the Philistines H6430 had taken H3947 (8804) from Israel H3478 were restored H7725 (8799) to Israel H3478, from Ekron H6138 even unto Gath H1661; and the coasts H1366 thereof did Israel H3478 deliver H5337 (8689) out of the hands H3027 of the Philistines H6430. And there was peace H7965 between Israel H3478 and the Amorites H0567.
007:015 And Samuel H8050 judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
007:016 And he went H1980 (8804) from H1767 year H8141 to year H8141 in circuit H5437 (8804) to Bethel H1008, and Gilgal H1537, and Mizpeh H4709, and judged H8199 (8804) Israel H3478 in all those places H4725.
007:017 And his return H8666 [was] to Ramah H7414; for there [was] his house H1004; and there he judged H8199 (8804) Israel H3478; and there he built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068.
008:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when Samuel H8050 was old H2204 (8804), that he made H7760 (8799) his sons H1121 judges H8199 (8802) over Israel H3478.
008:002 Now the name H8034 of his firstborn H1121 H1060 was Joel H3100; and the name H8034 of his second H4932, Abiah H0029: [they were] judges H8199 (8802) in Beersheba H0884.
008:003 And his sons H1121 walked H1980 (8804) not in his ways H1870, but turned aside H5186 (8799) after H0310 lucre H1215, and took H3947 (8799) bribes H7810, and perverted H5186 (8686) judgment H4941.
008:004 Then all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 gathered themselves together H6908 (8691), and came H0935 (8799) to Samuel H8050 unto Ramah H7414,
008:005 And said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, thou art old H2204 (8804), and thy sons H1121 walk H1980 (8804) not in thy ways H1870: now make H7760 (8798) us a king H4428 to judge H8199 (8800) us like all the nations H1471.
008:006 But the thing H1697 displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 Samuel H8050, when they said H0559 (8804), Give H5414 (8798) us a king H4428 to judge H8199 (8800) us. And Samuel H8050 prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068.
008:007 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Hearken H8085 (8798) unto the voice H6963 of the people H5971 in all that they say H0559 (8799) unto thee: for they have not rejected H3988 (8804) thee, but they have rejected H3988 (8804) me, that I should not reign H4427 (8800) over them.
008:008 According to all the works H4639 which they have done H6213 (8804) since the day H3117 that I brought them up H5927 (8687) out of Egypt H4714 even unto this day H3117, wherewith they have forsaken H5800 (8799) me, and served H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, so do H6213 (8802) they also unto thee.
008:009 Now therefore hearken H8085 (8798) unto their voice H6963: howbeit H0389 yet protest H5749 (8686) solemnly H5749 (8687) unto them, and shew H5046 (8689) them the manner H4941 of the king H4428 that shall reign H4427 (8799) over them.
008:010 And Samuel H8050 told H0559 (8799) all the words H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto the people H5971 that asked H7592 (8802) of him a king H4428.
008:011 And he said H0559 (8799), This will be the manner H4941 of the king H4428 that shall reign H4427 (8799) over you: He will take H3947 (8799) your sons H1121, and appoint H7760 (8804) [them] for himself, for his chariots H4818, and [to be] his horsemen H6571; and [some] shall run H7323 (8804) before H6440 his chariots H4818.
008:012 And he will appoint H7760 (8800) him captains H8269 over thousands H0505, and captains H8269 over fifties H2572; and [will set them] to ear H2790 (8800) his ground H2758, and to reap H7114 (8800) his harvest H7105, and to make H6213 (8800) his instruments H3627 of war H4421, and instruments H3627 of his chariots H7393.
008:013 And he will take H3947 (8799) your daughters H1323 [to be] confectionaries H7548, and [to be] cooks H2879, and [to be] bakers H0644 (8802).
008:014 And he will take H3947 (8799) your fields H7704, and your vineyards H3754, and your oliveyards H2132, [even] the best H2896 [of them], and give H5414 (8804) [them] to his servants H5650.
008:015 And he will take the tenth H6237 (8799) of your seed H2233, and of your vineyards H3754, and give H5414 (8804) to his officers H5631, and to his servants H5650.
008:016 And he will take H3947 (8799) your menservants H5650, and your maidservants H8198, and your goodliest H2896 young men H0970, and your asses H2543, and put H6213 (8804) [them] to his work H4399.
008:017 He will take the tenth H6237 (8799) of your sheep H6629: and ye shall be his servants H5650.
008:018 And ye shall cry out H2199 (8804) in that day H3117 because H6440 of your king H4428 which ye shall have chosen H0977 (8804) you; and the LORD H3068 will not hear H6030 (8799) you in that day H3117.
008:019 Nevertheless the people H5971 refused H3985 (8762) to obey H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 of Samuel H8050; and they said H0559 (8799), Nay; but we will have a king H4428 over us;
008:020 That we also may be like all the nations H1471; and that our king H4428 may judge H8199 (8804) us, and go out H3318 (8804) before H6440 us, and fight H3898 (8738) our battles H4421.
008:021 And Samuel H8050 heard H8085 (8799) all the words H1697 of the people H5971, and he rehearsed H1696 (8762) them in the ears H0241 of the LORD H3068.
008:022 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) to Samuel H8050, Hearken H8085 (8798) unto their voice H6963, and make H4427 (8689) them a king H4428. And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto the men H0582 of Israel H3478, Go H3212 (8798) ye every man H0376 unto his city H5892.
009:001 ¶ Now there was a man H0376 of Benjamin H1144, whose name H8034 [was] Kish H7027, the son H1121 of Abiel H0022, the son H1121 of Zeror H6872, the son H1121 of Bechorath H1064, the son H1121 of Aphiah H0647, a Benjamite H1145, a mighty H1368 man H0376 of power H2428.
009:002 And he had a son H1121, whose name H8034 [was] Saul H7586, a choice young man H0970, and a goodly H2896: and [there was] not among the children H1121 of Israel H3478 a goodlier H2896 person H0376 than he: from his shoulders H7926 and upward H4605 [he was] higher H1364 than any of the people H5971.
009:003 And the asses H0860 of Kish H7027 Saul’s H7586 father H0001 were lost H0006 (8799). And Kish H7027 said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586 his son H1121, Take H3947 (8798) now one H0259 of the servants H5288 with thee, and arise H6965 (8798), go H3212 (8798) seek H1245 (8761) the asses H0860.
009:004 And he passed through H5674 (8799) mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and passed through H5674 (8799) the land H0776 of Shalisha H8031, but they found H4672 (8804) [them] not: then they passed through H5674 (8799) the land H0776 of Shalim H8171, and [there they were] not: and he passed through H5674 (8799) the land H0776 of the Benjamites H1145, but they found H4672 (8804) [them] not.
009:005 [And] when they were come H0935 (8804) to the land H0776 of Zuph H6689, Saul H7586 said H0559 (8804) to his servant H5288 that [was] with him, Come H3212 (8798), and let us return H7725 (8799); lest my father H0001 leave H2308 (8799) [caring] for the asses H0860, and take thought H1672 (8804) for us.
009:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold now, [there is] in this city H5892 a man H0376 of God H0430, and [he is] an honourable H3513 (8737) man H0376; all that he saith H1696 (8762) cometh H0935 (8799) surely to pass H0935 (8800): now let us go H3212 (8799) thither; peradventure he can shew H5046 (8686) us our way H1870 that we should go H1980 (8804).
009:007 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586 to his servant H5288, But, behold, [if] we go H3212 (8799), what shall we bring H0935 (8686) the man H0376? for the bread H3899 is spent H0235 (8804) in our vessels H3627, and [there is] not a present H8670 to bring H0935 (8687) to the man H0376 of God H0430: what have we?
009:008 And the servant H5288 answered H6030 (8800) Saul H7586 again H3254 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I have H4672 (8738) here at hand H3027 the fourth part H7253 of a shekel H8255 of silver H3701: [that] will I give H5414 (8804) to the man H0376 of God H0430, to tell H5046 (8689) us our way H1870.
009:009 (Beforetime H6440 in Israel H3478, when a man H0376 went H3212 (8800) to enquire H1875 (8800) of God H0430, thus he spake H0559 (8804), Come H3212 (8798), and let us go H3212 (8799) to the seer H7200 (8802): for [he that is] now H3117 [called] a Prophet H5030 was beforetime H6440 called H7121 (8735) a Seer H7200 (8802).)
009:010 Then said H1697 Saul H7586 to his servant H5288, Well H2896 said H0559 (8799); come H3212 (8798), let us go H3212 (8799). So they went H3212 (8799) unto the city H5892 where the man H0376 of God H0430 [was].
009:011 [And] as they went up H5927 (8802) the hill H4608 to the city H5892, they found H4672 (8804) young maidens H5291 going out H3318 (8802) to draw H7579 (8800) water H4325, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Is H3426 the seer H7200 (8802) here?
009:012 And they answered H6030 (8799) them, and said H0559 (8799), He is H3426; behold, [he is] before H6440 you: make haste H4116 (8761) now, for he came H0935 (8804) to day H3117 to the city H5892; for [there is] a sacrifice H2077 of the people H5971 to day H3117 in the high place H1116:
009:013 As soon as ye be come H0935 (8800) into the city H5892, ye shall straightway H3651 find H4672 (8799) him, before he go up H5927 (8799) to the high place H1116 to eat H0398 (8800): for the people H5971 will not eat H0398 (8799) until he come H0935 (8800), because he doth bless H1288 (8762) the sacrifice H2077; [and] afterwards H0310 H3651 they eat H0398 (8799) that be bidden H7121 (8803). Now therefore get you up H5927 (8798); for about this time H3117 ye shall find H4672 (8799) him.
009:014 And they went up H5927 (8799) into H8432 the city H5892: [and] when they were come H0935 (8802) into the city H5892, behold, Samuel H8050 came out H3318 (8802) against H7125 (8800) them, for to go up H5927 (8800) to the high place H1116.
009:015 Now the LORD H3068 had told H1540 (8804) Samuel H8050 in his ear H0241 a H0259 day H3117 before H6440 Saul H7586 came H0935 (8800), saying H0559 (8800),
009:016 To morrow H4279 about this time H6256 I will send H7971 (8799) thee a man H0376 out of the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144, and thou shalt anoint H4886 (8804) him [to be] captain H5057 over my people H5971 Israel H3478, that he may save H3467 (8689) my people H5971 out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430: for I have looked H7200 (8804) upon my people H5971, because their cry H6818 is come H0935 (8804) unto me.
009:017 And when Samuel H8050 saw H7200 (8804) Saul H7586, the LORD H3068 said H6030 (8804) unto him, Behold the man H0376 whom I spake H0559 (8804) to thee of! this same shall reign H6113 (8799) over my people H5971.
009:018 Then Saul H7586 drew near H5066 (8799) to Samuel H8050 in H8432 the gate H8179, and said H0559 (8799), Tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee, where H0335 the seer’s H7200 (8802) house H1004 [is].
009:019 And Samuel H8050 answered H6030 (8799) Saul H7586, and said H0559 (8799), I [am] the seer H7200 (8802): go up H5927 (8798) before H6440 me unto the high place H1116; for ye shall eat H0398 (8804) with me to day H3117, and to morrow H1242 I will let thee go H7971 (8765), and will tell H5046 (8686) thee all that [is] in thine heart H3824.
009:020 And as for thine asses H0860 that were lost H0006 (8802) three H7969 days H3117 ago H3117, set H7760 (8799) not thy mind H3820 on them; for they are found H4672 (8738). And on whom [is] all the desire H2532 of Israel H3478? [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father’s H0001 house H1004?
009:021 And Saul H7586 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), [Am] not I a Benjamite H1145, of the smallest H6996 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478? and my family H4940 the least H6810 of all the families H4940 of the tribe H7626 of Benjamin H1144? wherefore then speakest H1696 (8765) thou so H1697 to me?
009:022 And Samuel H8050 took H3947 (8799) Saul H7586 and his servant H5288, and brought H0935 (8686) them into the parlour H3957, and made them sit H5414 (8799) in the chiefest H7218 place H4725 among them that were bidden H7121 (8803), which [were] about thirty H7970 persons H0376.
009:023 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto the cook H2876, Bring H5414 (8798) the portion H4490 which I gave H5414 (8804) thee, of which I said H0559 (8804) unto thee, Set H7760 (8798) it by thee.
009:024 And the cook H2876 took up H7311 (8686) the shoulder H7785, and [that] which [was] upon it, and set H7760 (8799) [it] before H6440 Saul H7586. And [Samuel] said H0559 (8799), Behold that which is left H7604 (8737)! set H7760 (8798) [it] before H6440 thee, [and] eat H0398 (8798): for unto this time H4150 hath it been kept H8104 (8803) for thee since I said H0559 (8800), I have invited H7121 (8804) the people H5971. So Saul H7586 did eat H0398 (8799) with Samuel H8050 that day H3117.
009:025 And when they were come down H3381 (8799) from the high place H1116 into the city H5892, [Samuel] communed H1696 (8762) with Saul H7586 upon the top of the house H1406.
009:026 And they arose early H7925 (8686): and it came to pass about the spring H5927 (8800) of the day H7837, that Samuel H8050 called H7121 (8799) Saul H7586 to the top of the house H1406, saying H0559 (8800), Up H6965 (8798), that I may send thee away H7971 (8762). And Saul H7586 arose H6965 (8799), and they went out H3318 (8799) both H8147 of them, he and Samuel H8050, abroad H2351.
009:027 [And] as they were going down H3381 (8802) to the end H7097 of the city H5892, Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8804) to Saul H7586, Bid H0559 (8798) the servant H5288 pass on H5674 (8799) before H6440 us, (and he passed on H5674 (8798),) but stand H5975 (8798) thou still a while H3117, that I may shew H8085 (8686) thee the word H1697 of God H0430.
010:001 ¶ Then Samuel H8050 took H3947 (8799) a vial H6378 of oil H8081, and poured H3332 (8799) [it] upon his head H7218, and kissed H5401 (8799) him, and said H0559 (8799), [Is it] not because the LORD H3068 hath anointed H4886 (8804) thee [to be] captain H5057 over his inheritance H5159?
010:002 When thou art departed H3212 (8800) from me H5978 to day H3117, then thou shalt find H4672 (8804) two H8147 men H0582 by Rachel’s H7354 sepulchre H6900 in the border H1366 of Benjamin H1144 at Zelzah H6766; and they will say H0559 (8804) unto thee, The asses H0860 which thou wentest H1980 (8804) to seek H1245 (8763) are found H4672 (8738): and, lo, thy father H0001 hath left H5203 (8804) the care H1697 of the asses H0860, and sorroweth H1672 (8804) for you, saying H0559 (8800), What shall I do H6213 (8799) for my son H1121?
010:003 Then shalt thou go on H2498 (8804) forward H1973 from thence, and thou shalt come H0935 (8804) to the plain H0436 of Tabor H8396, and there shall meet H4672 (8804) thee three H7969 men H0582 going up H5927 (8802) to God H0430 to Bethel H1008, one H0259 carrying H5375 (8802) three H7969 kids H1423, and another H0259 carrying H5375 (8802) three H7969 loaves H3603 of bread H3899, and another H0259 carrying H5375 (8802) a bottle H5035 of wine H3196:
010:004 And they will H7592 (8804) salute H7965 thee, and give H5414 (8804) thee two H8147 [loaves] of bread H3899; which thou shalt receive H3947 (8804) of their hands H3027.
010:005 After H0310 that thou shalt come H0935 (8799) to the hill H1389 of God H0430, where [is] the garrison H5333 of the Philistines H6430: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither H0935 (8800) to the city H5892, that thou shalt meet H6293 (8804) a company H2256 of prophets H5030 coming down H3381 (8802) from the high place H1116 with a psaltery H5035, and a tabret H8596, and a pipe H2485, and a harp H3658, before H6440 them; and they shall prophesy H5012 (8693):
010:006 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 will come H6743 (8804) upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy H5012 (8694) with them, and shalt be turned H2015 (8738) into another H0312 man H0376.
010:007 And let it be, when these signs H0226 are come H0935 (8799) unto thee, [that] thou do H6213 (8798) as occasion H4672 (8799) serve H3027 thee; for God H0430 [is] with thee.
010:008 And thou shalt go down H3381 (8804) before H6440 me to Gilgal H1537; and, behold, I will come down H3381 (8802) unto thee, to offer H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930, [and] to sacrifice H2076 (8800) sacrifices H2077 of peace offerings H8002: seven H7651 days H3117 shalt thou tarry H3176 (8686), till I come H0935 (8800) to thee, and shew H3045 (8689) thee what thou shalt do H6213 (8799).
010:009 And it was [so], that when he had turned H6437 (8687) his back H7926 to go H3212 (8800) from Samuel H8050, God H0430 gave H2015 (8799) him another H0312 heart H3820: and all those signs H0226 came H0935 (8799) to pass that day H3117.
010:010 And when they came H0935 (8799) thither to the hill H1389, behold, a company H2256 of prophets H5030 met H7125 (8800) him; and the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 came H6743 (8799) upon him, and he prophesied H5012 (8691) among H8432 them.
010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew H3045 (8802) him beforetime H0865 H8032 saw H7200 (8799) that, behold, he prophesied H5012 (8738) among the prophets H5030, then the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, What [is] this [that] is come unto the son H1121 of Kish H7027? [Is] Saul H7586 also among the prophets H5030?
010:012 And one H0376 of the same place answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), But who [is] their father H0001? Therefore it became a proverb H4912, [Is] Saul H7586 also among the prophets H5030?
010:013 And when he had made an end H3615 (8762) of prophesying H5012 (8692), he came H0935 (8799) to the high place H1116.
010:014 And Saul’s H7586 uncle H1730 said H0559 (8799) unto him and to his servant H5288, Whither H0575 went H1980 (8804) ye? And he said H0559 (8799), To seek H1245 (8763) the asses H0860: and when we saw H7200 (8799) that [they were] no where H0369, we came H0935 (8799) to Samuel H8050.
010:015 And Saul’s H7586 uncle H1730 said H0559 (8799), Tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee, what Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8804) unto you.
010:016 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto his uncle H1730, He told H5046 (8689) us plainly H5046 (8687) that the asses H0860 were found H4672 (8738). But of the matter H1697 of the kingdom H4410, whereof Samuel H8050 spake H0559 (8804), he told H5046 (8689) him not.
010:017 And Samuel H8050 called H6817 (8686) the people H5971 together unto the LORD H3068 to Mizpeh H4709;
010:018 And said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, I brought up H5927 (8689) Israel H3478 out of Egypt H4714, and delivered H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of the Egyptians H4714, and out of the hand H3027 of all kingdoms H4467, [and] of them that oppressed H3905 (8801) you:
010:019 And ye have this day H3117 rejected H3988 (8804) your God H0430, who himself saved H3467 (8688) you out of all your adversities H7451 and your tribulations H6869; and ye have said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Nay], but set H7760 (8799) a king H4428 over us. Now therefore present H3320 (8690) yourselves before H6440 the LORD H3068 by your tribes H7626, and by your thousands H0505.
010:020 And when Samuel H8050 had caused all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 to come near H7126 (8686), the tribe H7626 of Benjamin H1144 was taken H3920 (8735).
010:021 When he had caused the tribe H7626 of Benjamin H1144 to come near H7126 (8686) by their families H4940, the family H4940 of Matri H4309 was taken H3920 (8735), and Saul H7586 the son H1121 of Kish H7027 was taken H3920 (8735): and when they sought H1245 (8762) him, he could not be found H4672 (8738).
010:022 Therefore they enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068 further, if the man H0376 should yet come H0935 (8804) thither H1988. And the LORD H3068 answered H0559 (8799), Behold, he hath hid H2244 (8737) himself among the stuff H3627.
010:023 And they ran H7323 (8799) and fetched H3947 (8799) him thence: and when he stood H3320 (8691) among H8432 the people H5971, he was higher H1361 (8799) than any of the people H5971 from his shoulders H7926 and upward H4605.
010:024 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) to all the people H5971, See H7200 (8804) ye him whom the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804), that [there is] none like him among all the people H5971? And all the people H5971 shouted H7321 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), God save H2421 (8799) the king H4428.
010:025 Then Samuel H8050 told H1696 (8762) the people H5971 the manner H4941 of the kingdom H4410, and wrote H3789 (8799) [it] in a book H5612, and laid [it] up H3240 (8686) before H6440 the LORD H3068. And Samuel H8050 sent H7971 all the people H5971 away H7971 (8762), every man H0376 to his house H1004.
010:026 And Saul H7586 also went H1980 (8804) home H1004 to Gibeah H1390; and there went H3212 (8799) with him a band of men H2428, whose hearts H3820 God H0430 had touched H5060 (8804).
010:027 But the children H1121 of Belial H1100 said H0559 (8804), How shall this man save H3467 (8686) us? And they despised H0959 (8799) him, and brought H0935 (8689) him no presents H4503. But he held his peace H2790 (8688).
011:001 ¶ Then Nahash H5176 the Ammonite H5984 came up H5927 (8799), and encamped H2583 (8799) against Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568: and all the men H0582 of Jabesh H3003 said H0559 (8799) unto Nahash H5176, Make H3772 (8798) a covenant H1285 with us, and we will serve H5647 (8799) thee.
011:002 And Nahash H5176 the Ammonite H5984 answered H0559 (8799) them, On this H2063 [condition] will I make H3772 (8799) [a covenant] with you, that I may thrust out H5365 (8800) all your right H3225 eyes H5869, and lay H7760 (8804) it [for] a reproach H2781 upon all Israel H3478.
011:003 And the elders H2205 of Jabesh H3003 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Give us seven H7651 days H3117 ’ respite H7503 (8685), that we may send H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto all the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478: and then, if [there be] no man to save H3467 (8688) us, we will come out H3318 (8804) to thee.
011:004 Then came H0935 (8799) the messengers H4397 to Gibeah H1390 of Saul H7586, and told H1696 (8762) the tidings H1697 in the ears H0241 of the people H5971: and all the people H5971 lifted up H5375 (8799) their voices H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
011:005 And, behold, Saul H7586 came H0935 (8804) after H0310 the herd H1241 out of the field H7704; and Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), What [aileth] the people H5971 that they weep H1058 (8799)? And they told H5608 (8762) him the tidings H1697 of the men H0582 of Jabesh H3003.
011:006 And the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 came H6743 (8799) upon Saul H7586 when he heard H8085 (8800) those tidings H1697, and his anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) greatly H3966.
011:007 And he took H3947 (8799) a yoke H6776 of oxen H1241, and hewed them in pieces H5408 (8762), and sent H7971 (8762) [them] throughout all the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478 by the hands H3027 of messengers H4397, saying H0559 (8800), Whosoever cometh not forth H3318 (8802) after H0310 Saul H7586 and after H0310 Samuel H8050, so shall it be done H6213 (8735) unto his oxen H1241. And the fear H6343 of the LORD H3068 fell H5307 (8799) on the people H5971, and they came out H3318 (8799) with one H0259 consent H0376.
011:008 And when he numbered H6485 (8799) them in Bezek H0966, the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505, and the men H0376 of Judah H3063 thirty H7970 thousand H0505.
011:009 And they said H0559 (8799) unto the messengers H4397 that came H0935 (8802), Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) unto the men H0376 of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568, To morrow H4279, by [that time] the sun H8121 be hot H2527, ye shall have help H8668. And the messengers H4397 came H0935 (8799) and shewed H5046 (8686) [it] to the men H0582 of Jabesh H3003; and they were glad H8055 (8799).
011:010 Therefore the men H0582 of Jabesh H3003 said H0559 (8799), To morrow H4279 we will come out H3318 (8799) unto you, and ye shall do H6213 (8804) with us all that seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto you.
011:011 And it was [so] on the morrow H4283, that Saul H7586 put H7760 (8799) the people H5971 in three H7969 companies H7218; and they came H0935 (8799) into the midst H8432 of the host H4264 in the morning H1242 watch H0821, and slew H5221 (8686) the Ammonites H5983 until the heat H2527 of the day H3117: and it came to pass, that they which remained H7604 (8737) were scattered H6327 (8799), so that two H8147 of them were not left H7604 (8738) together H3162.
011:012 And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Who [is] he that said H0559 (8802), Shall Saul H7586 reign H4427 (8799) over us? bring H5414 (8798) the men H0582, that we may put them to death H4191 (8686).
011:013 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), There shall not a man H0376 be put to death H4191 (8714) this day H3117: for to day H3117 the LORD H3068 hath wrought H6213 (8804) salvation H8668 in Israel H3478.
011:014 Then said H0559 (8799) Samuel H8050 to the people H5971, Come H3212 (8798), and let us go H3212 (8799) to Gilgal H1537, and renew H2318 (8762) the kingdom H4410 there.
011:015 And all the people H5971 went H3212 (8799) to Gilgal H1537; and there they made Saul H7586 king H4427 (8686) before H6440 the LORD H3068 in Gilgal H1537; and there they sacrificed H2076 (8799) sacrifices H2077 of peace offerings H8002 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and there Saul H7586 and all the men H0582 of Israel H3478 rejoiced H8055 (8799) greatly H3966.
012:001 ¶ And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto all Israel H3478, Behold, I have hearkened H8085 (8804) unto your voice H6963 in all that ye said H0559 (8804) unto me, and have made H4427 (8686) a king H4428 over you.
012:002 And now, behold, the king H4428 walketh H1980 (8693) before H6440 you: and I am old H2204 (8804) and grayheaded H7867 (8804); and, behold, my sons H1121 [are] with you: and I have walked H1980 (8694) before H6440 you from my childhood H5271 unto this day H3117.
012:003 Behold, here I [am]: witness H6030 (8798) against me before the LORD H3068, and before his anointed H4899: whose ox H7794 have I taken H3947 (8804)? or whose ass H2543 have I taken H3947 (8804)? or whom have I defrauded H6231 (8804)? whom have I oppressed H7533 (8804)? or of whose hand H3027 have I received [any] bribe H3724 to blind H5956 (8686) mine eyes H5869 therewith? and I will restore H7725 (8686) it you.
012:004 And they said H0559 (8799), Thou hast not defrauded H6231 (8804) us, nor oppressed H7533 (8804) us, neither hast thou taken H3947 (8804) ought H3972 of any man’s H0376 hand H3027.
012:005 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, The LORD H3068 [is] witness H5707 against you, and his anointed H4899 [is] witness H5707 this day H3117, that ye have not found H4672 (8804) ought H3972 in my hand H3027. And they answered H0559 (8799), [He is] witness H5707.
012:006 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, [It is] the LORD H3068 that advanced H6213 (8804) Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175, and that brought H5927 your fathers H0001 up H5927 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
012:007 Now therefore stand still H3320 (8690), that I may reason H8199 (8735) with you before H6440 the LORD H3068 of all the righteous acts H6666 of the LORD H3068, which he did H6213 (8804) to you and to your fathers H0001.
012:008 When Jacob H3290 was come H0935 (8804) into Egypt H4714, and your fathers H0001 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, then the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175, which brought forth H3318 (8686) your fathers H0001 out of Egypt H4714, and made them dwell H3427 (8686) in this place H4725.
012:009 And when they forgat H7911 (8799) the LORD H3068 their God H0430, he sold H4376 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Sisera H5516, captain H8269 of the host H6635 of Hazor H2674, and into the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430, and into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Moab H4124, and they fought H3898 (8735) against them.
012:010 And they cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), We have sinned H2398 (8804), because we have forsaken H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068, and have served H5647 (8799) Baalim H1168 and Ashtaroth H6252: but now deliver H5337 (8685) us out of the hand H3027 of our enemies H0341 (8802), and we will serve H5647 (8799) thee.
012:011 And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) Jerubbaal H3378, and Bedan H0917, and Jephthah H3316, and Samuel H8050, and delivered H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of your enemies H0341 (8802) on every side H5439, and ye dwelled H3427 (8799) safe H0983.
012:012 And when ye saw H7200 (8799) that Nahash H5176 the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 came H0935 (8804) against you, ye said H0559 (8799) unto me, Nay; but a king H4428 shall reign H4427 (8799) over us: when the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [was] your king H4428.
012:013 Now therefore behold the king H4428 whom ye have chosen H0977 (8804), [and] whom ye have desired H7592 (8804)! and, behold, the LORD H3068 hath set H5414 (8804) a king H4428 over you.
012:014 If ye will fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068, and serve H5647 (8804) him, and obey H8085 (8804) his voice H6963, and not rebel H4784 (8686) against the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, then shall both ye and also the king H4428 that reigneth H4427 (8804) over you continue following H0310 the LORD H3068 your God H0430:
012:015 But if ye will not obey H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, but rebel H4784 (8804) against the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, then shall the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 be against you, as [it was] against your fathers H0001.
012:016 Now therefore H1571 stand H3320 (8690) and see H7200 (8798) this great H1419 thing H1697, which the LORD H3068 will do H6213 (8802) before your eyes H5869.
012:017 [Is it] not wheat H2406 harvest H7105 to day H3117? I will call H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, and he shall send H5414 (8799) thunder H6963 and rain H4306; that ye may perceive H3045 (8798) and see H7200 (8798) that your wickedness H7451 [is] great H7227, which ye have done H6213 (8804) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, in asking H7592 (8800) you a king H4428.
012:018 So Samuel H8050 called H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068; and the LORD H3068 sent H5414 (8799) thunder H6963 and rain H4306 that day H3117: and all the people H5971 greatly H3966 feared H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068 and Samuel H8050.
012:019 And all the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Pray H6419 (8690) for thy servants H5650 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, that we die H4191 (8799) not: for we have added H3254 (8804) unto all our sins H2403 [this] evil H7451, to ask H7592 (8800) us a king H4428.
012:020 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Fear H3372 (8799) not: ye have done H6213 (8804) all this wickedness H7451: yet turn not aside H5493 (8799) from following H0310 the LORD H3068, but serve H5647 (8804) the LORD H3068 with all your heart H3824;
012:021 And turn ye not aside H5493 (8799): for [then should ye go] after H0310 vain H8414 [things], which cannot profit H3276 (8686) nor deliver H5337 (8686); for they [are] vain H8414.
012:022 For the LORD H3068 will not forsake H5203 (8799) his people H5971 for his great H1419 name’s H8034 sake: because it hath pleased H2974 (8689) the LORD H3068 to make H6213 (8800) you his people H5971.
012:023 Moreover as for me H0595, God forbid H2486 that I should sin H2398 (8800) against the LORD H3068 in ceasing H2308 (8800) to pray H6419 (8692) for you: but I will teach H3384 (8689) you the good H2896 and the right H3477 way H1870:
012:024 Only fear H3372 (8798) the LORD H3068, and serve H5647 (8804) him in truth H0571 with all your heart H3824: for consider H7200 (8798) how great [things] he hath done H1431 (8689) for you.
012:025 But if ye shall still H7489 (8687) do wickedly H7489 (8686), ye shall be consumed H5595 (8735), both ye and your king H4428.
013:001 ¶ Saul H7586 reigned H4427 (8800) one year H1121 H8141; and when he had reigned H4427 (8804) two H8147 years H8141 over Israel H3478,
013:002 Saul H7586 chose H0977 (8799) him three H7969 thousand H0505 [men] of Israel H3478; [whereof] two thousand H0505 were with Saul H7586 in Michmash H4363 and in mount H2022 Bethel H1008, and a thousand H0505 were with Jonathan H3129 in Gibeah H1390 of Benjamin H1144: and the rest H3499 of the people H5971 he sent H7971 (8765) every man H0376 to his tent H0168.
013:003 And Jonathan H3129 smote H5221 (8686) the garrison H5333 of the Philistines H6430 that [was] in Geba H1387, and the Philistines H6430 heard H8085 (8799) [of it]. And Saul H7586 blew H8628 (8804) the trumpet H7782 throughout all the land H0776, saying H0559 (8800), Let the Hebrews H5680 hear H8085 (8799).
013:004 And all Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8804) say H0559 (8800) [that] Saul H7586 had smitten H5221 (8689) a garrison H5333 of the Philistines H6430, and [that] Israel H3478 also was had in abomination H0887 (8738) with the Philistines H6430. And the people H5971 were called together H6817 (8735) after H0310 Saul H7586 to Gilgal H1537.
013:005 And the Philistines H6430 gathered themselves together H0622 (8738) to fight H3898 (8736) with Israel H3478, thirty H7970 thousand H0505 chariots H7393, and six H8337 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571, and people H5971 as the sand H2344 which [is] on the sea H3220 shore H8193 in multitude H7230: and they came up H5927 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in Michmash H4363, eastward H6926 from Bethaven H1007.
013:006 When the men H0376 of Israel H3478 saw H7200 (8804) that they were in a strait H6887 (8804), (for the people H5971 were distressed H5065 (8738),) then the people H5971 did hide H2244 (8691) themselves in caves H4631, and in thickets H2337, and in rocks H5553, and in high places H6877, and in pits H0953.
013:007 And [some of] the Hebrews H5680 went over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383 to the land H0776 of Gad H1410 and Gilead H1568. As for Saul H7586, he [was] yet in Gilgal H1537, and all the people H5971 followed H0310 him trembling H2729 (8804).
013:008 And he tarried H3176 (8686) (8675) H3176 (8735) seven H7651 days H3117, according to the set time H4150 that Samuel H8050 [had appointed]: but Samuel H8050 came H0935 (8804) not to Gilgal H1537; and the people H5971 were scattered H6327 (8686) from him.
013:009 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Bring hither H5066 (8685) a burnt offering H5930 to me, and peace offerings H8002. And he offered H5927 (8686) the burnt offering H5930.
013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end H3615 (8763) of offering H5927 (8687) the burnt offering H5930, behold, Samuel H8050 came H0935 (8802); and Saul H7586 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, that he might salute H1288 (8800) him.
013:011 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), What hast thou done H6213 (8804)? And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Because I saw H7200 (8804) that the people H5971 were scattered H5310 (8804) from me, and [that] thou camest H0935 (8804) not within the days H3117 appointed H4150, and [that] the Philistines H6430 gathered themselves together H0622 (8737) at Michmash H4363;
013:012 Therefore said H0559 (8799) I, The Philistines H6430 will come down H3381 (8799) now upon me to Gilgal H1537, and I have not made supplication H2470 (8765) unto H6440 the LORD H3068: I forced H0662 (8691) myself therefore, and offered H5927 (8686) a burnt offering H5930.
013:013 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, Thou hast done foolishly H5528 (8738): thou hast not kept H8104 (8804) the commandment H4687 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which he commanded H6680 (8765) thee: for now would the LORD H3068 have established H3559 (8689) thy kingdom H4467 upon Israel H3478 for H5704 ever H5769.
013:014 But now thy kingdom H4467 shall not continue H6965 (8799): the LORD H3068 hath sought H1245 (8765) him a man H0376 after his own heart H3824, and the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8762) him [to be] captain H5057 over his people H5971, because thou hast not kept H8104 (8804) [that] which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) thee.
013:015 And Samuel H8050 arose H6965 (8799), and gat him up H5927 (8799) from Gilgal H1537 unto Gibeah H1390 of Benjamin H1144. And Saul H7586 numbered H6485 (8799) the people H5971 [that were] present H4672 (8737) with him, about six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376.
013:016 And Saul H7586, and Jonathan H3129 his son H1121, and the people H5971 [that were] present H4672 (8737) with them, abode H3427 (8802) in Gibeah H1387 of Benjamin H1144: but the Philistines H6430 encamped H2583 (8804) in Michmash H4363.
013:017 And the spoilers H7843 (8688) came out H3318 (8799) of the camp H4264 of the Philistines H6430 in three H7969 companies H7218: one H0259 company H7218 turned H6437 (8799) unto the way H1870 [that leadeth to] Ophrah H6084, unto the land H0776 of Shual H7777:
013:018 And another H0259 company H7218 turned H6437 (8799) the way H1870 [to] Bethhoron H1032: and another H0259 company H7218 turned H6437 (8799) [to] the way H1870 of the border H1366 that looketh H8259 (8737) to the valley H1516 of Zeboim H6650 toward the wilderness H4057.
013:019 Now there was no smith H2796 found H4672 (8735) throughout all the land H0776 of Israel H3478: for the Philistines H6430 said H0559 (8804), Lest the Hebrews H5680 make H6213 (8799) [them] swords H2719 or spears H2595:
013:020 But all the Israelites H3478 went down H3381 (8799) to the Philistines H6430, to sharpen H3913 (8800) every man H0376 his share H4282, and his coulter H0855, and his axe H7134, and his mattock H4281.
013:021 Yet they had a file H6477 H6310 for the mattocks H4281, and for the coulters H0855, and for the forks H7969 H7053, and for the axes H7134, and to sharpen H5324 (8687) the goads H1861.
013:022 So it came to pass in the day H3117 of battle H4421, that there was neither sword H2719 nor spear H2595 found H4672 (8738) in the hand H3027 of any of the people H5971 that [were] with Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3129: but with Saul H7586 and with Jonathan H3129 his son H1121 was there found H4672 (8735).
013:023 And the garrison H4673 of the Philistines H6430 went out H3318 (8799) to the passage H4569 of Michmash H4363.
014:001 ¶ Now it came to pass upon a day H3117, that Jonathan H3129 the son H1121 of Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto the young man H5288 that bare H5375 (8802) his armour H3627, Come H3212 (8798), and let us go over H5674 (8799) to the Philistines H6430 ’ garrison H4673, that [is] on the other side H5676 H1975. But he told H5046 (8689) not his father H0001.
014:002 And Saul H7586 tarried H3427 (8802) in the uttermost H7097 part of Gibeah H1390 under a pomegranate tree H7416 which [is] in Migron H4051: and the people H5971 that [were] with him [were] about six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376;
014:003 And Ahiah H0281, the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285, Ichabod’s H0350 brother H0251, the son H1121 of Phinehas H6372, the son H1121 of Eli H5941, the LORD’S H3068 priest H3548 in Shiloh H7887, wearing H5375 (8802) an ephod H0646. And the people H5971 knew H3045 (8804) not that Jonathan H3129 was gone H1980 (8804).
014:004 And between the passages H4569, by which Jonathan H3129 sought H1245 (8765) to go over H5674 (8800) unto the Philistines H6430 ’ garrison H4673, [there was] a sharp H8127 rock H5553 on the one side H5676, and a sharp H8127 rock H5553 on the other side H5676: and the name H8034 of the one H0259 [was] Bozez H0949, and the name H8034 of the other H0259 Seneh H5573.
014:005 The forefront H8127 of the one H0259 [was] situate H4690 northward H6828 over against H4136 Michmash H4363, and the other H0259 southward H5045 over against H4136 Gibeah H1387.
014:006 And Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799) to the young man H5288 that bare H5375 (8802) his armour H3627, Come H3212 (8798), and let us go over H5674 (8799) unto the garrison H4673 of these uncircumcised H6189: it may be that the LORD H3068 will work H6213 (8799) for us: for [there is] no restraint H4622 to the LORD H3068 to save H3467 (8687) by many H7227 or by few H4592.
014:007 And his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Do H6213 (8798) all that [is] in thine heart H3824: turn H5186 (8798) thee; behold, I [am] with thee according to thy heart H3824.
014:008 Then said H0559 (8799) Jonathan H3083, Behold, we will pass over H5674 (8802) unto [these] men H0582, and we will discover H1540 (8738) ourselves unto them.
014:009 If they say H0559 (8799) thus unto us, Tarry H1826 (8798) until we come H5060 (8687) to you; then we will stand still H5975 (8804) in our place, and will not go up H5927 (8799) unto them.
014:010 But if they say H0559 (8799) thus, Come up H5927 (8798) unto us; then we will go up H5927 (8804): for the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) them into our hand H3027: and this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto us.
014:011 And both H8147 of them discovered H1540 (8735) themselves unto the garrison H4673 of the Philistines H6430: and the Philistines H6430 said H0559 (8799), Behold, the Hebrews H5680 come forth H3318 (8802) out of the holes H2356 where they had hid H2244 (8694) themselves.
014:012 And the men H0582 of the garrison H4675 answered H6030 (8799) Jonathan H3129 and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, and said H0559 (8799), Come up H5927 (8798) to us, and we will shew H3045 (8686) you a thing H1697. And Jonathan H3129 said H0559 (8799) unto his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, Come up H5927 (8798) after H0310 me: for the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) them into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478.
014:013 And Jonathan H3129 climbed up H5927 (8799) upon his hands H3027 and upon his feet H7272, and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 after H0310 him: and they fell H5307 (8799) before H6440 Jonathan H3129; and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 slew H4191 (8789) after H0310 him.
014:014 And that first H7223 slaughter H4347, which Jonathan H3129 and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 made H5221 (8689), was about twenty H6242 men H0376, within as it were an half H2677 acre H4618 of land H7704, [which] a yoke H6776 [of oxen might plow].
014:015 And there was trembling H2731 in the host H4264, in the field H7704, and among all the people H5971: the garrison H4673, and the spoilers H7843 (8688), they also trembled H2729 (8804), and the earth H0776 quaked H7264 (8799): so it was a very great H0430 trembling H2731.
014:016 And the watchmen H6822 (8802) of Saul H7586 in Gibeah H1390 of Benjamin H1144 looked H7200 (8799); and, behold, the multitude H1995 melted away H4127 (8738), and they went H3212 (8799) on beating down H1986 (8800) [one another].
014:017 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586 unto the people H5971 that [were] with him, Number H6485 (8798) now, and see H7200 (8798) who is gone H1980 (8804) from us. And when they had numbered H6485 (8799), behold, Jonathan H3129 and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 [were] not [there].
014:018 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto Ahiah H0281, Bring hither H5066 (8685) the ark H0727 of God H0430. For the ark H0727 of God H0430 was at that time H3117 with the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul H7586 talked H1696 (8765) unto the priest H3548, that the noise H1995 that [was] in the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430 went H3212 (8799) on H1980 (8800) and increased H7227: and Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto the priest H3548, Withdraw H0622 (8798) thine hand H3027.
014:020 And Saul H7586 and all the people H5971 that [were] with him assembled H2199 (8735) themselves, and they came H0935 (8799) to the battle H4421: and, behold, every man’s H0376 sword H2719 was against his fellow H7453, [and there was] a very H3966 great H1419 discomfiture H4103.
014:021 Moreover the Hebrews H5680 [that] were with the Philistines H6430 before H0865 that time H8032, which went up H5927 (8804) with them into the camp H4264 [from the country] round about H5439, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites H3478 that [were] with Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3129.
014:022 Likewise all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 which had hid H2244 (8693) themselves in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, [when] they heard H8085 (8804) that the Philistines H6430 fled H5127 (8804), even they also followed hard H1692 (8686) after H0310 them in the battle H4421.
014:023 So the LORD H3068 saved H3467 (8686) Israel H3478 that day H3117: and the battle H4421 passed over H5674 (8804) unto Bethaven H1007.
014:024 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 were distressed H5065 (8738) that day H3117: for Saul H7586 had adjured H0422 (8686) the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H0376 that eateth H0398 (8799) [any] food H3899 until evening H6153, that I may be avenged H5358 (8738) on mine enemies H0341 (8802). So none of the people H5971 tasted H2938 (8804) [any] food H3899.
014:025 And all [they of] the land H0776 came H0935 (8804) to a wood H3293; and there was honey H1706 upon H6440 the ground H7704.
014:026 And when the people H5971 were come H0935 (8799) into the wood H3293, behold, the honey H1706 dropped H1982; but no man put H5381 (8688) his hand H3027 to his mouth H6310: for the people H5971 feared H3372 (8804) the oath H7621.
014:027 But Jonathan H3129 heard H8085 (8804) not when his father H0001 charged H7650 the people H5971 with the oath H7650 (8687): wherefore he put forth H7971 (8799) the end H7097 of the rod H4294 that [was] in his hand H3027, and dipped H2881 (8799) it in an honeycomb H3295 H1706, and put H7725 (8686) his hand H3027 to his mouth H6310; and his eyes H5869 were enlightened H0215 (8799).
014:028 Then answered H6030 (8799) one H0376 of the people H5971, and said H0559 (8799), Thy father H0001 straitly H7650 (8687) charged H7650 the people H5971 with an oath H7650 (8689), saying H0559 (8800), Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H0376 that eateth H0398 (8799) [any] food H3899 this day H3117. And the people H5971 were faint H5774 (8799).
014:029 Then said H0559 (8799) Jonathan H3129, My father H0001 hath troubled H5916 (8804) the land H0776: see H7200 (8798), I pray you, how mine eyes H5869 have been enlightened H0215 (8804), because I tasted H2938 (8804) a little H4592 of this honey H1706.
014:030 How much more H0637, if haply H3863 the people H5971 had eaten H0398 (8804) freely H0398 (8800) to day H3117 of the spoil H7998 of their enemies H0341 (8802) which they found H4672 (8804)? for had there not been now a much greater H7235 (8804) slaughter H4347 among the Philistines H6430?
014:031 And they smote H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430 that day H3117 from Michmash H4363 to Aijalon H0357: and the people H5971 were very H3966 faint H5774 (8799).
014:032 And the people H5971 flew H5860 (8799) H6213 (8799) upon the spoil H7998, and took H3947 (8799) sheep H6629, and oxen H1241, and calves H1121, and slew H7819 (8799) [them] on the ground H0776: and the people H5971 did eat H0398 (8799) [them] with the blood H1818.
014:033 Then they told H5046 (8686) Saul H7586, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, the people H5971 sin H2398 (8802) against the LORD H3068, in that they eat H0398 (8800) with the blood H1818. And he said H0559 (8799), Ye have transgressed H0898 (8804): roll H1556 (8798) a great H1419 stone H0068 unto me this day H3117.
014:034 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Disperse H6327 (8798) yourselves among the people H5971, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Bring me hither H5066 (8685) every man H0376 his ox H7794, and every man H0376 his sheep H7716, and slay H7819 (8804) [them] here, and eat H0398 (8804); and sin H2398 (8799) not against the LORD H3068 in eating H0398 (8800) with the blood H1818. And all the people H5971 brought H5066 (8686) every man H0376 his ox H7794 with him H3027 that night H3915, and slew H7819 (8799) [them] there.
014:035 And Saul H7586 built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068: the same was the first H2490 (8689) altar H4196 that he built H1129 (8800) unto the LORD H3068.
014:036 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Let us go down H3381 (8799) after H0310 the Philistines H6430 by night H3915, and spoil H0962 (8799) them until the morning H1242 light H0216, and let us not leave H7604 (8686) a man H0376 of them. And they said H0559 (8799), Do H6213 (8798) whatsoever seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto thee. Then said H0559 (8799) the priest H3548, Let us draw near H7126 (8799) hither H1988 unto God H0430.
014:037 And Saul H7586 asked H7592 (8799) counsel of God H0430, Shall I go down H3381 (8799) after H0310 the Philistines H6430? wilt thou deliver H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478? But he answered H6030 (8804) him not that day H3117.
014:038 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Draw ye near H5066 (8798) hither H1988, all the chief H6438 of the people H5971: and know H3045 (8798) and see H7200 (8798) wherein H4100 this sin H2403 hath been this day H3117.
014:039 For, [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, which saveth H3467 (8688) Israel H3478, though it be H3426 in Jonathan H3129 my son H1121, he shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799). But [there was] not a man among all the people H5971 [that] answered H6030 (8802) him.
014:040 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto all Israel H3478, Be ye on one H0259 side H5676, and I and Jonathan H3129 my son H1121 will be on the other H0259 side H5676. And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, Do H6213 (8798) what seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto thee.
014:041 Therefore Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Give H3051 (8798) a perfect H8549 [lot]. And Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3129 were taken H3920 (8735): but the people H5971 escaped H3318 (8804).
014:042 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Cast H5307 (8685) [lots] between me and Jonathan H3129 my son H1121. And Jonathan H3129 was taken H3920 (8735).
014:043 Then Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to Jonathan H3129, Tell H5046 (8685) me what thou hast done H6213 (8804). And Jonathan H3129 told H5046 (8686) him, and said H0559 (8799), I did but H2938 (8800) taste H2938 (8804) a little H4592 honey H1706 with the end H7097 of the rod H4294 that [was] in mine hand H3027, [and], lo H2009, I must die H4191 (8799).
014:044 And Saul H7586 answered H0559 (8799), God H0430 do so H6213 (8799) and more also H3254 (8686): for thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799), Jonathan H3129.
014:045 And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, Shall Jonathan H3129 die H4191 (8799), who hath wrought H6213 (8804) this great H1419 salvation H3444 in Israel H3478? God forbid H2486: [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, there shall not one hair H8185 of his head H7218 fall H5307 (8799) to the ground H0776; for he hath wrought H6213 (8804) with God H0430 this day H3117. So the people H5971 rescued H6299 (8799) Jonathan H3129, that he died H4191 (8804) not.
014:046 Then Saul H7586 went up H5927 (8799) from following H0310 the Philistines H6430: and the Philistines H6430 went H1980 (8804) to their own place H4725.
014:047 So Saul H7586 took H3920 (8804) the kingdom H4410 over Israel H3478, and fought H3898 (8735) against all his enemies H0341 (8802) on every side H5439, against Moab H4124, and against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and against Edom H0123, and against the kings H4428 of Zobah H6678, and against the Philistines H6430: and whithersoever he turned H6437 (8799) himself, he vexed H7561 (8686) [them].
014:048 And he gathered H6213 (8799) an host H2428, and smote H5221 (8686) the Amalekites H6002, and delivered H5337 (8686) Israel H3478 out of the hands H3027 of them that spoiled H8154 (8802) them.
014:049 Now the sons H1121 of Saul H7586 were Jonathan H3129, and Ishui H3440, and Melchishua H4444: and the names H8034 of his two H8147 daughters H1323 [were these]; the name H8034 of the firstborn H1067 Merab H4764, and the name H8034 of the younger H6996 Michal H4324:
014:050 And the name H8034 of Saul’s H7586 wife H0802 [was] Ahinoam H0293, the daughter H1323 of Ahimaaz H0290: and the name H8034 of the captain H8269 of his host H6635 [was] Abner H0074, the son H1121 of Ner H5369, Saul’s H7586 uncle H1730.
014:051 And Kish H7027 [was] the father H0001 of Saul H7586; and Ner H5369 the father H0001 of Abner H0074 [was] the son H1121 of Abiel H0022.
014:052 And there was sore H2389 war H4421 against the Philistines H6430 all the days H3117 of Saul H7586: and when Saul H7586 saw H7200 (8804) any strong H1368 man H0376, or any valiant H2428 man H1121, he took H0622 (8799) him unto him.
015:001 ¶ Samuel H8050 also said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, The LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8804) me to anoint H4886 (8800) thee [to be] king H4428 over his people H5971, over Israel H3478: now therefore hearken H8085 (8798) thou unto the voice H6963 of the words H1697 of the LORD H3068.
015:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, I remember H6485 (8804) [that] which Amalek H6002 did H6213 (8804) to Israel H3478, how he laid H7760 (8804) [wait] for him in the way H1870, when he came up H5927 (8800) from Egypt H4714.
015:003 Now go H3212 (8798) and smite H5221 (8689) Amalek H6002, and utterly destroy H2763 (8689) all that they have, and spare H2550 (8799) them not; but slay H4191 (8689) both man H0376 and woman H0802, infant H5768 and suckling H3243 (8802), ox H7794 and sheep H7716, camel H1581 and ass H2543.
015:004 And Saul H7586 gathered H8085 the people H5971 together H8085 (8762), and numbered H6485 (8799) them in Telaim H2923, two hundred H3967 thousand H0505 footmen H7273, and ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376 of Judah H3063.
015:005 And Saul H7586 came H0935 (8799) to a city H5892 of Amalek H6002, and laid wait H7378 (8799) H0693 (8686) in the valley H5158.
015:006 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto the Kenites H7017, Go H3212 (8798), depart H5493 (8798), get you down H3381 (8798) from among H8432 the Amalekites H6002, lest I destroy H0622 (8799) you with them: for ye shewed H6213 (8804) kindness H2617 to all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, when they came up H5927 (8800) out of Egypt H4714. So the Kenites H7017 departed H5493 (8799) from among H8432 the Amalekites H6003.
015:007 And Saul H7586 smote H5221 (8686) the Amalekites H6002 from Havilah H2341 [until] thou comest H0935 (8800) to Shur H7793, that [is] over against H6440 Egypt H4714.
015:008 And he took H8610 (8799) Agag H0090 the king H4428 of the Amalekites H6002 alive H2416, and utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) all the people H5971 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
015:009 But Saul H7586 and the people H5971 spared H2550 (8799) Agag H0090, and the best H4315 of the sheep H6629, and of the oxen H1241, and of the fatlings H4932, and the lambs H3733, and all [that was] good H2896, and would H0014 (8804) not utterly destroy H2763 (8687) them: but every thing H4399 [that was] vile H5240 and refuse H4549 (8738), that they destroyed utterly H2763 (8689).
015:010 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto Samuel H8050, saying H0559 (8800),
015:011 It repenteth H5162 (8738) me that I have set up H4427 (8689) Saul H7586 [to be] king H4428: for he is turned back H7725 (8804) from following H0310 me, and hath not performed H6965 (8689) my commandments H1697. And it grieved H2734 (8799) Samuel H8050; and he cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 all night H3915.
015:012 And when Samuel H8050 rose early H7925 (8686) to meet H7125 (8800) Saul H7586 in the morning H1242, it was told H5046 (8714) Samuel H8050, saying H0559 (8800), Saul H7586 came H0935 (8804) to Carmel H3760, and, behold, he set him up H5324 (8688) a place H3027, and is gone about H5437 (8735), and passed on H5674 (8799), and gone down H3381 (8799) to Gilgal H1537.
015:013 And Samuel H8050 came H0935 (8799) to Saul H7586: and Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] thou of the LORD H3068: I have performed H6965 (8689) the commandment H1697 of the LORD H3068.
015:014 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), What [meaneth] then this bleating H6963 of the sheep H6629 in mine ears H0241, and the lowing H6963 of the oxen H1241 which I hear H8085 (8802)?
015:015 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), They have brought H0935 (8689) them from the Amalekites H6003: for the people H5971 spared H2550 (8804) the best H4315 of the sheep H6629 and of the oxen H1241, to sacrifice H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430; and the rest H3498 (8802) we have utterly destroyed H2763 (8689).
015:016 Then Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, Stay H7503 (8685), and I will tell H5046 (8686) thee what the LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765) to me this night H3915. And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Say on H1696 (8761).
015:017 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), When thou [wast] little H6996 in thine own sight H5869, [wast] thou not [made] the head H7218 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, and the LORD H3068 anointed H4886 (8799) thee king H4428 over Israel H3478?
015:018 And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) thee on a journey H1870, and said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798) and utterly destroy H2763 (8689) the sinners H2400 the Amalekites H6002, and fight H3898 (8738) against them until they be consumed H3615 (8763).
015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, but didst fly H5860 (8799) upon the spoil H7998, and didst H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068?
015:020 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Yea, I have obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, and have gone H3212 (8799) the way H1870 which the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8804) me, and have brought H0935 (8686) Agag H0090 the king H4428 of Amalek H6002, and have utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) the Amalekites H6002.
015:021 But the people H5971 took H3947 (8799) of the spoil H7998, sheep H6629 and oxen H1241, the chief H7225 of the things which should have been utterly destroyed H2764, to sacrifice H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in Gilgal H1537.
015:022 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), Hath the LORD H3068 [as great] delight H2656 in burnt offerings H5930 and sacrifices H2077, as in obeying H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068? Behold, to obey H8085 (8800) [is] better H2896 than sacrifice H2077, [and] to hearken H7181 (8687) than the fat H2459 of rams H0352.
015:023 For rebellion H4805 [is as] the sin H2403 of witchcraft H7081, and stubbornness H6484 (8687) [is as] iniquity H0205 and idolatry H8655. Because thou hast rejected H3988 (8804) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, he hath also rejected H3988 (8799) thee from [being] king H4428.
015:024 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, I have sinned H2398 (8804): for I have transgressed H5674 (8804) the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, and thy words H1697: because I feared H3372 (8804) the people H5971, and obeyed H8085 (8799) their voice H6963.
015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon H5375 (8798) my sin H2403, and turn again H7725 (8798) with me, that I may worship H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068.
015:026 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, I will not return H7725 (8799) with thee: for thou hast rejected H3988 (8804) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, and the LORD H3068 hath rejected H3988 (8799) thee from being king H4428 over Israel H3478.
015:027 And as Samuel H8050 turned about H5437 (8735) to go away H3212 (8800), he laid hold H2388 (8686) upon the skirt H3671 of his mantle H4598, and it rent H7167 (8735).
015:028 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto him, The LORD H3068 hath rent H7167 (8804) the kingdom H4468 of Israel H3478 from thee this day H3117, and hath given H5414 (8804) it to a neighbour H7453 of thine, [that is] better H2896 than thou.
015:029 And also the Strength H5331 of Israel H3478 will not lie H8266 (8762) nor repent H5162 (8735): for he [is] not a man H0120, that he should repent H5162 (8736).
015:030 Then he said H0559 (8799), I have sinned H2398 (8804): [yet] honour H3513 (8761) me now, I pray thee, before the elders H2205 of my people H5971, and before Israel H3478, and turn again H7725 (8798) with me, that I may worship H7812 (8694) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
015:031 So Samuel H8050 turned again H7725 (8799) after H0310 Saul H7586; and Saul H7586 worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068.
015:032 Then said H0559 (8799) Samuel H8050, Bring ye hither H5066 (8685) to me Agag H0090 the king H4428 of the Amalekites H6002. And Agag H0090 came H3212 (8799) unto him delicately H4574. And Agag H0090 said H0559 (8799), Surely H0403 the bitterness H4751 of death H4194 is past H5493 (8804).
015:033 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), As thy sword H2719 hath made women H0802 childless H7921 (8765), so shall thy mother H0517 be childless H7921 (8799) among women H0802. And Samuel H8050 hewed H8158 Agag H0090 in pieces H8158 (8762) before H6440 the LORD H3068 in Gilgal H1537.
015:034 Then Samuel H8050 went H3212 (8799) to Ramah H7414; and Saul H7586 went up H5927 (8804) to his house H1004 to Gibeah H1390 of Saul H7586.
015:035 And Samuel H8050 came no more H3254 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) Saul H7586 until the day H3117 of his death H4194: nevertheless H3588 Samuel H8050 mourned H0056 (8694) for Saul H7586: and the LORD H3068 repented H5162 (8738) that he had made Saul H7586 king H4427 (8689) over Israel H3478.
016:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, How long wilt thou mourn H0056 (8693) for Saul H7586, seeing I have rejected H3988 (8804) him from reigning H4427 (8800) over Israel H3478? fill H4390 (8761) thine horn H7161 with oil H8081, and go H3212 (8798), I will send H7971 (8799) thee to Jesse H3448 the Bethlehemite H1022: for I have provided H7200 (8804) me a king H4428 among his sons H1121.
016:002 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799), How can I go H3212 (8799)? if Saul H7586 hear H8085 (8804) [it], he will kill H2026 (8804) me. And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Take H3947 (8799) an heifer H1241 H5697 with thee H3027, and say H0559 (8804), I am come H0935 (8804) to sacrifice H2076 (8800) to the LORD H3068.
016:003 And call H7121 (8804) Jesse H3448 to the sacrifice H2077, and I will shew H3045 (8686) thee what thou shalt do H6213 (8799): and thou shalt anoint H4886 (8804) unto me [him] whom I name H0559 (8799) unto thee.
016:004 And Samuel H8050 did H6213 (8799) that which the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765), and came H0935 (8799) to Bethlehem H1035. And the elders H2205 of the town H5892 trembled H2729 (8799) at his coming H7125 (8800), and said H0559 (8799), Comest H0935 (8800) thou peaceably H7965?
016:005 And he said H0559 (8799), Peaceably H7965: I am come H0935 (8804) to sacrifice H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068: sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves, and come H0935 (8804) with me to the sacrifice H2077. And he sanctified H6942 (8762) Jesse H3448 and his sons H1121, and called H7121 (8799) them to the sacrifice H2077.
016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come H0935 (8800), that he looked H7200 (8799) on Eliab H0446, and said H0559 (8799), Surely the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899 [is] before him.
016:007 But the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Samuel H8050, Look H5027 (8686) not on his countenance H4758, or on the height H1364 of his stature H6967; because I have refused H3988 (8804) him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man H0120 seeth H7200 (8799); for man H0120 looketh H7200 (8799) on the outward appearance H5869, but the LORD H3068 looketh H7200 (8799) on the heart H3824.
016:008 Then Jesse H3448 called H7121 (8799) Abinadab H0041, and made him pass H5674 (8686) before H6440 Samuel H8050. And he said H0559 (8799), Neither hath the LORD H3068 chosen H0977 (8804) this.
016:009 Then Jesse H3448 made Shammah H8048 to pass by H5674 (8686). And he said H0559 (8799), Neither hath the LORD H3068 chosen H0977 (8804) this.
016:010 Again, Jesse H3448 made seven H7651 of his sons H1121 to pass H5674 (8686) before H6440 Samuel H8050. And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto Jesse H3448, The LORD H3068 hath not chosen H0977 (8804) these.
016:011 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto Jesse H3448, Are here all H8552 (8804) [thy] children H5288? And he said H0559 (8799), There remaineth H7604 (8804) yet the youngest H6996, and, behold, he keepeth H7462 (8802) the sheep H6629. And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) unto Jesse H3448, Send H7971 (8798) and fetch H3947 (8798) him: for we will not sit down H5437 (8799) till he come H0935 (8800) hither H6311.
016:012 And he sent H7971 (8799), and brought him in H0935 (8686). Now he [was] ruddy H0132, [and] withal H5973 of a beautiful H3303 countenance H5869, and goodly H2896 to look to H7210. And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798), anoint H4886 (8798) him: for this [is] he.
016:013 Then Samuel H8050 took H3947 (8799) the horn H7161 of oil H8081, and anointed H4886 (8799) him in the midst H7130 of his brethren H0251: and the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came H6743 (8799) upon David H1732 from that day H3117 forward H4605. So Samuel H8050 rose up H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Ramah H7414.
016:014 But the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 departed H5493 (8804) from Saul H7586, and an evil H7451 spirit H7307 from the LORD H3068 troubled H1204 (8765) him.
016:015 And Saul’s H7586 servants H5650 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold now, an evil H7451 spirit H7307 from God H0430 troubleth H1204 (8764) thee.
016:016 Let our lord H0113 now command H0559 (8799) thy servants H5650, [which are] before H6440 thee, to seek out H1245 (8762) a man H0376, [who is] a cunning H3045 (8802) player H5059 (8764) on an harp H3658: and it shall come to pass, when the evil H7451 spirit H7307 from God H0430 is upon thee, that he shall play H5059 (8765) with his hand H3027, and thou shalt be well H2895 (8804).
016:017 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, Provide H7200 (8798) me now a man H0376 that can play H5059 (8763) well H3190 (8688), and bring H0935 (8689) [him] to me.
016:018 Then answered H6030 (8799) one H0259 of the servants H5288, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I have seen H7200 (8804) a son H1121 of Jesse H3448 the Bethlehemite H1022, [that is] cunning H3045 (8802) in playing H5059 (8763), and a mighty H1368 valiant man H2428, and a man H0376 of war H4421, and prudent H0995 (8737) in matters H1697, and a comely H8389 person H0376, and the LORD H3068 [is] with him.
016:019 Wherefore Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto Jesse H3448, and said H0559 (8799), Send H7971 (8798) me David H1732 thy son H1121, which [is] with the sheep H6629.
016:020 And Jesse H3448 took H3947 (8799) an ass H2543 [laden] with bread H3899, and a bottle H4997 of wine H3196, and a H0259 kid H1423 H5795, and sent H7971 (8799) [them] by H3027 David H1732 his son H1121 unto Saul H7586.
016:021 And David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to Saul H7586, and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 him: and he loved H0157 (8799) him greatly H3966; and he became his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627.
016:022 And Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) to Jesse H3448, saying H0559 (8800), Let David H1732, I pray thee, stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 me; for he hath found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in my sight H5869.
016:023 And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit H7307 from God H0430 was upon Saul H7586, that David H1732 took H3947 (8804) an harp H3658, and played H5059 (8765) with his hand H3027: so Saul H7586 was refreshed H7304 (8804), and was well H2895 (8804), and the evil H7451 spirit H7307 departed H5493 (8804) from him.
017:001 ¶ Now the Philistines H6430 gathered together H0622 (8799) their armies H4264 to battle H4421, and were gathered together H0622 (8735) at Shochoh H7755, which [belongeth] to Judah H3063, and pitched H2583 (8799) between Shochoh H7755 and Azekah H5825, in Ephesdammim H0658.
017:002 And Saul H7586 and the men H0376 of Israel H3478 were gathered together H0622 (8738), and pitched H2583 (8799) by the valley H6010 of Elah H0425, and set the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Philistines H6430.
017:003 And the Philistines H6430 stood H5975 (8802) on a mountain H2022 on the one side, and Israel H3478 stood H5975 (8802) on a mountain H2022 on the other side: and [there was] a valley H1516 between them.
017:004 And there went out H3318 (8799) a champion H0376 H1143 out of the camp H4264 of the Philistines H6430, named H8034 Goliath H1555, of Gath H1661, whose height H1363 [was] six H8337 cubits H0520 and a span H2239.
017:005 And [he had] an helmet H3553 of brass H5178 upon his head H7218, and he [was] armed H3847 (8803) with a coat H8302 of mail H7193; and the weight H4948 of the coat H8302 [was] five H2568 thousand H0505 shekels H8255 of brass H5178.
017:006 And [he had] greaves H4697 of brass H5178 upon his legs H7272, and a target H3591 of brass H5178 between his shoulders H3802.
017:007 And the staff H6086 (8675) H2671 of his spear H2595 [was] like a weaver’s H0707 (8802) beam H4500; and his spear’s H2595 head H3852 [weighed] six H8337 hundred H3967 shekels H8255 of iron H1270: and one bearing H5375 (8802) a shield H6793 went H1980 (8802) before H6440 him.
017:008 And he stood H5975 (8799) and cried H7121 (8799) unto the armies H4634 of Israel H3478, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Why are ye come out H3318 (8799) to set [your] battle H4421 in array H6186 (8800)? [am] not I a Philistine H6430, and ye servants H5650 to Saul H7586? choose H1262 (8798) you a man H0376 for you, and let him come down H3381 (8799) to me.
017:009 If he be able H3201 (8799) to fight H3898 (8736) with me, and to kill H5221 (8689) me, then will we be your servants H5650: but if I prevail H3201 (8799) against him, and kill H5221 (8689) him, then shall ye be our servants H5650, and serve H5647 (8804) us.
017:010 And the Philistine H6430 said H0559 (8799), I defy H2778 (8765) the armies H4634 of Israel H3478 this day H3117; give H5414 (8798) me a man H0376, that we may fight H3898 (8735) together H3162.
017:011 When Saul H7586 and all Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8799) those words H1697 of the Philistine H6430, they were dismayed H2865 (8735), and greatly H3966 afraid H3372 (8799).
017:012 Now David H1732 [was] the son H1121 of that Ephrathite H0376 H0673 of Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063, whose name H8034 [was] Jesse H3448; and he had eight H8083 sons H1121: and the man H0376 went H0935 (8804) among men H0582 [for] an old man H2204 (8804) in the days H3117 of Saul H7586.
017:013 And the three H7969 eldest H1419 sons H1121 of Jesse H3448 went H3212 (8799) [and] followed H0310 Saul H7586 to the battle H4421: and the names H8034 of his three H7969 sons H1121 that went H1980 (8804) to the battle H4421 [were] Eliab H0446 the firstborn H1060, and next H4932 unto him Abinadab H0041, and the third H7992 Shammah H8048.
017:014 And David H1732 [was] the youngest H6996: and the three H7969 eldest H1419 followed H1980 (8804) H0310 Saul H7586.
017:015 But David H1732 went H1980 (8802) and returned H7725 (8802) from Saul H7586 to feed H7462 (8800) his father’s H0001 sheep H6629 at Bethlehem H1035.
017:016 And the Philistine H6430 drew near H5066 (8799) morning H7925 (8687) and evening H6150 (8687), and presented H3320 (8691) himself forty H0705 days H3117.
017:017 And Jesse H3448 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732 his son H1121, Take H3947 (8798) now for thy brethren H0251 an ephah H0374 of this H2088 parched H7039 [corn], and these ten H6235 loaves H3899, and run H7323 (8685) to the camp H4264 to thy brethren H0251;
017:018 And carry H0935 (8686) these ten H6235 cheeses H2461 H2757 unto the captain H8269 of [their] thousand H0505, and look H6485 (8799) how thy brethren H0251 fare H7965, and take H3947 (8799) their pledge H6161.
017:019 Now Saul H7586, and they, and all the men H0376 of Israel H3478, [were] in the valley H6010 of Elah H0425, fighting H3898 (8737) with the Philistines H6430.
017:020 And David H1732 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and left H5203 (8799) the sheep H6629 with a keeper H8104 (8802), and took H5375 (8799), and went H3212 (8799), as Jesse H3448 had commanded H6680 (8765) him; and he came H0935 (8799) to the trench H4570, as the host H2428 was going forth H3318 (8802) to the fight H4634, and shouted H7321 (8689) for the battle H4421.
017:021 For Israel H3478 and the Philistines H6430 had put the battle in array H6186 (8799), army H4634 against H7125 (8800) army H4634.
017:022 And David H1732 left H5203 (8799) his carriage H3627 in the hand H3027 of the keeper H8104 (8802) of the carriage H3627, and ran H7323 (8799) into the army H4634, and came H0935 (8799) and saluted H7592 (8799) H7965 his brethren H0251.
017:023 And as he talked H1696 (8764) with them, behold, there came up H5927 (8802) the champion H0376 H1143, the Philistine H6430 of Gath H1661, Goliath H1555 by name H8034, out of the armies H4634 (8675) H4630 of the Philistines H6430, and spake H1696 (8762) according to the same H0428 words H1697: and David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) [them].
017:024 And all the men H0376 of Israel H3478, when they saw H7200 (8800) the man H0376, fled H5127 (8799) from him H6440, and were sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8799).
017:025 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Have ye seen H7200 (8804) this man H0376 that is come up H5927 (8802)? surely to defy H2778 (8763) Israel H3478 is he come up H5927 (8802): and it shall be, [that] the man H0376 who killeth H5221 (8686) him, the king H4428 will enrich H6238 (8686) him with great H1419 riches H6239, and will give H5414 (8799) him his daughter H1323, and make H6213 (8799) his father’s H0001 house H1004 free H2670 in Israel H3478.
017:026 And David H1732 spake H0559 (8799) to the men H0582 that stood H5975 (8802) by him, saying H0559 (8800), What shall be done H6213 (8735) to the man H0376 that killeth H5221 (8686) this H1975 Philistine H6430, and taketh away H5493 (8689) the reproach H2781 from Israel H3478? for who [is] this uncircumcised H6189 Philistine H6430, that he should defy H2778 (8765) the armies H4634 of the living H2416 God H0430?
017:027 And the people H5971 answered H0559 (8799) him after this manner H1697, saying H0559 (8800), So shall it be done H6213 (8735) to the man H0376 that killeth H5221 (8686) him.
017:028 And Eliab H0446 his eldest H1419 brother H0251 heard H8085 (8799) when he spake H1696 (8763) unto the men H0582; and Eliab’s H0446 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) against David H1732, and he said H0559 (8799), Why camest thou down H3381 (8804) hither? and with whom hast thou left H5203 (8804) those H2007 few H4592 sheep H6629 in the wilderness H4057? I know H3045 (8804) thy pride H2087, and the naughtiness H7455 of thine heart H3824; for thou art come down H3381 (8804) that thou mightest see H7200 (8800) the battle H4421.
017:029 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), What have I now done H6213 (8804)? [Is there] not a cause H1697?
017:030 And he turned H5437 (8735) from him H0681 toward H4136 another H0312, and spake H0559 (8799) after the same manner H1697: and the people H5971 answered H1697 him again H7725 (8686) after the former H7223 manner H1697.
017:031 And when the words H1697 were heard H8085 (8735) which David H1732 spake H1696 (8765), they rehearsed H5046 (8686) [them] before H6440 Saul H7586: and he sent H3947 (8799) for him.
017:032 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, Let no man’s H0120 heart H3820 fail H5307 (8799) because of him; thy servant H5650 will go H3212 (8799) and fight H3898 (8738) with this Philistine H6430.
017:033 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Thou art not able H3201 (8799) to go H3212 (8800) against this Philistine H6430 to fight H3898 (8736) with him: for thou [art but] a youth H5288, and he a man H0376 of war H4421 from his youth H5271.
017:034 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, Thy servant H5650 kept H7462 (8802) his father’s H0001 sheep H6629, and there came H0935 (8804) a lion H0738, and a bear H1677, and took H5375 (8804) a lamb H7716 (8675) H2089 out of the flock H5739:
017:035 And I went out H3318 (8804) after H0310 him, and smote H5221 (8689) him, and delivered H5337 (8689) [it] out of his mouth H6310: and when he arose H6965 (8799) against me, I caught H2388 (8689) [him] by his beard H2206, and smote H5221 (8689) him, and slew H4191 (8689) him.
017:036 Thy servant H5650 slew H5221 (8689) both the lion H0738 and the bear H1677: and this uncircumcised H6189 Philistine H6430 shall be as one H0259 of them, seeing he hath defied H2778 (8765) the armies H4634 of the living H2416 God H0430.
017:037 David H1732 said H0559 (8799) moreover, The LORD H3068 that delivered H5337 (8689) me out of the paw H3027 of the lion H0738, and out of the paw H3027 of the bear H1677, he will deliver H5337 (8686) me out of the hand H3027 of this Philistine H6430. And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Go H3212 (8798), and the LORD H3068 be with thee.
017:038 And Saul H7586 armed H3847 (8686) David H1732 with his armour H4055, and he put H5414 (8804) an helmet H6959 of brass H5178 upon his head H7218; also he armed H3847 (8686) him with a coat of mail H8302.
017:039 And David H1732 girded H2296 (8799) his sword H2719 upon his armour H4055, and he assayed H2974 (8686) to go H3212 (8800); for he had not proved H5254 (8765) [it]. And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, I cannot H3201 (8799) go H3212 (8800) with these; for I have not proved H5254 (8765) [them]. And David H1732 put H5493 (8686) them off him.
017:040 And he took H3947 (8799) his staff H4731 in his hand H3027, and chose H0977 (8799) him five H2568 smooth H2512 stones H0068 out of the brook H5158, and put H7760 (8799) them in a shepherd’s H7462 (8802) bag H3627 which he had, even in a scrip H3219; and his sling H7050 [was] in his hand H3027: and he drew near H5066 (8799) to the Philistine H6430.
017:041 And the Philistine H6430 came H3212 (8799) on H1980 (8802) and drew near H7131 unto David H1732; and the man H0376 that bare H5375 (8802) the shield H6793 [went] before H6440 him.
017:042 And when the Philistine H6430 looked about H5027 (8686), and saw H7200 (8799) David H1732, he disdained H0959 (8799) him: for he was [but] a youth H5288, and ruddy H0132, and of a fair H3303 countenance H4758.
017:043 And the Philistine H6430 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, [Am] I a dog H3611, that thou comest H0935 (8802) to me with staves H4731? And the Philistine H6430 cursed H7043 (8762) David H1732 by his gods H0430.
017:044 And the Philistine H6430 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Come H3212 (8798) to me, and I will give H5414 (8799) thy flesh H1320 unto the fowls H5775 of the air H8064, and to the beasts H0929 of the field H7704.
017:045 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732 to the Philistine H6430, Thou comest H0935 (8802) to me with a sword H2719, and with a spear H2595, and with a shield H3591: but I come H0935 (8802) to thee in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of the armies H4634 of Israel H3478, whom thou hast defied H2778 (8765).
017:046 This day H3117 will the LORD H3068 deliver H5462 (8762) thee into mine hand H3027; and I will smite H5221 (8689) thee, and take H5493 (8689) thine head H7218 from thee; and I will give H5414 (8804) the carcases H6297 of the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430 this day H3117 unto the fowls H5775 of the air H8064, and to the wild beasts H2416 of the earth H0776; that all the earth H0776 may know H3045 (8799) that there is H3426 a God H0430 in Israel H3478.
017:047 And all this assembly H6951 shall know H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 saveth H3467 (8686) not with sword H2719 and spear H2595: for the battle H4421 [is] the LORD’S H3068, and he will give H5414 (8804) you into our hands H3027.
017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine H6430 arose H6965 (8804), and came H3212 (8799) and drew nigh H7126 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) David H1732, that David H1732 hasted H4116 (8762), and ran H7323 (8799) toward the army H4634 to meet H7125 (8800) the Philistine H6430.
017:049 And David H1732 put H7971 (8799) his hand H3027 in his bag H3627, and took H3947 (8799) thence a stone H0068, and slang H7049 (8762) [it], and smote H5221 (8686) the Philistine H6430 in his forehead H4696, that the stone H0068 sunk H2883 (8799) into his forehead H4696; and he fell H5307 (8799) upon his face H6440 to the earth H0776.
017:050 So David H1732 prevailed H2388 (8799) over H4480 the Philistine H6430 with a sling H7050 and with a stone H0068, and smote H5221 (8686) the Philistine H6430, and slew H4191 (8686) him; but [there was] no sword H2719 in the hand H3027 of David H1732.
017:051 Therefore David H1732 ran H7323 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) upon the Philistine H6430, and took H3947 (8799) his sword H2719, and drew H8025 (8799) it out of the sheath H8593 thereof, and slew H4191 (8787) him, and cut off H3772 (8799) his head H7218 therewith. And when the Philistines H6430 saw H7200 (8799) their champion H1368 was dead H4191 (8804), they fled H5127 (8799).
017:052 And the men H0582 of Israel H3478 and of Judah H3063 arose H6965 (8799), and shouted H7321 (8686), and pursued H7291 (8799) the Philistines H6430, until thou come H0935 (8800) to the valley H1516, and to the gates H8179 of Ekron H6138. And the wounded H2491 of the Philistines H6430 fell down H5307 (8799) by the way H1870 to Shaaraim H8189, even unto Gath H1661, and unto Ekron H6138.
017:053 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 returned H7725 (8799) from chasing H1814 (8800) after H0310 the Philistines H6430, and they spoiled H8155 (8799) their tents H4264.
017:054 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) the head H7218 of the Philistine H6430, and brought H0935 (8686) it to Jerusalem H3389; but he put H7760 (8804) his armour H3627 in his tent H0168.
017:055 And when Saul H7586 saw H7200 (8800) David H1732 go forth H3318 (8802) against H7125 (8800) the Philistine H6430, he said H0559 (8804) unto Abner H0074, the captain H8269 of the host H6635, Abner H0074, whose son H1121 [is] this youth H5288? And Abner H0074 said H0559 (8799), [As] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, O king H4428, I cannot H0518 tell H3045 (8804).
017:056 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Enquire H7592 (8798) thou whose son H1121 the stripling H5958 [is].
017:057 And as David H1732 returned H7725 (8800) from the slaughter H5221 (8687) of the Philistine H6430, Abner H0074 took H3947 (8799) him, and brought H0935 (8686) him before H6440 Saul H7586 with the head H7218 of the Philistine H6430 in his hand H3027.
017:058 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to him, Whose son H1121 [art] thou, [thou] young man H5288? And David H1732 answered H0559 (8799), I [am] the son H1121 of thy servant H5650 Jesse H3448 the Bethlehemite H1022.
018:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when he had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) unto Saul H7586, that the soul H5315 of Jonathan H3083 was knit H7194 (8738) with the soul H5315 of David H1732, and Jonathan H3083 loved H0157 (8799) him as his own soul H5315.
018:002 And Saul H7586 took H3947 (8799) him that day H3117, and would let H5414 (8804) him go no more home H7725 (8800) to his father’s H0001 house H1004.
018:003 Then Jonathan H3083 and David H1732 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285, because he loved H0160 him as his own soul H5315.
018:004 And Jonathan H3083 stripped H6584 (8691) himself of the robe H4598 that [was] upon him, and gave H5414 (8799) it to David H1732, and his garments H4055, even to his sword H2719, and to his bow H7198, and to his girdle H2289.
018:005 And David H1732 went out H3318 (8799) whithersoever Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) him, [and] behaved himself wisely H7919 (8686): and Saul H7586 set H7760 (8799) him over the men H0582 of war H4421, and he was accepted H3190 (8799) in the sight H5869 of all the people H5971, and also in the sight H5869 of Saul’s H7586 servants H5650.
018:006 And it came to pass as they came H0935 (8800), when David H1732 was returned H7725 (8800) from the slaughter H5221 (8687) of the Philistine H6430, that the women H0802 came out H3318 (8799) of all cities H5892 of Israel H3478, singing H7891 (8800) and dancing H4246, to meet H7125 (8800) king H4428 Saul H7586, with tabrets H8596, with joy H8057, and with instruments of musick H7991.
018:007 And the women H0802 answered H6030 (8799) [one another] as they played H7832 (8764), and said H0559 (8799), Saul H7586 hath slain H5221 (8689) his thousands H0505, and David H1732 his ten thousands H7233.
018:008 And Saul H7586 was very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799), and the saying H1697 displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 him; and he said H0559 (8799), They have ascribed H5414 (8804) unto David H1732 ten thousands H7233, and to me they have ascribed H5414 (8804) [but] thousands H0505: and [what] can he have more but the kingdom H4410?
018:009 And Saul H7586 eyed H5770 (8802) David H1732 from that day H3117 and forward H1973.
018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that the evil H7451 spirit H7307 from God H0430 came H6743 (8799) upon Saul H7586, and he prophesied H5012 (8691) in the midst H8432 of the house H1004: and David H1732 played H5059 (8764) with his hand H3027, as at other times H3117: and [there was] a javelin H2595 in Saul’s H7586 hand H3027.
018:011 And Saul H7586 cast H2904 (8686) the javelin H2595; for he said H0559 (8799), I will smite H5221 (8686) David H1732 even to the wall H7023 [with it]. And David H1732 avoided out H5437 (8735) of his presence H6440 twice H6471.
018:012 And Saul H7586 was afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 David H1732, because the LORD H3068 was with him, and was departed H5493 (8804) from Saul H7586.
018:013 Therefore Saul H7586 removed H5493 (8686) him from him, and made H7760 (8799) him his captain H8269 over a thousand H0505; and he went out H3318 (8799) and came in H0935 (8799) before H6440 the people H5971.
018:014 And David H1732 behaved himself wisely H7919 (8688) in all his ways H1870; and the LORD H3068 [was] with him.
018:015 Wherefore when Saul H7586 saw H7200 (8799) that he behaved H7919 himself very H3966 wisely H7919 (8688), he was afraid H1481 (8799) of H6440 him.
018:016 But all Israel H3478 and Judah H3063 loved H0157 (8802) David H1732, because he went out H3318 (8802) and came in H0935 (8802) before H6440 them.
018:017 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Behold my elder H1419 daughter H1323 Merab H4764, her will I give H5414 (8799) thee to wife H0802: only be thou valiant H1121 H2428 for me, and fight H3898 (8734) the LORD’S H3068 battles H4421. For Saul H7586 said H0559 (8804), Let not mine hand H3027 be upon him, but let the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430 be upon him.
018:018 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, Who [am] I? and what [is] my life H2416, [or] my father’s H0001 family H4940 in Israel H3478, that I should be son in law H2860 to the king H4428?
018:019 But it came to pass at the time H6256 when Merab H4764 Saul’s H7586 daughter H1323 should have been given H5414 (8800) to David H1732, that she was given H5414 (8738) unto Adriel H5741 the Meholathite H4259 to wife H0802.
018:020 And Michal H4324 Saul’s H7586 daughter H1323 loved H0157 (8799) David H1732: and they told H5046 (8686) Saul H7586, and the thing H1697 pleased H3474 (8799) H5869 him.
018:021 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), I will give H5414 (8799) him her, that she may be a snare H4170 to him, and that the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430 may be against him. Wherefore Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Thou shalt this day H3117 be my son in law H2859 (8691) in [the one of] the twain H8147.
018:022 And Saul H7586 commanded H6680 (8762) his servants H5650, [saying], Commune H1696 (8761) with David H1732 secretly H3909, and say H0559 (8800), Behold, the king H4428 hath delight H2654 (8804) in thee, and all his servants H5650 love H0157 (8804) thee: now therefore be the king’s H4428 son in law H2859 (8690).
018:023 And Saul’s H7586 servants H5650 spake H1696 (8762) those words H1697 in the ears H0241 of David H1732. And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Seemeth H5869 it to you [a] light H7043 (8738) [thing] to be a king’s H4428 son in law H2859 (8692), seeing that I [am] a poor H7326 (8802) man H0376, and lightly esteemed H7034 (8737)?
018:024 And the servants H5650 of Saul H7586 told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), On this manner H1697 spake H1696 (8765) David H1732.
018:025 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) to David H1732, The king H4428 desireth H2656 not any dowry H4119, but an hundred H3967 foreskins H6190 of the Philistines H6430, to be avenged H5358 (8736) of the king’s H4428 enemies H0341 (8802). But Saul H7586 thought H2803 (8804) to make David H1732 fall H5307 (8687) by the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
018:026 And when his servants H5650 told H5046 (8686) David H1732 these words H1697, it pleased H3474 (8799) H1697 H5869 David H1732 well to be the king’s H4428 son in law H2859 (8692): and the days H3117 were not expired H4390 (8804).
018:027 Wherefore David H1732 arose H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799), he and his men H0582, and slew H5221 (8686) of the Philistines H6430 two hundred H3967 men H0376; and David H1732 brought H0935 (8686) their foreskins H6190, and they gave them in full tale H4390 (8762) to the king H4428, that he might be the king’s H4428 son in law H2859 (8692). And Saul H7586 gave H5414 (8799) him Michal H4324 his daughter H1323 to wife H0802.
018:028 And Saul H7586 saw H7200 (8799) and knew H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 [was] with David H1732, and [that] Michal H4324 Saul’s H7586 daughter H1323 loved H0157 (8804) him.
018:029 And Saul H7586 was yet the more H3254 (8686) afraid H3372 (8800) of H6440 David H1732; and Saul H7586 became David’s H1732 enemy H0341 (8802) continually H3117.
018:030 Then the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430 went forth H3318 (8799): and it came to pass, after H1767 they went forth H3318 (8800), [that] David H1732 behaved himself more wisely H7919 (8804) than all the servants H5650 of Saul H7586; so that his name H8034 was much H3966 set by H3365 (8799).
019:001 ¶ And Saul H7586 spake H1696 (8762) to Jonathan H3129 his son H1121, and to all his servants H5650, that they should kill H4191 (8687) David H1732.
019:002 But Jonathan H3083 Saul’s H7586 son H1121 delighted H2654 (8804) much H3966 in David H1732: and Jonathan H3083 told H5046 (8686) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Saul H7586 my father H0001 seeketh H1245 (8764) to kill H4191 (8687) thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed H8104 (8734) to thyself until the morning H1242, and abide H3427 (8804) in a secret H5643 [place], and hide H2244 (8738) thyself:
019:003 And I will go out H3318 (8799) and stand H5975 (8804) beside H3027 my father H0001 in the field H7704 where thou [art], and I will commune H1696 (8762) with my father H0001 of thee; and what H4100 I see H7200 (8804), that I will tell H5046 (8689) thee.
019:004 And Jonathan H3083 spake H1696 (8762) good H2896 of David H1732 unto Saul H7586 his father H0001, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Let not the king H4428 sin H2398 (8799) against his servant H5650, against David H1732; because he hath not sinned H2398 (8804) against thee, and because his works H4639 [have been] to thee-ward very H3966 good H2896:
019:005 For he did put H7760 (8799) his life H5315 in his hand H3709, and slew H5221 (8686) the Philistine H6430, and the LORD H3068 wrought H6213 (8799) a great H1419 salvation H8668 for all Israel H3478: thou sawest H7200 (8804) [it], and didst rejoice H8055 (8799): wherefore then wilt thou sin H2398 (8799) against innocent H5355 blood H1818, to slay H4191 (8687) David H1732 without a cause H2600?
019:006 And Saul H7586 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of Jonathan H3083: and Saul H7586 sware H7650 (8735), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, he shall not H0518 be slain H4191 (8714).
019:007 And Jonathan H3083 called H7121 (8799) David H1732, and Jonathan H3083 shewed H5046 (8686) him all those things H1697. And Jonathan H3083 brought H0935 (8686) David H1732 to Saul H7586, and he was in his presence H6440, as in times past H0865 H8032.
019:008 And there was war H4421 again H3254 (8686): and David H1732 went out H3318 (8799), and fought H3898 (8735) with the Philistines H6430, and slew H5221 (8686) them with a great H1419 slaughter H4347; and they fled H5127 (8799) from H6440 him.
019:009 And the evil H7451 spirit H7307 from the LORD H3068 was upon Saul H7586, as he sat H3427 (8802) in his house H1004 with his javelin H2595 in his hand H3027: and David H1732 played H5059 (8764) with [his] hand H3027.
019:010 And Saul H7586 sought H1245 (8762) to smite H5221 (8687) David H1732 even to the wall H7023 with the javelin H2595; but he slipped away H6362 (8799) out of Saul’s H7586 presence H6440, and he smote H5221 (8686) the javelin H2595 into the wall H7023: and David H1732 fled H5127 (8804), and escaped H4422 (8735) that night H3915.
019:011 Saul H7586 also sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto David’s H1732 house H1004, to watch H8104 (8800) him, and to slay H4191 (8687) him in the morning H1242: and Michal H4324 David’s H1732 wife H0802 told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), If thou save H4422 (8764) not thy life H5315 to night H3915, to morrow H4279 thou shalt be slain H4191 (8716).
019:012 So Michal H4324 let H3381 David H1732 down H3381 (8686) through a window H2474: and he went H3212 (8799), and fled H1272 (8799), and escaped H4422 (8735).
019:013 And Michal H4324 took H3947 (8799) an image H8655, and laid H7760 (8799) [it] in the bed H4296, and put H7760 (8804) a pillow H3523 of goats H5795 ’ [hair] for his bolster H4763, and covered H3680 (8762) [it] with a cloth H0899.
019:014 And when Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to take H3947 (8800) David H1732, she said H0559 (8799), He [is] sick H2470 (8802).
019:015 And Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) the messengers H4397 [again] to see H7200 (8800) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Bring him up H5927 (8685) to me in the bed H4296, that I may slay H4191 (8687) him.
019:016 And when the messengers H4397 were come in H0935 (8799), behold, [there was] an image H8655 in the bed H4296, with a pillow H3523 of goats H5795 ’ [hair] for his bolster H4763.
019:017 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto Michal H4324, Why hast thou deceived me so H7411 (8765), and sent away H7971 (8762) mine enemy H0341 (8802), that he is escaped H4422 (8735)? And Michal H4324 answered H0559 (8799) Saul H7586, He said H0559 (8804) unto me, Let me go H7971 (8761); why should I kill H4191 (8686) thee?
019:018 So David H1732 fled H1272 (8804), and escaped H4422 (8735), and came H0935 (8799) to Samuel H8050 to Ramah H7414, and told H5046 (8686) him all that Saul H7586 had done H6213 (8804) to him. And he and Samuel H8050 went H3212 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in Naioth H5121.
019:019 And it was told H5046 (8714) Saul H7586, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, David H1732 [is] at Naioth H5121 in Ramah H7414.
019:020 And Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to take H3947 (8800) David H1732: and when they saw H7200 (8799) the company H3862 of the prophets H5030 prophesying H5012 (8737), and Samuel H8050 standing H5975 (8802) [as] appointed H5324 (8737) over them, the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 was upon the messengers H4397 of Saul H7586, and they also prophesied H5012 (8691).
019:021 And when it was told H5046 (8686) Saul H7586, he sent H7971 (8799) other H0312 messengers H4397, and they prophesied H5012 (8691) likewise. And Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 again H3254 (8686) the third H7992 time, and they prophesied H5012 (8691) also.
019:022 Then went H3212 (8799) he also to Ramah H7414, and came H0935 (8799) to a great H1419 well H0953 that [is] in Sechu H7906: and he asked H7592 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Where H0375 [are] Samuel H8050 and David H1732? And [one] said H0559 (8799), Behold, [they be] at Naioth H5121 in Ramah H7414.
019:023 And he went H3212 (8799) thither to Naioth H5121 in Ramah H7414: and the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 was upon him also, and he went H3212 (8799) on H1980 (8800), and prophesied H5012 (8691), until he came H0935 (8800) to Naioth H5121 in Ramah H7414.
019:024 And he stripped off H6584 (8799) his clothes H0899 also H1571, and prophesied H5012 (8691) before H6440 Samuel H8050 in like manner, and lay down H5307 (8799) naked H6174 all that day H3117 and all that night H3915. Wherefore they say H0559 (8799), [Is] Saul H7586 also among the prophets H5030?
020:001 ¶ And David H1732 fled H1272 (8799) from Naioth H5121 in Ramah H7414, and came H0935 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) before H6440 Jonathan H3083, What have I done H6213 (8804)? what [is] mine iniquity H5771? and what [is] my sin H2403 before H6440 thy father H0001, that he seeketh H1245 (8764) my life H5315?
020:002 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, God forbid H2486; thou shalt not die H4191 (8799): behold, my father H0001 will do H6213 (8799) (8675) H6213 (8804) nothing H1697 either great H1419 or small H6996, but that he will shew H1540 (8799) H0241 it me: and why should my father H0001 hide H5641 (8686) this thing H1697 from me? it [is] not [so].
020:003 And David H1732 sware H7650 (8735) moreover, and said H0559 (8799), Thy father H0001 certainly H3045 (8800) knoweth H3045 (8804) that I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thine eyes H5869; and he saith H0559 (8799), Let not Jonathan H3083 know H3045 (8799) this, lest he be grieved H6087 (8735): but truly H0199 [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, [there is] but a step H6587 between me and death H4194.
020:004 Then said H0559 (8799) Jonathan H3083 unto David H1732, Whatsoever thy soul H5315 desireth H0559 (8799), I will even do H6213 (8799) [it] for thee.
020:005 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Jonathan H3083, Behold, to morrow H4279 [is] the new moon H2320, and I should not fail H3427 (8800) to sit H3427 (8799) with the king H4428 at meat H0398 (8800): but let me go H7971 (8765), that I may hide H5641 (8738) myself in the field H7704 unto the third H7992 [day] at even H6153.
020:006 If thy father H0001 at all H6485 (8800) miss H6485 (8799) me, then say H0559 (8804), David H1732 earnestly H7592 (8736) asked H7592 (8738) [leave] of me that he might run H7323 (8800) to Bethlehem H1035 his city H5892: for [there is] a yearly H3117 sacrifice H2077 there for all the family H4940.
020:007 If he say H0559 (8799) thus, [It is] well H2896; thy servant H5650 shall have peace H7965: but if he be very H2734 (8800) wroth H2734 (8799), [then] be sure H3045 (8798) that evil H7451 is determined H3615 (8804) by him.
020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal H6213 (8804) kindly H2617 with thy servant H5650; for thou hast brought H0935 (8689) thy servant H5650 into a covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 with thee: notwithstanding, if there be H3426 in me iniquity H5771, slay H4191 (8685) me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring H0935 (8686) me to thy father H0001?
020:009 And Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799), Far be it from thee H2486: for if I knew H3045 (8799) certainly H3045 (8800) that evil H7451 were determined H3615 (8804) by my father H0001 to come H0935 (8800) upon thee, then would not I tell H5046 (8686) it thee?
020:010 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732 to Jonathan H3083, Who shall tell H5046 (8686) me? or what [if] thy father H0001 answer H6030 (8799) thee roughly H7186?
020:011 And Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Come H3212 (8798), and let us go out H3318 (8799) into the field H7704. And they went out H3318 (8799) both H8147 of them into the field H7704.
020:012 And Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, when I have sounded H2713 (8799) my father H0001 about to morrow H4279 any time H6256, [or] the third H7992 [day], and, behold, [if there be] good H2895 (8804) toward David H1732, and I then send H7971 (8799) not unto thee, and shew H1540 (8804) H0241 it thee;
020:013 The LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) so H3541 and much more H3254 (8686) to Jonathan H3083: but if it please H3190 (8686) my father H0001 [to do] thee evil H7451, then I will shew H1540 (8804) H0241 it thee, and send thee away H7971 (8765), that thou mayest go H1980 (8804) in peace H7965: and the LORD H3068 be with thee, as he hath been with my father H0001.
020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet H0518 I live H2416 shew H6213 (8799) me the kindness H2617 of the LORD H3068, that I die H4191 (8799) not:
020:015 But [also] thou shalt not cut off H3772 (8686) thy kindness H2617 from my house H1004 for H5704 ever H5769: no, not when the LORD H3068 hath cut off H3772 (8687) the enemies H0341 (8802) of David H1732 every one H0376 from the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
020:016 So Jonathan H3083 made H3772 (8799) [a covenant] with the house H1004 of David H1732, [saying], Let the LORD H3068 even require H1245 (8765) [it] at the hand H3027 of David’s H1732 enemies H0341 (8802).
020:017 And Jonathan H3083 caused David H1732 to swear H7650 (8687) again H3254 (8686), because he loved H0160 him: for he loved H0157 (8804) him as he loved H0160 his own soul H5315.
020:018 Then Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, To morrow H4279 [is] the new moon H2320: and thou shalt be missed H6485 (8738), because thy seat H4186 will be empty H6485 (8735).
020:019 And [when] thou hast stayed three days H8027 (8765), [then] thou shalt go down H3381 (8799) quickly H3966, and come H0935 (8804) to the place H4725 where thou didst hide H5641 (8738) thyself when H3117 the business H4639 was [in hand], and shalt remain H3427 (8804) by H0681 the stone H0068 Ezel H0237.
020:020 And I will shoot H3384 (8686) three H7969 arrows H2671 on the side H6654 [thereof], as though I shot H7971 (8763) at a mark H4307.
020:021 And, behold, I will send H7971 (8799) a lad H5288, [saying], Go H3212 (8798), find out H4672 (8798) the arrows H2671. If I expressly H0559 (8800) say H0559 (8799) unto the lad H5288, Behold, the arrows H2671 [are] on this side of thee, take H3947 (8798) them; then come H0935 (8798) thou: for [there is] peace H7965 to thee, and no hurt H1697; [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416.
020:022 But if I say H0559 (8799) thus unto the young man H5958, Behold, the arrows H2671 [are] beyond H1973 thee; go thy way H3212 (8798): for the LORD H3068 hath sent thee away H7971 (8765).
020:023 And [as touching] the matter H1697 which thou and I have spoken H1696 (8765) of, behold, the LORD H3068 [be] between thee and me for H5704 ever H5769.
020:024 So David H1732 hid H5641 (8735) himself in the field H7704: and when the new moon H2320 was come, the king H4428 sat him down H3427 (8799) to eat H0398 (8800) meat H3899.
020:025 And the king H4428 sat H3427 (8799) upon his seat H4186, as at other times H6471, [even] upon a seat H4186 by the wall H7023: and Jonathan H3083 arose H6965 (8799), and Abner H0074 sat H3427 (8799) by Saul’s H7586 side H6654, and David’s H1732 place H4725 was empty H6485 (8735).
020:026 Nevertheless Saul H7586 spake H1696 (8765) not any thing H3972 that day H3117: for he thought H0559 (8804), Something hath befallen H4745 him, he [is] not H1115 clean H2889; surely he [is] not clean H2889.
020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, [which was] the second H8145 [day] of the month H2320, that David’s H1732 place H4725 was empty H6485 (8735): and Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto Jonathan H3083 his son H1121, Wherefore cometh H0935 (8804) not the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 to meat H3899, neither yesterday H8543, nor to day H3117?
020:028 And Jonathan H3083 answered H6030 (8799) Saul H7586, David H1732 earnestly H7592 (8736) asked H7592 (8738) [leave] of me H5978 [to go] to Bethlehem H1035:
020:029 And he said H0559 (8799), Let me go H7971 (8761), I pray thee; for our family H4940 hath a sacrifice H2077 in the city H5892; and my brother H0251, he hath commanded H6680 (8765) me [to be there]: and now, if I have found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in thine eyes H5869, let me get away H4422 (8735), I pray thee, and see H7200 (8799) my brethren H0251. Therefore he cometh H0935 (8804) not unto the king’s H4428 table H7979.
020:030 Then Saul’s H7586 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Jonathan H3083, and he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou son H1121 of the perverse H5753 (8737) rebellious H4780 [woman], do not I know H3045 (8804) that thou hast chosen H0977 (8802) the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 to thine own confusion H1322, and unto the confusion H1322 of thy mother’s H0517 nakedness H6172?
020:031 For as long as H3117 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 liveth H2425 (8804) upon the ground H0127, thou shalt not be established H3559 (8735), nor thy kingdom H4438. Wherefore now send H7971 (8798) and fetch H3947 (8798) him unto me, for he shall surely die H1121 H4194.
020:032 And Jonathan H3083 answered H6030 (8799) Saul H7586 his father H0001, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain H4191 (8714)? what hath he done H6213 (8804)?
020:033 And Saul H7586 cast H2904 (8686) a javelin H2595 at him to smite H5221 (8687) him: whereby Jonathan H3083 knew H3045 (8799) that it was determined H3617 of his father H0001 to slay H4191 (8687) David H1732.
020:034 So Jonathan H3083 arose H6965 (8799) from the table H7979 in fierce H2750 anger H0639, and did eat H0398 (8804) no meat H3899 the second H8145 day H3117 of the month H2320: for he was grieved H6087 (8738) for David H1732, because his father H0001 had done him shame H3637 (8689).
020:035 And it came to pass in the morning H1242, that Jonathan H3083 went out H3318 (8799) into the field H7704 at the time appointed H4150 with David H1732, and a little H6996 lad H5288 with him.
020:036 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his lad H5288, Run H7323 (8798), find out H4672 (8798) now the arrows H2671 which I shoot H3384 (8688). [And] as the lad H5288 ran H7323 (8801), he shot H3384 (8804) an arrow H2678 beyond H5674 (8687) him.
020:037 And when the lad H5288 was come H0935 (8799) to the place H4725 of the arrow H2678 which Jonathan H3083 had shot H3384 (8804), Jonathan H3083 cried H7121 (8799) after H0310 the lad H5288, and said H0559 (8799), [Is] not the arrow H2678 beyond H1973 thee?
020:038 And Jonathan H3083 cried H7121 (8799) after H0310 the lad H5288, Make speed H4120, haste H2363 (8798), stay H5975 (8799) not. And Jonathan’s H3083 lad H5288 gathered up H3950 (8762) the arrows H2671 (8675) H2678, and came H0935 (8799) to his master H0113.
020:039 But the lad H5288 knew H3045 (8804) not any thing H3972: only Jonathan H3083 and David H1732 knew H3045 (8804) the matter H1697.
020:040 And Jonathan H3083 gave H5414 (8799) his artillery H3627 unto his lad H5288, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go H3212 (8798), carry H0935 (8685) [them] to the city H5892.
020:041 [And] as soon as the lad H5288 was gone H0935 (8802), David H1732 arose H6965 (8804) out of [a place] toward H0681 the south H5045, and fell H5307 (8799) on his face H0639 to the ground H0776, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself three H7969 times H6471: and they kissed H5401 (8799) one H0376 another H7453, and wept H1058 (8799) one H0376 with another H7453, until David H1732 exceeded H1431 (8689).
020:042 And Jonathan H3083 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965, forasmuch as we have sworn H7650 (8738) both H8147 of us in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 be between me and thee, and between my seed H2233 and thy seed H2233 for H5704 ever H5769. And he arose H6965 (8799) and departed H3212 (8799): and Jonathan H3083 went H0935 (8802) into the city H5892.
021:001 ¶ Then came H0935 (8799) David H1732 to Nob H5011 to Ahimelech H0288 the priest H3548: and Ahimelech H0288 was afraid H2729 (8799) at the meeting H7125 (8800) of David H1732, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why [art] thou alone, and no man H0376 with thee?
021:002 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Ahimelech H0288 the priest H3548, The king H4428 hath commanded H6680 (8765) me a business H1697, and hath said H0559 (8799) unto me, Let no man H0376 know H3045 (8799) any thing H3972 of the business H1697 whereabout I send H7971 (8802) thee, and what I have commanded H6680 (8765) thee: and I have appointed H3045 (8776) [my] servants H5288 to such H6423 and such H0492 a place H4725.
021:003 Now therefore what is H3426 under thine hand H3027? give H5414 (8798) [me] five H2568 [loaves of] bread H3899 in mine hand H3027, or what there is present H4672 (8737).
021:004 And the priest H3548 answered H6030 (8799) David H1732, and said H0559 (8799), [There is] no common H2455 bread H3899 under mine hand H3027, but there is H3426 hallowed H6944 bread H3899; if the young men H5288 have kept H8104 (8738) themselves at least H0389 from women H0802.
021:005 And David H1732 answered H6030 (8799) the priest H3548, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Of a truth H0518 women H0802 [have been] kept H6113 (8803) from us about these three H8032 days H8543, since I came out H3318 (8800), and the vessels H3627 of the young men H5288 are holy H6944, and [the bread is] in a manner H1870 common H2455, yea, though it were sanctified H6942 (8799) this day H3117 in the vessel H3627.
021:006 So the priest H3548 gave H5414 (8799) him hallowed H6944 [bread]: for there was no bread H3899 there but the shewbread H3899 H6440, that was taken H5493 (8716) from before H6440 the LORD H3068, to put H7760 (8800) hot H2527 bread H3899 in the day H3117 when it was taken away H3947 (8736).
021:007 Now a certain man H0376 of the servants H5650 of Saul H7586 [was] there that day H3117, detained H6113 (8737) before H6440 the LORD H3068; and his name H8034 [was] Doeg H1673, an Edomite H0130, the chiefest H0047 of the herdmen H7462 (8802) that [belonged] to Saul H7586.
021:008 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Ahimelech H0288, And is there H3426 not H0371 here under thine hand H3027 spear H2595 or sword H2719? for I have neither brought H3947 (8804) my sword H2719 nor my weapons H3627 with me H3027, because the king’s H4428 business H1697 required H1961 (8804) haste H5169 (8803).
021:009 And the priest H3548 said H0559 (8799), The sword H2719 of Goliath H1555 the Philistine H6430, whom thou slewest H5221 (8689) in the valley H6010 of Elah H0425, behold, it [is here] wrapped H3874 (8803) in a cloth H8071 behind H0310 the ephod H0646: if thou wilt take H3947 (8799) that, take H3947 (8798) [it]: for [there is] no other H0312 save H2108 that here H2088. And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), [There is] none like that; give H5414 (8798) it me.
021:010 And David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and fled H1272 (8799) that day H3117 for fear H6440 of Saul H7586, and went H0935 (8799) to Achish H0397 the king H4428 of Gath H1661.
021:011 And the servants H5650 of Achish H0397 said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Is] not this David H1732 the king H4428 of the land H0776? did they not sing H6030 (8799) one to another of him H2088 in dances H4246, saying H0559 (8800), Saul H7586 hath slain H5221 (8689) his thousands H0505, and David H1732 his ten thousands H7233?
021:012 And David H1732 laid up H7760 (8799) these words H1697 in his heart H3824, and was sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 Achish H0397 the king H4428 of Gath H1661.
021:013 And he changed H8138 (8762) his behaviour H2940 before H5869 them, and feigned himself mad H1984 (8704) in their hands H3027, and scrabbled H8427 (8762) on the doors H1817 of the gate H8179, and let his spittle H7388 fall down H3381 (8686) upon his beard H2206.
021:014 Then said H0559 (8799) Achish H0397 unto his servants H5650, Lo, ye see H7200 (8799) the man H0376 is mad H7696 (8693): wherefore [then] have ye brought H0935 (8686) him to me?
021:015 Have I need H2638 of mad men H7696 (8794), that ye have brought H0935 (8689) this [fellow] to play the mad man H7696 (8692) in my presence? shall this [fellow] come H0935 (8799) into my house H1004?
022:001 ¶ David H1732 therefore departed H3212 (8799) thence, and escaped H4422 (8735) to the cave H4631 Adullam H5725: and when his brethren H0251 and all his father’s H0001 house H1004 heard H8085 (8799) [it], they went down H3381 (8799) thither to him.
022:002 And every one H0376 [that was] in distress H4689, and every one H0376 that [was] in debt H5378 (8801), and every one H0376 [that was] discontented H4751 H5315, gathered H6908 (8691) themselves unto him; and he became a captain H8269 over them: and there were with him about four H0702 hundred H3967 men H0376.
022:003 And David H1732 went H3212 (8799) thence to Mizpeh H4708 of Moab H4124: and he said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Moab H4124, Let my father H0001 and my mother H0517, I pray thee, come forth H3318 (8799), [and be] with you, till I know H3045 (8799) what God H0430 will do H6213 (8799) for me.
022:004 And he brought H5148 (8686) them before H6440 the king H4428 of Moab H4124: and they dwelt H3427 (8799) with him all the while H3117 that David H1732 was in the hold H4686.
022:005 And the prophet H5030 Gad H1410 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Abide H3427 (8799) not in the hold H4686; depart H3212 (8798), and get H0935 (8804) thee into the land H0776 of Judah H3063. Then David H1732 departed H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) into the forest H3293 of Hareth H2802.
022:006 When Saul H7586 heard H8085 (8799) that David H1732 was discovered H3045 (8738), and the men H0582 that [were] with him, (now Saul H7586 abode H3427 (8802) in Gibeah H1390 under a tree H0815 in Ramah H7414, having his spear H2595 in his hand H3027, and all his servants H5650 [were] standing H5324 (8737) about him;)
022:007 Then Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650 that stood H5324 (8737) about him, Hear now H8085 (8798), ye Benjamites H1145; will the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 give H5414 (8799) every one of you fields H7704 and vineyards H3754, [and] make H7760 (8799) you all captains H8269 of thousands H0505, and captains H8269 of hundreds H3967;
022:008 That all of you have conspired H7194 (8804) against me, and [there is] none that sheweth H1540 (8802) H0241 me that my son H1121 hath made a league H3772 (8800) with the son H1121 of Jesse H3448, and [there is] none of you that is sorry H2470 (8802) for me, or sheweth H1540 (8802) H0241 unto me that my son H1121 hath stirred up H6965 (8689) my servant H5650 against me, to lie in wait H0693 (8802), as at this day H3117?
022:009 Then answered H6030 (8799) Doeg H1673 the Edomite H0130, which was set H5324 (8737) over the servants H5650 of Saul H7586, and said H0559 (8799), I saw H7200 (8804) the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 coming H0935 (8802) to Nob H5011, to Ahimelech H0288 the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285.
022:010 And he enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068 for him, and gave H5414 (8804) him victuals H6720, and gave H5414 (8804) him the sword H2719 of Goliath H1555 the Philistine H6430.
022:011 Then the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) to call H7121 (8800) Ahimelech H0288 the priest H3548, the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285, and all his father’s H0001 house H1004, the priests H3548 that [were] in Nob H5011: and they came H0935 (8799) all of them to the king H4428.
022:012 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) now, thou son H1121 of Ahitub H0285. And he answered H0559 (8799), Here I [am], my lord H0113.
022:013 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why have ye conspired H7194 (8804) against me, thou and the son H1121 of Jesse H3448, in that thou hast given H5414 (8800) him bread H3899, and a sword H2719, and hast enquired H7592 (8800) of God H0430 for him, that he should rise H6965 (8800) against me, to lie in wait H0693 (8802), as at this day H3117?
022:014 Then Ahimelech H0288 answered H6030 (8799) the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), And who [is so] faithful H0539 (8737) among all thy servants H5650 as David H1732, which is the king’s H4428 son in law H2860, and goeth H5493 (8804) at thy bidding H4928, and is honourable H3513 (8737) in thine house H1004?
022:015 Did I then H3117 begin H2490 (8689) to enquire H7592 (8800) of God H0430 for him? be it far from me H2486: let not the king H4428 impute H7760 (8799) [any] thing H1697 unto his servant H5650, [nor] to all the house H1004 of my father H0001: for thy servant H5650 knew H3045 (8804) nothing H1697 of all this, less H6996 or more H1419.
022:016 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799), Ahimelech H0288, thou, and all thy father’s H0001 house H1004.
022:017 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto the footmen H7323 (8801) that stood H5324 (8737) about him, Turn H5437 (8798), and slay H4191 (8685) the priests H3548 of the LORD H3068; because their hand H3027 also [is] with David H1732, and because they knew H3045 (8804) when he fled H1272 (8802), and did not shew H1540 (8804) H0241 it to me. But the servants H5650 of the king H4428 would H0014 (8804) not put forth H7971 (8800) their hand H3027 to fall H6293 (8800) upon the priests H3548 of the LORD H3068.
022:018 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) to Doeg H1673, Turn H5437 (8798) thou, and fall H6293 (8798) upon the priests H3548. And Doeg H1673 the Edomite H0130 turned H5437 (8735), and he fell H6293 (8799) upon the priests H3548, and slew H4191 (8686) on that day H3117 fourscore H8084 and five H2568 persons H0376 that did wear H5375 (8802) a linen H0906 ephod H0646.
022:019 And Nob H5011, the city H5892 of the priests H3548, smote H5221 (8689) he with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, both men H0376 and women H0802, children H5768 and sucklings H3243 (8802), and oxen H7794, and asses H2543, and sheep H7716, with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
022:020 And one H0259 of the sons H1121 of Ahimelech H0288 the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285, named H8034 Abiathar H0054, escaped H4422 (8735), and fled H1272 (8799) after H0310 David H1732.
022:021 And Abiathar H0054 shewed H5046 (8686) David H1732 that Saul H7586 had slain H2026 (8804) the LORD’S H3068 priests H3548.
022:022 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Abiathar H0054, I knew H3045 (8804) [it] that day H3117, when Doeg H1673 the Edomite H0130 [was] there, that he would surely H5046 (8687) tell H5046 (8686) Saul H7586: I have occasioned H5437 (8804) [the death] of all the persons H5315 of thy father’s H0001 house H1004.
022:023 Abide H3427 (8798) thou with me, fear H3372 (8799) not: for he that seeketh H1245 (8762) my life H5315 seeketh H1245 (8762) thy life H5315: but with me thou [shalt be] in safeguard H4931.
023:001 ¶ Then they told H5046 (8686) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, the Philistines H6430 fight H3898 (8737) against Keilah H7084, and they rob H8154 (8802) the threshingfloors H1637.
023:002 Therefore David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I go H3212 (8799) and smite H5221 (8689) these Philistines H6430? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Go H3212 (8798), and smite H5221 (8689) the Philistines H6430, and save H3467 (8689) Keilah H7084.
023:003 And David’s H1732 men H0582 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, we be afraid H3373 here in Judah H3063: how much more then if we come H3212 (8799) to Keilah H7084 against the armies H4634 of the Philistines H6430?
023:004 Then David H1732 enquired H7592 (8800) of the LORD H3068 yet again H3254 (8686). And the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8799) him and said H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798), go down H3381 (8798) to Keilah H7084; for I will deliver H5414 (8802) the Philistines H6430 into thine hand H3027.
023:005 So David H1732 and his men H0582 went H3212 (8799) to Keilah H7084, and fought H3898 (8735) with the Philistines H6430, and brought away H5090 (8799) their cattle H4735, and smote H5221 (8686) them with a great H1419 slaughter H4347. So David H1732 saved H3467 (8686) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Keilah H7084.
023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar H0054 the son H1121 of Ahimelech H0288 fled H1272 (8800) to David H1732 to Keilah H7084, [that] he came down H3381 (8804) [with] an ephod H0646 in his hand H3027.
023:007 And it was told H5046 (8714) Saul H7586 that David H1732 was come H0935 (8804) to Keilah H7084. And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath delivered H5234 (8765) him into mine hand H3027; for he is shut in H5462 (8738), by entering H0935 (8800) into a town H5892 that hath gates H1817 and bars H1280.
023:008 And Saul H7586 called H8085 all the people H5971 together H8085 (8762) to war H4421, to go down H3381 (8800) to Keilah H7084, to besiege H6696 (8800) David H1732 and his men H0582.
023:009 And David H1732 knew H3045 (8799) that Saul H7586 secretly practised H2790 (8688) mischief H7451 against him; and he said H0559 (8799) to Abiathar H0054 the priest H3548, Bring hither H5066 (8685) the ephod H0646.
023:010 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, thy servant H5650 hath certainly H8085 (8800) heard H8085 (8804) that Saul H7586 seeketh H1245 (8764) to come H0935 (8800) to Keilah H7084, to destroy H7843 (8763) the city H5892 for my sake.
023:011 Will the men H1167 of Keilah H7084 deliver me up H5462 (8686) into his hand H3027? will Saul H7586 come down H3381 (8799), as thy servant H5650 hath heard H8085 (8804)? O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, I beseech thee, tell H5046 (8685) thy servant H5650. And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), He will come down H3381 (8799).
023:012 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732, Will the men H1167 of Keilah H7084 deliver H5462 (8686) me and my men H0582 into the hand H3027 of Saul H7586? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), They will deliver [thee] up H5462 (8686).
023:013 Then David H1732 and his men H0582, [which were] about six H8337 hundred H3967 H0376, arose H6965 (8799) and departed H3318 (8799) out of Keilah H7084, and went H1980 (8691) whithersoever H0834 they could go H1980 (8691). And it was told H5046 (8717) Saul H7586 that David H1732 was escaped H4422 (8738) from Keilah H7084; and he forbare H2308 (8799) to go forth H3318 (8800).
023:014 And David H1732 abode H3427 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 in strong holds H4679, and remained H3427 (8799) in a mountain H2022 in the wilderness H4057 of Ziph H2128. And Saul H7586 sought H1245 (8762) him every day H3117, but God H0430 delivered H5414 (8804) him not into his hand H3027.
023:015 And David H1732 saw H7200 (8799) that Saul H7586 was come out H3318 (8804) to seek H1245 (8763) his life H5315: and David H1732 [was] in the wilderness H4057 of Ziph H2128 in a wood H2793.
023:016 And Jonathan H3083 Saul’s H7586 son H1121 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to David H1732 into the wood H2793, and strengthened H2388 (8762) his hand H3027 in God H0430.
023:017 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Fear H3372 (8799) not: for the hand H3027 of Saul H7586 my father H0001 shall not find H4672 (8799) thee; and thou shalt be king H4427 (8799) over Israel H3478, and I shall be next H4932 unto thee; and that also Saul H7586 my father H0001 knoweth H3045 (8802).
023:018 And they two H8147 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and David H1732 abode H3427 (8799) in the wood H2793, and Jonathan H3083 went H1980 (8804) to his house H1004.
023:019 Then came up H5927 (8799) the Ziphites H2130 to Saul H7586 to Gibeah H1390, saying H0559 (8800), Doth not David H1732 hide H5641 (8693) himself with us in strong holds H4679 in the wood H2793, in the hill H1389 of Hachilah H2444, which [is] on the south H3225 of Jeshimon H3452?
023:020 Now therefore, O king H4428, come down H3381 (8798) according to all the desire H0185 of thy soul H5315 to come down H3381 (8800); and our part [shall be] to deliver H5462 (8687) him into the king’s H4428 hand H3027.
023:021 And Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] ye of the LORD H3068; for ye have compassion H2550 (8804) on me.
023:022 Go H3212 (8798), I pray you, prepare H3559 (8685) yet, and know H3045 (8798) and see H7200 (8798) his place H4725 where his haunt H7272 is, [and] who hath seen H7200 (8804) him there: for it is told H0559 (8804) me [that] he dealeth very H6191 (8800) subtilly H6191 (8686).
023:023 See H7200 (8798) therefore, and take knowledge H3045 (8798) of all the lurking places H4224 where he hideth H2244 (8691) himself, and come ye again H7725 (8804) to me with the certainty H3559 (8737), and I will go H1980 (8804) with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be H3426 in the land H0776, that I will search H2664 (8765) him out throughout all the thousands H0505 of Judah H3063.
023:024 And they arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Ziph H2128 before H6440 Saul H7586: but David H1732 and his men H0582 [were] in the wilderness H4057 of Maon H4584, in the plain H6160 on the south H3225 of Jeshimon H3452.
023:025 Saul H7586 also and his men H0582 went H3212 (8799) to seek H1245 (8763) [him]. And they told H5046 (8686) David H1732: wherefore he came down H3381 (8799) into a rock H5553, and abode H3427 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 of Maon H4584. And when Saul H7586 heard H8085 (8799) [that], he pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 David H1732 in the wilderness H4057 of Maon H4584.
023:026 And Saul H7586 went H3212 (8799) on this side H6654 of the mountain H2022, and David H1732 and his men H0582 on that side H6654 of the mountain H2022: and David H1732 made haste H2648 (8737) to get away H3212 (8800) for fear H6440 of Saul H7586; for Saul H7586 and his men H0582 compassed H5849 David H1732 and his men H0582 round about H5849 (8802) to take H8610 (8800) them.
023:027 But there came H0935 (8804) a messenger H4397 unto Saul H7586, saying H0559 (8800), Haste H4116 (8761) thee, and come H3212 (8798); for the Philistines H6430 have invaded H6584 (8804) the land H0776.
023:028 Wherefore Saul H7586 returned H7725 (8799) from pursuing H7291 (8800) after H0310 David H1732, and went H3212 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Philistines H6430: therefore they called H7121 (8804) that place H4725 Selahammahlekoth H5555.
023:029 And David H1732 went up H5927 (8799) from thence, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in strong holds H4679 at Engedi H5872.
024:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when Saul H7586 was returned H7725 (8804) from following H0310 the Philistines H6430, that it was told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, David H1732 [is] in the wilderness H4057 of Engedi H5872.
024:002 Then Saul H7586 took H3947 (8799) three H7969 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376 out of all Israel H3478, and went H3212 (8799) to seek H1245 (8763) David H1732 and his men H0582 upon H6440 the rocks H6697 of the wild goats H3277.
024:003 And he came H0935 (8799) to the sheepcotes H1448 H6629 by the way H1870, where [was] a cave H4631; and Saul H7586 went in H0935 (8799) to cover H5526 (8687) his feet H7272: and David H1732 and his men H0582 remained H3427 (8802) in the sides H3411 of the cave H4631.
024:004 And the men H0582 of David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold the day H3117 of which the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto thee, Behold, I will deliver H5414 (8802) thine enemy H0341 (8802) into thine hand H3027, that thou mayest do H6213 (8804) to him as it shall seem good H3190 (8799) unto thee H5869. Then David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and cut off H3772 (8799) the skirt H3671 of Saul’s H7586 robe H4598 privily H3909.
024:005 And it came to pass afterward H0310, that David’s H1732 heart H3820 smote H5221 (8686) him, because he had cut off H3772 (8804) Saul’s H7586 skirt H3671.
024:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his men H0582, The LORD H3068 forbid H2486 that I should do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697 unto my master H0113, the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899, to stretch forth H7971 (8800) mine hand H3027 against him, seeing he [is] the anointed H4899 of the LORD H3068.
024:007 So David H1732 stayed H8156 (8762) his servants H0582 with these words H1697, and suffered H5414 (8804) them not to rise H6965 (8800) against Saul H7586. But Saul H7586 rose up H6965 (8804) out of the cave H4631, and went H3212 (8799) on [his] way H1870.
024:008 David H1732 also arose H6965 (8799) afterward, and went out H3318 (8799) of the cave H4631, and cried H7121 (8799) after H0310 Saul H7586, saying H0559 (8800), My lord H0113 the king H4428. And when Saul H7586 looked H5027 (8686) behind H0310 him, David H1732 stooped H6915 (8799) with his face H0639 to the earth H0776, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself.
024:009 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, Wherefore hearest H8085 (8799) thou men’s H0120 words H1697, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, David H1732 seeketh H1245 (8764) thy hurt H7451?
024:010 Behold, this day H3117 thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804) how that the LORD H3068 had delivered H5414 (8804) thee to day H3117 into mine hand H3027 in the cave H4631: and [some] bade H0559 (8804) [me] kill H2026 (8800) thee: but [mine eye] spared H2347 (8799) thee; and I said H0559 (8799), I will not put forth H7971 (8799) mine hand H3027 against my lord H0113; for he [is] the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899.
024:011 Moreover, my father H0001, see H7200 (8798), yea, see H7200 (8798) the skirt H3671 of thy robe H4598 in my hand H3027: for in that I cut off H3772 (8800) the skirt H3671 of thy robe H4598, and killed H2026 (8804) thee not, know H3045 (8798) thou and see H7200 (8798) that [there is] neither evil H7451 nor transgression H6588 in mine hand H3027, and I have not sinned H2398 (8804) against thee; yet thou huntest H6658 (8802) my soul H5315 to take H3947 (8800) it.
024:012 The LORD H3068 judge H8199 (8799) between me and thee, and the LORD H3068 avenge H5358 (8804) me of thee: but mine hand H3027 shall not be upon thee.
024:013 As saith H0559 (8799) the proverb H4912 of the ancients H6931, Wickedness H7562 proceedeth H3318 (8799) from the wicked H7563: but mine hand H3027 shall not be upon thee.
024:014 After H0310 whom is the king H4428 of Israel H3478 come out H3318 (8804)? after H0310 whom dost thou pursue H7291 (8802)? after H0310 a dead H4191 (8801) dog H3611, after H0310 a H0259 flea H6550.
024:015 The LORD H3068 therefore be judge H1781, and judge H8199 (8804) between me and thee, and see H7200 (8799), and plead H7378 (8799) my cause H7379, and deliver H8199 (8799) me out of thine hand H3027.
024:016 And it came to pass, when David H1732 had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) these words H1697 unto Saul H7586, that Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799), [Is] this thy voice H6963, my son H1121 David H1732? And Saul H7586 lifted up H5375 (8799) his voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
024:017 And he said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Thou [art] more righteous H6662 than I: for thou hast rewarded H1580 (8804) me good H2896, whereas I have rewarded H1580 (8804) thee evil H7451.
024:018 And thou hast shewed H5046 (8689) this day H3117 how that thou hast dealt H6213 (8804) well H2896 with me: forasmuch as when the LORD H3068 had delivered H5462 (8765) me into thine hand H3027, thou killedst H2026 (8804) me not.
024:019 For if a man H0376 find H4672 (8799) his enemy H0341 (8802), will he let him go H7971 (8765) well H2896 away H1870? wherefore the LORD H3068 reward H7999 (8762) thee good H2896 for that thou hast done H6213 (8804) unto me this day H3117.
024:020 And now, behold, I know well H3045 (8804) that thou shalt surely H4427 (8800) be king H4427 (8799), and that the kingdom H4467 of Israel H3478 shall be established H6965 (8804) in thine hand H3027.
024:021 Swear H7650 (8734) now therefore unto me by the LORD H3068, that thou wilt not H0518 cut off H3772 (8686) my seed H2233 after H0310 me, and that thou wilt not destroy H8045 (8686) my name H8034 out of my father’s H0001 house H1004.
024:022 And David H1732 sware H7650 (8735) unto Saul H7586. And Saul H7586 went H3212 (8799) home H1004; but David H1732 and his men H0582 gat them up H5927 (8804) unto the hold H4686.
025:001 ¶ And Samuel H8050 died H4191 (8799); and all the Israelites H3478 were gathered together H6908 (8735), and lamented H5594 (8799) him, and buried H6912 (8799) him in his house H1004 at Ramah H7414. And David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and went down H3381 (8799) to the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290.
025:002 And [there was] a man H0376 in Maon H4584, whose possessions H4639 [were] in Carmel H3760; and the man H0376 [was] very H3966 great H1419, and he had three H7969 thousand H0505 sheep H6629, and a thousand H0505 goats H5795: and he was shearing H1494 (8800) his sheep H6629 in Carmel H3760.
025:003 Now the name H8034 of the man H0376 [was] Nabal H5037; and the name H8034 of his wife H0802 Abigail H0026: and [she was] a woman H0802 of good H2896 understanding H7922, and of a beautiful H3303 countenance H8389: but the man H0376 [was] churlish H7186 and evil H7451 in his doings H4611; and he [was] of the house of Caleb H3614.
025:004 And David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 that Nabal H5037 did shear H1494 (8802) his sheep H6629.
025:005 And David H1732 sent out H7971 (8799) ten H6235 young men H5288, and David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the young men H5288, Get you up H5927 (8798) to Carmel H3760, and go H0935 (8804) to Nabal H5037, and greet H7592 (8804) H7965 him in my name H8034:
025:006 And thus shall ye say H0559 (8804) to him that liveth H2416 [in prosperity], Peace H7965 [be] both to thee, and peace H7965 [be] to thine house H1004, and peace H7965 [be] unto all that thou hast.
025:007 And now I have heard H8085 (8804) that thou hast shearers H1494 (8802): now thy shepherds H7462 (8802) which were with us, we hurt H3637 (8689) them not, neither was there ought H3972 missing H6485 (8738) unto them, all the while H3117 they were in Carmel H3760.
025:008 Ask H7592 (8798) thy young men H5288, and they will shew H5046 (8686) thee. Wherefore let the young men H5288 find H4672 (8799) favour H2580 in thine eyes H5869: for we come H0935 (8804) in a good H2896 day H3117: give H5414 (8798), I pray thee, whatsoever cometh H4672 (8799) to thine hand H3027 unto thy servants H5650, and to thy son H1121 David H1732.
025:009 And when David’s H1732 young men H5288 came H0935 (8799), they spake H1696 (8762) to Nabal H5037 according to all those words H1697 in the name H8034 of David H1732, and ceased H5117 (8799).
025:010 And Nabal H5037 answered H6030 (8799) David’s H1732 servants H5650, and said H0559 (8799), Who [is] David H1732? and who [is] the son H1121 of Jesse H3448? there be many H7231 (8804) servants H5650 now a days H3117 that break away H6555 (8693) every man H0376 from H6440 his master H0113.
025:011 Shall I then take H3947 (8804) my bread H3899, and my water H4325, and my flesh H2878 that I have killed H2873 (8804) for my shearers H1494 (8802), and give H5414 (8804) [it] unto men H0582, whom I know H3045 (8804) not whence they [be]?
025:012 So David’s H1732 young men H5288 turned H2015 (8799) their way H1870, and went again H7725 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) him all those sayings H1697.
025:013 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto his men H0582, Gird ye on H2296 (8798) every man H0376 his sword H2719. And they girded on H2296 (8799) every man H0376 his sword H2719; and David H1732 also girded on H2296 (8799) his sword H2719: and there went up H5927 (8799) after H0310 David H1732 about four H0702 hundred H3967 men H0376; and two hundred H3967 abode H3427 (8804) by the stuff H3627.
025:014 But one H0259 of the young men H5288 told H5046 (8689) Abigail H0026, Nabal’s H5037 wife H0802, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, David H1732 sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 out of the wilderness H4057 to salute H1288 (8763) our master H0113; and he railed H5860 (8799) on them.
025:015 But the men H0582 [were] very H3966 good H2896 unto us, and we were not hurt H3637 (8717), neither missed H6485 (8804) we any thing H3972, as long as H3117 we were conversant H1980 (8694) with them, when we were in the fields H7704:
025:016 They were a wall H2346 unto us both by night H3915 and day H3119, all the while H3117 we were with them keeping H7462 (8802) the sheep H6629.
025:017 Now therefore know H3045 (8798) and consider H7200 (8798) what thou wilt do H6213 (8799); for evil H7451 is determined H3615 (8804) against our master H0113, and against all his household H1004: for he [is such] a son H1121 of Belial H1100, that [a man] cannot speak H1696 (8763) to him.
025:018 Then Abigail H0026 made haste H4116 (8762), and took H3947 (8799) two hundred H3967 loaves H3899, and two H8147 bottles H5035 of wine H3196, and five H2568 sheep H6629 ready dressed H6213 (8803), and five H2568 measures H5429 of parched H7039 [corn], and an hundred H3967 clusters of raisins H6778, and two hundred H3967 cakes H1690 of figs, and laid H7760 (8799) [them] on asses H2543.
025:019 And she said H0559 (8799) unto her servants H5288, Go on H5674 (8798) before H6440 me; behold, I come H0935 (8802) after H0310 you. But she told H5046 (8689) not her husband H0376 Nabal H5037.
025:020 And it was [so, as] she rode H7392 (8802) on the ass H2543, that she came down H3381 (8802) by the covert H5643 of the hill H2022, and, behold, David H1732 and his men H0582 came down H3381 (8802) against H7125 (8800) her; and she met H6298 (8799) them.
025:021 Now David H1732 had said H0559 (8804), Surely in vain H8267 have I kept H8104 (8804) all that this H2088 [fellow] hath in the wilderness H4057, so that nothing H3972 was missed H6485 (8738) of all that [pertained] unto him: and he hath requited H7725 (8686) me evil H7451 for good H2896.
025:022 So H3541 and more H3254 (8686) also do H6213 (8799) God H0430 unto the enemies H0341 (8802) of David H1732, if I leave H7604 (8686) of all that [pertain] to him by H5704 the morning H1242 light H0216 any that pisseth H8366 (8688) against the wall H7023.
025:023 And when Abigail H0026 saw H7200 (8799) David H1732, she hasted H4116 (8762), and lighted off H3381 (8799) the ass H2543, and fell H5307 (8799) before H0639 David H1732 on her face H6440, and bowed H7812 (8691) herself to the ground H0776,
025:024 And fell H5307 (8799) at his feet H7272, and said H0559 (8799), Upon me, my lord H0113, [upon] me [let this] iniquity H5771 [be]: and let thine handmaid H0519, I pray thee, speak H1696 (8762) in thine audience H0241, and hear H8085 (8798) the words H1697 of thine handmaid H0589.
025:025 Let H7760 (8799) not my lord H0113, I pray thee, regard H3820 this man H0376 of Belial H1100, [even] Nabal H5037: for as his name H8034 [is], so [is] he; Nabal H5037 [is] his name H8034, and folly H5039 [is] with him: but I thine handmaid H0519 saw H7200 (8804) not the young men H5288 of my lord H0113, whom thou didst send H7971 (8804).
025:026 Now therefore, my lord H0113, [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, seeing the LORD H3068 hath withholden H4513 (8804) thee from coming H0935 (8800) to [shed] blood H1818, and from avenging H3467 (8687) thyself with thine own hand H3027, now let thine enemies H0341 (8802), and they that seek H1245 (8764) evil H7451 to my lord H0113, be as Nabal H5037.
025:027 And now this blessing H1293 which thine handmaid H8198 hath brought H0935 (8689) unto my lord H0113, let it even be given H5414 (8738) unto the young men H5288 that follow H1980 (8693) H7272 my lord H0113.
025:028 I pray thee, forgive H5375 (8798) the trespass H6588 of thine handmaid H0519: for the LORD H3068 will certainly H6213 (8800) make H6213 (8799) my lord H0113 a sure H0539 (8737) house H1004; because my lord H0113 fighteth H3898 (8737) the battles H4421 of the LORD H3068, and evil H7451 hath not been found H4672 (8735) in thee [all] thy days H3117.
025:029 Yet a man H0120 is risen H6965 (8799) to pursue H7291 (8800) thee, and to seek H1245 (8763) thy soul H5315: but the soul H5315 of my lord H0113 shall be bound H6887 (8803) in the bundle H6872 of life H2416 with the LORD H3068 thy God H0430; and the souls H5315 of thine enemies H0341 (8802), them shall he sling out H7049 (8762), [as out] of the middle H8432 H3709 of a sling H7050.
025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD H3068 shall have done H6213 (8799) to my lord H0113 according to all the good H2896 that he hath spoken H1696 (8765) concerning thee, and shall have appointed H6680 (8765) thee ruler H5057 over Israel H3478;
025:031 That this shall be no grief H6330 unto thee, nor offence H4383 of heart H3820 unto my lord H0113, either that thou hast shed H8210 (8800) blood H1818 causeless H2600, or that my lord H0113 hath avenged H3467 (8687) himself: but when the LORD H3068 shall have dealt well H3190 (8689) with my lord H0113, then remember H2142 (8804) thine handmaid H0519.
025:032 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abigail H0026, Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, which sent H7971 (8804) thee this day H3117 to meet H7125 (8800) me:
025:033 And blessed H1288 (8803) [be] thy advice H2940, and blessed H1288 (8803) [be] thou, which hast kept H3607 (8804) me this day H3117 from coming H0935 (8800) to [shed] blood H1818, and from avenging H3467 (8687) myself with mine own hand H3027.
025:034 For in very deed H0199, [as] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 liveth H2416, which hath kept me back H4513 (8804) from hurting H7489 (8687) thee, except H3884 thou hadst hasted H4116 (8765) and come H0935 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) me, surely there had not been left H3498 (8738) unto Nabal H5037 by the morning H1242 light H0216 any that pisseth H8366 (8688) against the wall H7023.
025:035 So David H1732 received H3947 (8799) of her hand H3027 [that] which she had brought H0935 (8689) him, and said H0559 (8804) unto her, Go up H5927 (8798) in peace H7965 to thine house H1004; see H7200 (8798), I have hearkened H8085 (8804) to thy voice H6963, and have accepted H5375 (8799) thy person H6440.
025:036 And Abigail H0026 came H0935 (8799) to Nabal H5037; and, behold, he held a feast H4960 in his house H1004, like the feast H4960 of a king H4428; and Nabal’s H5037 heart H3820 [was] merry H2896 within him, for he [was] very H3966 drunken H7910: wherefore she told H5046 (8689) him nothing H1697, less H6996 or more H1419, until the morning H1242 light H0216.
025:037 But it came to pass in the morning H1242, when the wine H3196 was gone out H3318 (8800) of Nabal H5037, and his wife H0802 had told H5046 (8686) him these things H1697, that his heart H3820 died H4191 (8799) within H7130 him, and he became [as] a stone H0068.
025:038 And it came to pass about ten H6235 days H3117 [after], that the LORD H3068 smote H5062 (8799) Nabal H5037, that he died H4191 (8799).
025:039 And when David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) that Nabal H5037 was dead H4191 (8804), he said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068, that hath pleaded H7378 (8804) the cause H7379 of my reproach H2781 from the hand H3027 of Nabal H5037, and hath kept H2820 (8804) his servant H5650 from evil H7451: for the LORD H3068 hath returned H7725 (8689) the wickedness H7451 of Nabal H5037 upon his own head H7218. And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) and communed H1696 (8762) with Abigail H0026, to take H3947 (8800) her to him to wife H0802.
025:040 And when the servants H5650 of David H1732 were come H0935 (8799) to Abigail H0026 to Carmel H3760, they spake H1696 (8762) unto her, saying H0559 (8800), David H1732 sent H7971 (8804) us unto thee, to take H3947 (8800) thee to him to wife H0802.
025:041 And she arose H6965 (8799), and bowed H7812 (8691) herself on [her] face H0639 to the earth H0776, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, [let] thine handmaid H0519 [be] a servant H8198 to wash H7364 (8800) the feet H7272 of the servants H5650 of my lord H0113.
025:042 And Abigail H0026 hasted H4116 (8762), and arose H6965 (8799), and rode H7392 (8799) upon an ass H2543, with five H2568 damsels H5291 of hers that went H1980 (8802) after H7272 her; and she went H3212 (8799) after H0310 the messengers H4397 of David H1732, and became his wife H0802.
025:043 David H1732 also took H3947 (8804) Ahinoam H0293 of Jezreel H3157; and they were also both H8147 of them his wives H0802.
025:044 But Saul H7586 had given H5414 (8804) Michal H4324 his daughter H1323, David’s H1732 wife H0802, to Phalti H6406 the son H1121 of Laish H3919, which [was] of Gallim H1554.
026:001 ¶ And the Ziphites H2130 came H0935 (8799) unto Saul H7586 to Gibeah H1390, saying H0559 (8800), Doth not David H1732 hide H5641 (8693) himself in the hill H1389 of Hachilah H2444, [which is] before H6440 Jeshimon H3452?
026:002 Then Saul H7586 arose H6965 (8799), and went down H3381 (8799) to the wilderness H4057 of Ziph H2128, having three H7969 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376 of Israel H3478 with him, to seek H1245 (8763) David H1732 in the wilderness H4057 of Ziph H2128.
026:003 And Saul H7586 pitched H2583 (8799) in the hill H1389 of Hachilah H2444, which [is] before H6440 Jeshimon H3452, by the way H1870. But David H1732 abode H3427 (8802) in the wilderness H4057, and he saw H7200 (8799) that Saul H7586 came H0935 (8804) after H0310 him into the wilderness H4057.
026:004 David H1732 therefore sent out H7971 (8799) spies H7270 (8764), and understood H3045 (8799) that Saul H7586 was come H0935 (8804) in very deed H3559 (8737).
026:005 And David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to the place H4725 where Saul H7586 had pitched H2583 (8804): and David H1732 beheld H7200 (8799) the place H4725 where Saul H7586 lay H7901 (8804), and Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369, the captain H8269 of his host H6635: and Saul H7586 lay H7901 (8802) in the trench H4570, and the people H5971 pitched H2583 (8802) round about H5439 him.
026:006 Then answered H6030 (8799) David H1732 and said H0559 (8799) to Ahimelech H0288 the Hittite H2850, and to Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870, brother H0251 to Joab H3097, saying H0559 (8800), Who will go down H3381 (8799) with me to Saul H7586 to the camp H4264? And Abishai H0052 said H0559 (8799), I will go down H3381 (8799) with thee.
026:007 So David H1732 and Abishai H0052 came H0935 (8799) to the people H5971 by night H3915: and, behold, Saul H7586 lay H7901 (8802) sleeping H3463 within the trench H4570, and his spear H2595 stuck H4600 (8803) in the ground H0776 at his bolster H4763: but Abner H0074 and the people H5971 lay H7901 (8802) round about H5439 him.
026:008 Then said H0559 (8799) Abishai H0052 to David H1732, God H0430 hath delivered H5462 (8765) thine enemy H0341 (8802) into thine hand H3027 this day H3117: now therefore let me smite H5221 (8686) him, I pray thee, with the spear H2595 even to the earth H0776 at once H6471 H0259, and I will not [smite] him the second time H8138 (8799).
026:009 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abishai H0052, Destroy H7843 (8686) him not: for who can stretch forth H7971 (8804) his hand H3027 against the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899, and be guiltless H5352 (8738)?
026:010 David H1732 said H0559 (8799) furthermore, [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, the LORD H3068 shall smite H5062 (8799) him; or his day H3117 shall come H0935 (8799) to die H4191 (8804); or he shall descend H3381 (8799) into battle H4421, and perish H5595 (8738).
026:011 The LORD H3068 forbid H2486 that I should stretch forth H7971 (8800) mine hand H3027 against the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899: but, I pray thee, take H3947 (8798) thou now the spear H2595 that [is] at his bolster H4763, and the cruse H6835 of water H4325, and let us go H3212 (8799).
026:012 So David H1732 took H3947 (8799) the spear H2595 and the cruse H6835 of water H4325 from Saul’s H7586 bolster H7226; and they gat them away H3212 (8799), and no man saw H7200 (8802) [it], nor knew H3045 (8802) [it], neither awaked H6974 (8688): for they [were] all asleep H3463; because a deep sleep H8639 from the LORD H3068 was fallen H5307 (8804) upon them.
026:013 Then David H1732 went over H5674 (8799) to the other side H5676, and stood H5975 (8799) on the top H7218 of an hill H2022 afar off H7350; a great H7227 space H4725 [being] between them:
026:014 And David H1732 cried H7121 (8799) to the people H5971, and to Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369, saying H0559 (8800), Answerest H6030 (8799) thou not, Abner H0074? Then Abner H0074 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Who [art] thou [that] criest H7121 (8804) to the king H4428?
026:015 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abner H0074, [Art] not thou a [valiant] man H0376? and who [is] like to thee in Israel H3478? wherefore then hast thou not kept H8104 (8804) thy lord H0113 the king H4428? for there came H0935 (8804) one H0259 of the people H5971 in to destroy H7843 (8687) the king H4428 thy lord H0113.
026:016 This thing H1697 [is] not good H2896 that thou hast done H6213 (8804). [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, ye [are] worthy H1121 to die H4194, because ye have not kept H8104 (8804) your master H0113, the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899. And now see H7200 (8798) where the king’s H4428 spear H2595 [is], and the cruse H6835 of water H4325 that [was] at his bolster H4763.
026:017 And Saul H7586 knew H5234 (8686) David’s H1732 voice H6963, and said H0559 (8799), [Is] this thy voice H6963, my son H1121 David H1732? And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), [It is] my voice H6963, my lord H0113, O king H4428.
026:018 And he said H0559 (8799), Wherefore doth my lord H0113 thus pursue H7291 (8802) after H0310 his servant H5650? for what have I done H6213 (8804)? or what evil H7451 [is] in mine hand H3027?
026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord H0113 the king H4428 hear H8085 (8799) the words H1697 of his servant H5650. If the LORD H3068 have stirred thee up H5496 (8689) against me, let him accept H7306 (8686) an offering H4503: but if [they be] the children H1121 of men H0120, cursed H0779 (8803) [be] they before H6440 the LORD H3068; for they have driven H1644 (8765) me out this day H3117 from abiding H5596 (8692) in the inheritance H5159 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798), serve H5647 (8798) other H0312 gods H0430.
026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood H1818 fall H5307 (8799) to the earth H0776 before the face H6440 of the LORD H3068: for the king H4428 of Israel H3478 is come out H3318 (8804) to seek H1245 (8763) a H0259 flea H6550, as when one doth hunt H7291 (8799) a partridge H7124 in the mountains H2022.
026:021 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586, I have sinned H2398 (8804): return H7725 (8798), my son H1121 David H1732: for I will no more do thee harm H7489 (8686), because my soul H5315 was precious H3365 (8804) in thine eyes H5869 this day H3117: behold, I have played the fool H5528 (8689), and have erred H7686 (8799) exceedingly H7235 (8687) H3966.
026:022 And David H1732 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Behold the king’s H4428 spear H2595! and let one H0259 of the young men H5288 come over H5674 (8799) and fetch H3947 (8799) it.
026:023 The LORD H3068 render H7725 (8686) to every man H0376 his righteousness H6666 and his faithfulness H0530: for the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8804) thee into [my] hand H3027 to day H3117, but I would H0014 (8804) not stretch forth H7971 (8800) mine hand H3027 against the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899.
026:024 And, behold, as thy life H5315 was much set by H1431 (8804) this day H3117 in mine eyes H5869, so let my life H5315 be much set by H1431 (8799) in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068, and let him deliver H5337 (8686) me out of all tribulation H6869.
026:025 Then Saul H7586 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] thou, my son H1121 David H1732: thou shalt both do H6213 (8799) great H6213 (8800) [things], and also shalt still H3201 (8800) prevail H3201 (8799). So David H1732 went H3212 (8799) on his way H1870, and Saul H7586 returned H7725 (8804) to his place H4725.
027:001 ¶ And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) in his heart H3820, I shall now perish H5595 (8735) one H0259 day H3117 by the hand H3027 of Saul H7586: [there is] nothing better H2896 for me than that H3588 I should speedily H4422 (8736) escape H4422 (8735) into the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430; and Saul H7586 shall despair H2976 (8738) of me, to seek H1245 (8763) me any more in any coast H1366 of Israel H3478: so shall I escape H4422 (8738) out of his hand H3027.
027:002 And David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and he passed over H5674 (8799) with the six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 that [were] with him unto Achish H0397, the son H1121 of Maoch H4582, king H4428 of Gath H1661.
027:003 And David H1732 dwelt H3427 (8799) with Achish H0397 at Gath H1661, he and his men H0582, every man H0376 with his household H1004, [even] David H1732 with his two H8147 wives H0802, Ahinoam H0293 the Jezreelitess H3159, and Abigail H0026 the Carmelitess H3762, Nabal’s H5037 wife H0802.
027:004 And it was told H5046 (8714) Saul H7586 that David H1732 was fled H1272 (8804) to Gath H1661: and he sought H1245 (8763) no more again H3254 (8804) (8675) H3254 (8686) for him.
027:005 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Achish H0397, If I have now found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thine eyes H5869, let them give H5414 (8799) me a place H4725 in some H0259 town H5892 in the country H7704, that I may dwell H3427 (8799) there: for why should thy servant H5650 dwell H3427 (8799) in the royal H4467 city H5892 with thee?
027:006 Then Achish H0397 gave H5414 (8799) him Ziklag H6860 that day H3117: wherefore Ziklag H6860 pertaineth unto the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 unto this day H3117.
027:007 And the time H4557 H3117 that David H1732 dwelt H3427 (8804) in the country H7704 of the Philistines H6430 was a full year H3117 and four H0702 months H2320.
027:008 And David H1732 and his men H0582 went up H5927 (8799), and invaded H6584 (8799) the Geshurites H1651, and the Gezrites H1511, and the Amalekites H6003: for those H2007 [nations were] of old H5769 the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776, as thou goest H0935 (8800) to Shur H7793, even unto the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
027:009 And David H1732 smote H5221 (8689) the land H0776, and left neither man H0376 nor woman H0802 alive H2421 (8762), and took away H3947 (8804) the sheep H6629, and the oxen H1241, and the asses H2543, and the camels H1581, and the apparel H0899, and returned H7725 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Achish H0397.
027:010 And Achish H0397 said H0559 (8799), Whither H0408 have ye made a road H6584 (8804) to day H3117? And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Against the south H5045 of Judah H3063, and against the south H5045 of the Jerahmeelites H3397, and against the south H5045 of the Kenites H7017.
027:011 And David H1732 saved H2421 (8762) neither man H0376 nor woman H0802 alive H2421 (8762), to bring H0935 (8687) [tidings] to Gath H1661, saying H0559 (8800), Lest they should tell H5046 (8686) on us, saying H0559 (8800), So did H6213 (8804) David H1732, and so [will be] his manner H4941 all the while H3117 he dwelleth H3427 (8804) in the country H7704 of the Philistines H6430.
027:012 And Achish H0397 believed H0539 (8686) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), He hath made his people H5971 Israel H3478 utterly H0887 (8687) to abhor H0887 (8689) him; therefore he shall be my servant H5650 for ever H5769.
028:001 ¶ And it came to pass in those days H3117, that the Philistines H6430 gathered H6908 their armies H4264 together H6908 (8799) for warfare H6635, to fight H3898 (8736) with Israel H3478. And Achish H0397 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Know H3045 (8799) thou assuredly H3045 (8800), that thou shalt go out H3318 (8799) with me to battle H4264, thou and thy men H0582.
028:002 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Achish H0397, Surely H3651 thou shalt know H3045 (8799) what thy servant H5650 can do H6213 (8799). And Achish H0397 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Therefore will I make H7760 (8799) thee keeper H8104 (8802) of mine head H7218 for ever H3117.
028:003 Now Samuel H8050 was dead H4191 (8804), and all Israel H3478 had lamented H5594 (8799) him, and buried H6912 (8799) him in Ramah H7414, even in his own city H5892. And Saul H7586 had put away H5493 (8689) those that had familiar spirits H0178, and the wizards H3049, out of the land H0776.
028:004 And the Philistines H6430 gathered themselves together H6908 (8735), and came H0935 (8799) and pitched H2583 (8799) in Shunem H7766: and Saul H7586 gathered H6908 all Israel H3478 together H6908 (8799), and they pitched H2583 (8799) in Gilboa H1533.
028:005 And when Saul H7586 saw H7200 (8799) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430, he was afraid H3372 (8799), and his heart H3820 greatly H3966 trembled H2729 (8799).
028:006 And when Saul H7586 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8804) him not, neither by dreams H2472, nor by Urim H0224, nor by prophets H5030.
028:007 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586 unto his servants H5650, Seek H1245 (8761) me a woman H0802 that hath H1172 a familiar spirit H0178, that I may go H3212 (8799) to her, and enquire H1875 (8799) of her. And his servants H5650 said H0559 (8799) to him, Behold, [there is] a woman H0802 that hath H1172 a familiar spirit H0178 at Endor H5874.
028:008 And Saul H7586 disguised H2664 (8691) himself, and put on H3847 (8799) other H0312 raiment H0899, and he went H3212 (8799), and two H8147 men H0582 with him, and they came H0935 (8799) to the woman H0802 by night H3915: and he said H0559 (8799), I pray thee, divine H7080 (8798) unto me by the familiar spirit H0178, and bring me [him] up H5927 (8685), whom I shall name H0559 (8799) unto thee.
028:009 And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, thou knowest H3045 (8804) what Saul H7586 hath done H6213 (8804), how he hath cut off H3772 (8689) those that have familiar spirits H0178, and the wizards H3049, out of the land H0776: wherefore then layest thou a snare H5367 (8693) for my life H5315, to cause me to die H4191 (8687)?
028:010 And Saul H7586 sware H7650 (8735) to her by the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, there shall H0518 no punishment H5771 happen H7136 (8799) to thee for this thing H1697.
028:011 Then said H0559 (8799) the woman H0802, Whom shall I bring up H5927 (8686) unto thee? And he said H0559 (8799), Bring me up H5927 (8685) Samuel H8050.
028:012 And when the woman H0802 saw H7200 (8799) Samuel H8050, she cried H2199 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963: and the woman H0802 spake H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, saying H0559 (8800), Why hast thou deceived H7411 (8765) me? for thou [art] Saul H7586.
028:013 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Be not afraid H3372 (8799): for what sawest H7200 (8804) thou? And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto Saul H7586, I saw H7200 (8804) gods H0430 ascending H5927 (8802) out of the earth H0776.
028:014 And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, What form H8389 [is] he of? And she said H0559 (8799), An old H2205 man H0376 cometh up H5927 (8802); and he [is] covered H5844 (8802) with a mantle H4598. And Saul H7586 perceived H3045 (8799) that it [was] Samuel H8050, and he stooped H6915 (8799) with [his] face H0639 to the ground H0776, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself.
028:015 And Samuel H8050 said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, Why hast thou disquieted H7264 (8689) me, to bring me up H5927 (8687)? And Saul H7586 answered H0559 (8799), I am sore H3966 distressed H6887 (8804); for the Philistines H6430 make war H3898 (8737) against me, and God H0430 is departed H5493 (8804) from me, and answereth H6030 (8804) me no more, neither by H3027 prophets H5030, nor by dreams H2472: therefore I have called H7121 (8799) thee, that thou mayest make known H3045 (8687) unto me what I shall do H6213 (8799).
028:016 Then said H0559 (8799) Samuel H8050, Wherefore then dost thou ask H7592 (8799) of me, seeing the LORD H3068 is departed H5493 (8804) from thee, and is become thine enemy H6145?
028:017 And the LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8799) to him, as he spake H1696 (8765) by me H3027: for the LORD H3068 hath rent H7167 (8799) the kingdom H4467 out of thine hand H3027, and given H5414 (8799) it to thy neighbour H7453, [even] to David H1732:
028:018 Because H0834 thou obeyedst H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, nor executedst H6213 (8804) his fierce H2740 wrath H0639 upon Amalek H6002, therefore hath the LORD H3068 done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697 unto thee this day H3117.
028:019 Moreover the LORD H3068 will also deliver H5414 (8799) Israel H3478 with thee into the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430: and to morrow H4279 [shalt] thou and thy sons H1121 [be] with me: the LORD H3068 also shall deliver H5414 (8799) the host H4264 of Israel H3478 into the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
028:020 Then Saul H7586 fell H5307 (8799) straightway H4116 (8762) all H4393 along H6967 on the earth H0776, and was sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8799), because of the words H1697 of Samuel H8050: and there was no strength H3581 in him; for he had eaten H0398 (8804) no bread H3899 all the day H3117, nor all the night H3915.
028:021 And the woman H0802 came H0935 (8799) unto Saul H7586, and saw H7200 (8799) that he was sore H3966 troubled H0926 (8738), and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, thine handmaid H8198 hath obeyed H8085 (8804) thy voice H6963, and I have put H7760 (8799) my life H5315 in my hand H3709, and have hearkened H8085 (8799) unto thy words H1697 which thou spakest H1696 (8765) unto me.
028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken H8085 (8798) thou also unto the voice H6963 of thine handmaid H8198, and let me set H7760 (8799) a morsel H6595 of bread H3899 before H6440 thee; and eat H0398 (8798), that thou mayest have strength H3581, when thou goest H3212 (8799) on thy way H1870.
028:023 But he refused H3985 (8762), and said H0559 (8799), I will not eat H0398 (8799). But his servants H5650, together with the woman H0802, compelled H6555 (8799) him; and he hearkened H8085 (8799) unto their voice H6963. So he arose H6965 (8799) from the earth H0776, and sat H3427 (8799) upon the bed H4296.
028:024 And the woman H0802 had a fat H4770 calf H5695 in the house H1004; and she hasted H4116 (8762), and killed H2076 (8799) it, and took H3947 (8799) flour H7058, and kneaded H3888 (8799) [it], and did bake H0644 (8799) unleavened bread H4682 thereof:
028:025 And she brought H5066 (8686) [it] before H6440 Saul H7586, and before H6440 his servants H5650; and they did eat H0398 (8799). Then they rose up H6965 (8799), and went away H3212 (8799) that night H3915.
029:001 ¶ Now the Philistines H6430 gathered together H6908 (8799) all their armies H4264 to Aphek H0663: and the Israelites H3478 pitched H2583 (8802) by a fountain H5869 which [is] in Jezreel H3157.
029:002 And the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 passed on H5674 (8802) by hundreds H3967, and by thousands H0505: but David H1732 and his men H0582 passed on H5674 (8802) in the rereward H0314 with Achish H0397.
029:003 Then said H0559 (8799) the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430, What [do] these Hebrews H5680 [here]? And Achish H0397 said H0559 (8799) unto the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430, [Is] not this David H1732, the servant H5650 of Saul H7586 the king H4428 of Israel H3478, which hath been with me these days H3117, or these years H8141, and I have found H4672 (8804) no fault H3972 in him since H3117 he fell H5307 (8800) [unto me] unto this day H3117?
029:004 And the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430 were wroth H7107 (8799) with him; and the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Make H7725 this fellow H0376 return H7725 (8685), that he may go again H7725 (8799) to his place H4725 which thou hast appointed H6485 (8689) him, and let him not go down H3381 (8799) with us to battle H4421, lest in the battle H4421 he be an adversary H7854 to us: for wherewith should he reconcile H7521 (8691) himself unto his master H0113? [should it] not [be] with the heads H7218 of these men H0582?
029:005 [Is] not this David H1732, of whom they sang H6030 (8799) one to another in dances H4246, saying H0559 (8800), Saul H7586 slew H5221 (8689) his thousands H0505, and David H1732 his ten thousands H7233?
029:006 Then Achish H0397 called H7121 (8799) David H1732, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Surely, [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, thou hast been upright H3477, and thy going out H3318 (8800) and thy coming in H0935 (8800) with me in the host H4264 [is] good H2896 in my sight H5869: for I have not found H4672 (8804) evil H7451 in thee since the day H3117 of thy coming H0935 (8800) unto me unto this day H3117: nevertheless the lords H5633 favour H2896 thee not H5869.
029:007 Wherefore now return H7725 (8798), and go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965, that thou displease H6213 (8799) H7451 H5869 not the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430.
029:008 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Achish H0397, But what have I done H6213 (8804)? and what hast thou found H4672 (8804) in thy servant H5650 so long as H3117 I have been with thee H6440 unto this day H3117, that I may not go H0935 (8799) fight H3898 (8738) against the enemies H0341 (8802) of my lord H0113 the king H4428?
029:009 And Achish H0397 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, I know H3045 (8804) that thou [art] good H2896 in my sight H5869, as an angel H4397 of God H0430: notwithstanding the princes H8269 of the Philistines H6430 have said H0559 (8804), He shall not go up H5927 (8799) with us to the battle H4421.
029:010 Wherefore now rise up early H7925 (8685) in the morning H1242 with thy master’s H0113 servants H5650 that are come H0935 (8804) with thee: and as soon as ye be up early H7925 (8689) in the morning H1242, and have light H0215 (8804), depart H3212 (8798).
029:011 So David H1732 and his men H0582 rose up early H7925 (8686) to depart H3212 (8800) in the morning H1242, to return H7725 (8800) into the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430. And the Philistines H6430 went up H5927 (8804) to Jezreel H3157.
030:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when David H1732 and his men H0582 were come H0935 (8800) to Ziklag H6860 on the third H7992 day H3117, that the Amalekites H6003 had invaded H6584 (8804) the south H5045, and Ziklag H6860, and smitten H5221 (8686) Ziklag H6860, and burned H8313 (8799) it with fire H0784;
030:002 And had taken the women H0802 captives H7617 (8799), that [were] therein: they slew H4191 (8689) not any H0376, either great H1419 or small H6996, but carried [them] away H5090 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) on their way H1870.
030:003 So David H1732 and his men H0582 came H0935 (8799) to the city H5892, and, behold, [it was] burned H8313 (8803) with fire H0784; and their wives H0802, and their sons H1121, and their daughters H1323, were taken captives H7617 (8738).
030:004 Then David H1732 and the people H5971 that [were] with him lifted up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963 and wept H1058 (8799), until they had no more power H3581 to weep H1058 (8800).
030:005 And David’s H1732 two H8147 wives H0802 were taken captives H7617 (8738), Ahinoam H0293 the Jezreelitess H3159, and Abigail H0026 the wife H0802 of Nabal H5037 the Carmelite H3761.
030:006 And David H1732 was greatly H3966 distressed H3334 (8799); for the people H5971 spake H0559 (8804) of stoning H5619 (8800) him, because the soul H5315 of all the people H5971 was grieved H4843 (8804), every man H0376 for his sons H1121 and for his daughters H1323: but David H1732 encouraged H2388 (8691) himself in the LORD H3068 his God H0430.
030:007 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abiathar H0054 the priest H3548, Ahimelech’s H0288 son H1121, I pray thee, bring me hither H5066 (8685) the ephod H0646. And Abiathar H0054 brought H5066 (8686) thither the ephod H0646 to David H1732.
030:008 And David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) at the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I pursue H7291 (8799) after H0310 this troop H1416? shall I overtake H5381 (8686) them? And he answered H0559 (8799) him, Pursue H7291 (8798): for thou shalt surely H5381 (8687) overtake H5381 (8686) [them], and without fail H5337 (8687) recover H5337 (8686) [all].
030:009 So David H1732 went H3212 (8799), he and the six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 that [were] with him, and came H0935 (8799) to the brook H5158 Besor H1308, where those that were left behind H3498 (8737) stayed H5975 (8804).
030:010 But David H1732 pursued H7291 (8799), he and four H0702 hundred H3967 men H0376: for two hundred H3967 abode behind H5975 (8799), which were so faint H6296 (8765) that they could not go over H5674 (8800) the brook H5158 Besor H1308.
030:011 And they found H4672 (8799) an Egyptian H0376 H4713 in the field H7704, and brought H3947 (8799) him to David H1732, and gave H5414 (8799) him bread H3899, and he did eat H0398 (8799); and they made him drink H8248 (8686) water H4325;
030:012 And they gave H5414 (8799) him a piece H6400 of a cake H1690 of figs, and two H8147 clusters of raisins H6778: and when he had eaten H0398 (8799), his spirit H7307 came again H7725 (8799) to him: for he had eaten H0398 (8804) no bread H3899, nor drunk H8354 (8804) [any] water H4325, three H7969 days H3117 and three H7969 nights H3915.
030:013 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, To whom [belongest] thou? and whence [art] thou? And he said H0559 (8799), I [am] a young man H5288 of Egypt H4713, servant H5650 to an Amalekite H0376 H6003; and my master H0113 left H5800 (8799) me, because three H7969 days H3117 agone I fell sick H2470 (8804).
030:014 We made an invasion H6584 (8804) [upon] the south H5045 of the Cherethites H3774, and upon [the coast] which [belongeth] to Judah H3063, and upon the south H5045 of Caleb H3612; and we burned H8313 (8804) Ziklag H6860 with fire H0784.
030:015 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to him, Canst thou bring me down H3381 (8686) to this company H1416? And he said H0559 (8799), Swear H7650 (8734) unto me by God H0430, that thou wilt neither kill H4191 (8686) me, nor H0518 deliver H5462 (8686) me into the hands H3027 of my master H0113, and I will bring thee down H3381 (8686) to this company H1416.
030:016 And when he had brought him down H3381 (8686), behold, [they were] spread abroad H5203 (8803) upon all H6440 the earth H0776, eating H0398 (8802) and drinking H8354 (8802), and dancing H2287 (8802), because of all the great H1419 spoil H7998 that they had taken H3947 (8804) out of the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430, and out of the land H0776 of Judah H3063.
030:017 And David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) them from the twilight H5399 even unto the evening H6153 of the next day H4283: and there escaped H4422 (8738) not a man H0376 of them, save four H0702 hundred H3967 young H5288 men H0376, which rode H7392 (8804) upon camels H1581, and fled H5127 (8799).
030:018 And David H1732 recovered H5337 (8686) all that the Amalekites H6002 had carried away H3947 (8804): and David H1732 rescued H5337 (8689) his two H8147 wives H0802.
030:019 And there was nothing lacking H5737 (8738) to them, neither H4480 small H6996 nor great H1419, neither sons H1121 nor daughters H1323, neither spoil H7998, nor any [thing] that they had taken H3947 (8804) to them: David H1732 recovered H7725 (8689) all.
030:020 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) all the flocks H6629 and the herds H1241, [which] they drave H5090 (8804) before H6440 those H1931 [other] cattle H4735, and said H0559 (8799), This [is] David’s H1732 spoil H7998.
030:021 And David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to the two hundred H3967 men H0582, which were so faint H6296 (8765) that they could not follow H3212 (8800) H0310 David H1732, whom they had made also to abide H3427 (8686) at the brook H5158 Besor H1308: and they went forth H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) David H1732, and to meet H7125 (8800) the people H5971 that [were] with him: and when David H1732 came near H5066 (8799) to the people H5971, he saluted H7592 (8799) H7965 them.
030:022 Then answered H6030 (8799) all the wicked H7451 men H0376 and [men] of Belial H1100, of those H0582 that went H1980 (8804) with David H1732, and said H0559 (8799), Because they went H1980 (8804) not with us, we will not give H5414 (8799) them [ought] of the spoil H7998 that we have recovered H5337 (8689), save to every man H0376 his wife H0802 and his children H1121, that they may lead [them] away H5090 (8799), and depart H3212 (8799).
030:023 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732, Ye shall not do so H6213 (8799), my brethren H0251, with that which the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) us, who hath preserved H8104 (8799) us, and delivered H5414 (8799) the company H1416 that came H0935 (8802) against us into our hand H3027.
030:024 For who will hearken H8085 (8799) unto you in this matter H1697? but as his part H2506 [is] that goeth down H3381 (8802) (8675) H3381 (8717) to the battle H4421, so [shall] his part H2506 [be] that tarrieth H3427 (8802) by the stuff H3627: they shall part H2505 (8799) alike H3162.
030:025 And it was [so] from that day H3117 forward H4605, that he made H7760 (8799) it a statute H2706 and an ordinance H4941 for Israel H3478 unto this day H3117.
030:026 And when David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to Ziklag H6860, he sent H7971 (8762) of the spoil H7998 unto the elders H2205 of Judah H3063, [even] to his friends H7453, saying H0559 (8800), Behold a present H1293 for you of the spoil H7998 of the enemies H0341 (8802) of the LORD H3068;
030:027 To [them] H0834 which [were] in Bethel H1008, and to [them] which [were] in south H5045 Ramoth H7418, and to [them] which [were] in Jattir H3492,
030:028 And to [them] which [were] in Aroer H6177, and to [them] which [were] in Siphmoth H8224, and to [them] which [were] in Eshtemoa H0851,
030:029 And to [them] which [were] in Rachal H7403, and to [them] which [were] in the cities H5892 of the Jerahmeelites H3397, and to [them] which [were] in the cities H5892 of the Kenites H7017,
030:030 And to [them] which [were] in Hormah H2767, and to [them] which [were] in Chorashan H3565, and to [them] which [were] in Athach H6269,
030:031 And to [them] which [were] in Hebron H2275, and to all the places H4725 where David H1732 himself and his men H0582 were wont to haunt H1980 (8694).
031:001 ¶ Now the Philistines H6430 fought H3898 (8737) against Israel H3478: and the men H0582 of Israel H3478 fled H5127 (8799) from before H6440 the Philistines H6430, and fell down H5307 (8799) slain H2491 in mount H2022 Gilboa H1533.
031:002 And the Philistines H6430 followed hard H1692 (8686) upon Saul H7586 and upon his sons H1121; and the Philistines H6430 slew H5221 (8686) Jonathan H3083, and Abinadab H0041, and Malchishua H4444, Saul’s H7586 sons H1121.
031:003 And the battle H4421 went sore H3513 (8799) against Saul H7586, and the archers H3384 (8688) H0582 H7198 hit H4672 (8799) him; and he was sore H3966 wounded H2342 (8799) of the archers H3384 (8688) H0582 H7198.
031:004 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586 unto his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, Draw H8025 (8798) thy sword H2719, and thrust me through H1856 (8798) therewith; lest these uncircumcised H6189 come H0935 (8799) and thrust me through H1856 (8804), and abuse H5953 (8694) me. But his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 would H0014 (8804) not; for he was sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8804). Therefore Saul H7586 took H3947 (8799) a sword H2719, and fell H5307 (8799) upon it.
031:005 And when his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 saw H7200 (8799) that Saul H7586 was dead H4191 (8804), he fell H5307 (8799) likewise upon his sword H2719, and died H4191 (8799) with him.
031:006 So Saul H7586 died H4191 (8799), and his three H7969 sons H1121, and his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, and all his men H0582, that same day H3117 together H3162.
031:007 And when the men H0582 of Israel H3478 that [were] on the other side H5676 of the valley H6010, and [they] that [were] on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383, saw H7200 (8799) that the men H0582 of Israel H3478 fled H5127 (8804), and that Saul H7586 and his sons H1121 were dead H4191 (8804), they forsook H5800 (8799) the cities H5892, and fled H5127 (8799); and the Philistines H6430 came H0935 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in them.
031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, when the Philistines H6430 came H0935 (8799) to strip H6584 (8763) the slain H2491, that they found H4672 (8799) Saul H7586 and his three H7969 sons H1121 fallen H5307 (8802) in mount H2022 Gilboa H1533.
031:009 And they cut off H3772 (8799) his head H7218, and stripped off H6584 (8686) his armour H3627, and sent H7971 (8762) into the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430 round about H5439, to publish H1319 (8763) [it in] the house H1004 of their idols H6091, and among the people H5971.
031:010 And they put H7760 (8799) his armour H3627 in the house H1004 of Ashtaroth H6252 (8677) H1045: and they fastened H8628 (8804) his body H1472 to the wall H2346 of Bethshan H1052.
031:011 And when the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 heard H8085 (8799) of that which the Philistines H6430 had done H6213 (8804) to Saul H7586;
031:012 All the valiant H2428 men H0376 (8677) H0381 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) all night H3915, and took H3947 (8799) the body H1472 of Saul H7586 and the bodies H1472 of his sons H1121 from the wall H2346 of Bethshan H1052, and came H0935 (8799) to Jabesh H3003, and burnt H8313 (8799) them there.
031:013 And they took H3947 (8799) their bones H6106, and buried H6912 (8799) [them] under a tree H0815 at Jabesh H3003, and fasted H6684 (8799) seven H7651 days H3117.
