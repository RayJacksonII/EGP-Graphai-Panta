001:001 ¶ Now it came to pass after H0310 the death H4194 of Saul H7586, when David H1732 was returned H7725 (8804) from the slaughter H5221 (8687) of the Amalekites H6002, and David H1732 had abode H3427 (8799) two H8147 days H3117 in Ziklag H6860;
001:002 It came even to pass on the third H7992 day H3117, that, behold, a man H0376 came H0935 (8802) out of the camp H4264 from Saul H7586 with his clothes H0899 rent H7167 (8803), and earth H0127 upon his head H7218: and [so] it was, when he came H0935 (8800) to David H1732, that he fell H5307 (8799) to the earth H0776, and did obeisance H7812 (8691).
001:003 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, From whence comest H0935 (8799) thou? And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Out of the camp H4264 of Israel H3478 am I escaped H4422 (8738).
001:004 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, How H4100 went the matter H1697? I pray thee, tell H5046 (8685) me. And he answered H0559 (8799), That the people H5971 are fled H5127 (8804) from the battle H4421, and many H7235 (8687) of the people H5971 also are fallen H5307 (8804) and dead H4191 (8799); and Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3083 his son H1121 are dead H4191 (8804) also.
001:005 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the young man H5288 that told H5046 (8688) him, How knowest H3045 (8804) thou that Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3083 his son H1121 be dead H4191 (8804)?
001:006 And the young man H5288 that told H5046 (8688) him said H0559 (8799), As I happened H7136 (8738) by chance H7122 (8736) upon mount H2022 Gilboa H1533, behold, Saul H7586 leaned H8172 (8737) upon his spear H2595; and, lo, the chariots H7393 and horsemen H1167 H6571 followed hard H1692 (8689) after him.
001:007 And when he looked H6437 (8799) behind H0310 him, he saw H7200 (8799) me, and called H7121 (8799) unto me. And I answered H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
001:008 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered H0559 (8799) him, I [am] an Amalekite H6003.
001:009 He said H0559 (8799) unto me again, Stand H5975 (8798), I pray thee, upon me, and slay H4191 (8786) me: for anguish H7661 is come H0270 (8804) upon me, because my life H5315 [is] yet whole in me.
001:010 So I stood H5975 (8799) upon him, and slew H4191 (8787) him, because I was sure H3045 (8804) that he could not live H2421 (8799) after H0310 that he was fallen H5307 (8800): and I took H3947 (8799) the crown H5145 that [was] upon his head H7218, and the bracelet H0685 that [was] on his arm H2220, and have brought H0935 (8686) them hither unto my lord H0113.
001:011 Then David H1732 took hold H2388 (8686) on his clothes H0899, and rent H7167 (8799) them; and likewise all the men H0582 that [were] with him:
001:012 And they mourned H5594 (8799), and wept H1058 (8799), and fasted H6684 (8799) until even H6153, for Saul H7586, and for Jonathan H3083 his son H1121, and for the people H5971 of the LORD H3068, and for the house H1004 of Israel H3478; because they were fallen H5307 (8804) by the sword H2719.
001:013 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the young man H5288 that told H5046 (8688) him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered H0559 (8799), I [am] the son H1121 of a stranger H0376 H1616, an Amalekite H6003.
001:014 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, How wast thou not afraid H3372 (8804) to stretch forth H7971 (8800) thine hand H3027 to destroy H7843 (8763) the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899?
001:015 And David H1732 called H7121 (8799) one H0259 of the young men H5288, and said H0559 (8799), Go near H5066 (8798), [and] fall H6293 (8798) upon him. And he smote H5221 (8686) him that he died H4191 (8799).
001:016 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thy blood H1818 [be] upon thy head H7218; for thy mouth H6310 hath testified H6030 (8804) against thee, saying H0559 (8800), I have slain H4191 (8790) the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899.
001:017 And David H1732 lamented H6969 (8787) with this lamentation H7015 over Saul H7586 and over Jonathan H3083 his son H1121:
001:018 (Also he bade H0559 (8799) them teach H3925 (8763) the children H1121 of Judah H3063 [the use of] the bow H7198: behold, [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of Jasher H3477.)
001:019 The beauty H6643 of Israel H3478 is slain H2491 upon thy high places H1116: how are the mighty H1368 fallen H5307 (8804)!
001:020 Tell H5046 (8686) [it] not in Gath H1661, publish H1319 (8762) [it] not in the streets H2351 of Askelon H0831; lest the daughters H1323 of the Philistines H6430 rejoice H8055 (8799), lest the daughters H1323 of the uncircumcised H6189 triumph H5937 (8799).
001:021 Ye mountains H2022 of Gilboa H1533, [let there be] no dew H2919, neither [let there be] rain H4306, upon you, nor fields H7704 of offerings H8641: for there the shield H4043 of the mighty H1368 is vilely cast away H1602 (8738), the shield H4043 of Saul H7586, [as though he had] not [been] anointed H4899 with oil H8081.
001:022 From the blood H1818 of the slain H2491, from the fat H2459 of the mighty H1368, the bow H7198 of Jonathan H3083 turned H7734 (8738) not back H0268, and the sword H2719 of Saul H7586 returned H7725 (8799) not empty H7387.
001:023 Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3083 [were] lovely H0157 (8737) and pleasant H5273 in their lives H2416, and in their death H4194 they were not divided H6504 (8738): they were swifter H7043 (8804) than eagles H5404, they were stronger H1396 (8804) than lions H0738.
001:024 Ye daughters H1323 of Israel H3478, weep over H1058 (8798) Saul H7586, who clothed H3847 (8688) you in scarlet H8144, with [other] delights H5730, who put H5927 (8688) on ornaments H5716 of gold H2091 upon your apparel H3830.
001:025 How are the mighty H1368 fallen H5307 (8804) in the midst H8432 of the battle H4421! O Jonathan H3083, [thou wast] slain H2491 in thine high places H1116.
001:026 I am distressed H6887 (8804) for thee, my brother H0251 Jonathan H3083: very H3966 pleasant H5276 (8804) hast thou been unto me: thy love H0160 to me was wonderful H6381 (8738), passing the love H0160 of women H0802.
001:027 How are the mighty H1368 fallen H5307 (8804), and the weapons H3627 of war H4421 perished H0006 (8799)!
002:001 ¶ And it came to pass after this H0310, that David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I go up H5927 (8799) into any H0259 of the cities H5892 of Judah H3063? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go up H5927 (8798). And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Whither shall I go up H5927 (8799)? And he said H0559 (8799), Unto Hebron H2275.
002:002 So David H1732 went up H5927 (8799) thither, and his two H8147 wives H0802 also, Ahinoam H0293 the Jezreelitess H3159, and Abigail H0026 Nabal’s H5037 wife H0802 the Carmelite H3761.
002:003 And his men H0582 that [were] with him did David H1732 bring up H5927 (8689), every man H0376 with his household H1004: and they dwelt H3427 (8799) in the cities H5892 of Hebron H2275.
002:004 And the men H0582 of Judah H3063 came H0935 (8799), and there they anointed H4886 (8799) David H1732 king H4428 over the house H1004 of Judah H3063. And they told H5046 (8686) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), [That] the men H0582 of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 [were they] that buried H6912 (8804) Saul H7586.
002:005 And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto the men H0582 of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] ye of the LORD H3068, that ye have shewed H6213 (8804) this kindness H2617 unto your lord H0113, [even] unto Saul H7586, and have buried H6912 (8799) him.
002:006 And now the LORD H3068 shew H6213 (8799) kindness H2617 and truth H0571 unto you: and I also will requite H6213 (8799) you this kindness H2896, because ye have done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697.
002:007 Therefore now let your hands H3027 be strengthened H2388 (8799), and be ye valiant H1121 H2428: for your master H0113 Saul H7586 is dead H4191 (8804), and also the house H1004 of Judah H3063 have anointed H4886 (8804) me king H4428 over them.
002:008 But Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369, captain H8269 of Saul’s H7586 host H6635, took H3947 (8804) Ishbosheth H0378 the son H1121 of Saul H7586, and brought him over H5674 (8686) to Mahanaim H4266;
002:009 And made him king H4427 (8686) over Gilead H1568, and over the Ashurites H0805, and over Jezreel H3157, and over Ephraim H0669, and over Benjamin H1144, and over all Israel H3478.
002:010 Ishbosheth H0378 Saul’s H7586 son H1121 [was] forty H0705 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800) over Israel H3478, and reigned H4427 (8804) two H8147 years H8141. But the house H1004 of Judah H3063 followed H0310 David H1732.
002:011 And the time H4557 H3117 that David H1732 was king H4428 in Hebron H2275 over the house H1004 of Judah H3063 was seven H7651 years H8141 and six H8337 months H2320.
002:012 And Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369, and the servants H5650 of Ishbosheth H0378 the son H1121 of Saul H7586, went out H3318 (8799) from Mahanaim H4266 to Gibeon H1391.
002:013 And Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870, and the servants H5650 of David H1732, went out H3318 (8804), and met H6298 (8799) together H3162 by the pool H1295 of Gibeon H1391: and they sat down H3427 (8799), the one on the one side of the pool H1295, and the other on the other side of the pool H1295.
002:014 And Abner H0074 said H0559 (8799) to Joab H3097, Let the young men H5288 now arise H6965 (8799), and play H7832 (8762) before H6440 us. And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799), Let them arise H6965 (8799).
002:015 Then there arose H6965 (8799) and went over H5674 (8799) by number H4557 twelve H8147 H6240 of Benjamin H1144, which [pertained] to Ishbosheth H0378 the son H1121 of Saul H7586, and twelve H8147 H6240 of the servants H5650 of David H1732.
002:016 And they caught H2388 (8686) every one H0376 his fellow H7453 by the head H7218, and [thrust] his sword H2719 in his fellow’s H7453 side H6654; so they fell down H5307 (8799) together H3162: wherefore that place H4725 was called H7121 (8799) Helkathhazzurim H2521, which [is] in Gibeon H1391.
002:017 And there was a very H3966 sore H7186 battle H4421 that day H3117; and Abner H0074 was beaten H5062 (8735), and the men H0582 of Israel H3478, before H6440 the servants H5650 of David H1732.
002:018 And there were three H7969 sons H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 there, Joab H3097, and Abishai H0052, and Asahel H6214: and Asahel H6214 [was as] light H7031 of foot H7272 as a H0259 wild H7704 roe H6643.
002:019 And Asahel H6214 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 Abner H0074; and in going H3212 (8800) he turned H5186 (8804) not to the right hand H3225 nor to the left H8040 from following H0310 Abner H0074.
002:020 Then Abner H0074 looked H6437 (8799) behind H0310 him, and said H0559 (8799), [Art] thou Asahel H6214? And he answered H0559 (8799), I [am].
002:021 And Abner H0074 said H0559 (8799) to him, Turn thee aside H5186 (8798) to thy right hand H3225 or to thy left H8040, and lay thee hold H0270 (8798) on one H0259 of the young men H5288, and take H3947 (8798) thee his armour H2488. But Asahel H6214 would H0014 (8804) not turn aside H5493 (8800) from following H0310 of him.
002:022 And Abner H0074 said H0559 (8800) again H3254 (8686) to Asahel H6214, Turn thee aside H5493 (8798) from following H0310 me: wherefore should I smite H5221 (8686) thee to the ground H0776? how then should I hold up H5375 (8799) my face H6440 to Joab H3097 thy brother H0251?
002:023 Howbeit he refused H3985 (8762) to turn aside H5493 (8800): wherefore Abner H0074 with the hinder end H0310 of the spear H2595 smote H5221 (8686) him under H0413 the fifth H2570 [rib], that the spear H2595 came out H3318 (8799) behind H0310 him; and he fell down H5307 (8799) there, and died H4191 (8799) in the same place H8478: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came H0935 (8802) to the place H4725 where Asahel H6214 fell down H5307 (8804) and died H4191 (8799) stood still H5975 (8799).
002:024 Joab H3097 also and Abishai H0052 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 Abner H0074: and the sun H8121 went down H0935 (8804) when they were come H0935 (8804) to the hill H1389 of Ammah H0522, that [lieth] before H6440 Giah H1520 by the way H1870 of the wilderness H4057 of Gibeon H1391.
002:025 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 gathered themselves together H6908 (8691) after H0310 Abner H0074, and became one H0259 troop H0092, and stood H5975 (8799) on the top H7218 of an hill H1389.
002:026 Then Abner H0074 called H7121 (8799) to Joab H3097, and said H0559 (8799), Shall the sword H2719 devour H0398 (8799) for ever H5331? knowest H3045 (8804) thou not that it will be bitterness H4751 in the latter end H0314? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid H0559 (8799) the people H5971 return H7725 (8800) from following H0310 their brethren H0251?
002:027 And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799), [As] God H0430 liveth H2416, unless H3884 thou hadst spoken H1696 (8765), surely then in the morning H1242 the people H5971 had gone up H5927 (8738) every one H0376 from following H0310 his brother H0251.
002:028 So Joab H3097 blew H8628 (8799) a trumpet H7782, and all the people H5971 stood still H5975 (8799), and pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 Israel H3478 no more, neither fought H3898 (8736) they any more H3254 (8804).
002:029 And Abner H0074 and his men H0582 walked H1980 (8804) all that night H3915 through the plain H6160, and passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, and went through H3212 (8799) all Bithron H1338, and they came H0935 (8799) to Mahanaim H4266.
002:030 And Joab H3097 returned H7725 (8804) from following H0310 Abner H0074: and when he had gathered H6908 all the people H5971 together H6908 (8799), there lacked H6485 (8735) of David’s H1732 servants H5650 nineteen H8672 H6240 men H0376 and Asahel H6214.
002:031 But the servants H5650 of David H1732 had smitten H5221 (8689) of Benjamin H1144, and of Abner’s H0074 men H0582, [so that] three H7969 hundred H3967 and threescore H8346 men H0376 died H4191 (8804).
002:032 And they took up H5375 (8799) Asahel H6214, and buried H6912 (8799) him in the sepulchre H6913 of his father H0001, which [was in] Bethlehem H1035. And Joab H3097 and his men H0582 went H3212 (8799) all night H3915, and they came to Hebron H2275 at break of day H0215 (8735).
003:001 ¶ Now there was long H0752 war H4421 between the house H1004 of Saul H7586 and the house H1004 of David H1732: but David H1732 waxed H1980 (8802) stronger H2390 and stronger H2390, and the house H1004 of Saul H7586 waxed H1980 (8802) weaker H1800 and weaker H1800.
003:002 And unto David H1732 were sons H1121 born H3205 (8735) (8675) H3205 (8795) in Hebron H2275: and his firstborn H1060 was Amnon H0550, of Ahinoam H0293 the Jezreelitess H3159;
003:003 And his second H4932, Chileab H3609, of Abigail H0026 the wife H0802 of Nabal H5037 the Carmelite H3761; and the third H7992, Absalom H0053 the son H1121 of Maacah H4601 the daughter H1323 of Talmai H8526 king H4428 of Geshur H1650;
003:004 And the fourth H7243, Adonijah H0138 the son H1121 of Haggith H2294; and the fifth H2549, Shephatiah H8203 the son H1121 of Abital H0037;
003:005 And the sixth H8345, Ithream H3507, by Eglah H5698 David’s H1732 wife H0802. These were born H3205 (8795) to David H1732 in Hebron H2275.
003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war H4421 between the house H1004 of Saul H7586 and the house H1004 of David H1732, that Abner H0074 made himself strong H2388 (8693) for the house H1004 of Saul H7586.
003:007 And Saul H7586 had a concubine H6370, whose name H8034 [was] Rizpah H7532, the daughter H1323 of Aiah H0345: and [Ishbosheth] said H0559 (8799) to Abner H0074, Wherefore hast thou gone in H0935 (8804) unto my father’s H0001 concubine H6370?
003:008 Then was Abner H0074 very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799) for the words H1697 of Ishbosheth H0378, and said H0559 (8799), [Am] I a dog’s H3611 head H7218, which against Judah H3063 do shew H6213 (8799) kindness H2617 this day H3117 unto the house H1004 of Saul H7586 thy father H0001, to his brethren H0251, and to his friends H4828, and have not delivered H4672 (8689) thee into the hand H3027 of David H1732, that thou chargest H6485 (8799) me to day H3117 with a fault H5771 concerning this woman H0802?
003:009 So do H6213 (8799) God H0430 to Abner H0074, and more also H3254 (8686), except, as the LORD H3068 hath sworn H7650 (8738) to David H1732, even so I do H6213 (8799) to him;
003:010 To translate H5674 (8687) the kingdom H4467 from the house H1004 of Saul H7586, and to set up H6965 (8687) the throne H3678 of David H1732 over Israel H3478 and over Judah H3063, from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884.
003:011 And he could H3201 (8804) not answer H7725 (8687) Abner H0074 a word H1697 again, because he feared H3372 (8800) him.
003:012 And Abner H0074 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to David H1732 on his behalf, saying H0559 (8800), Whose [is] the land H0776? saying H0559 (8800) [also], Make H3772 (8798) thy league H1285 with me, and, behold, my hand H3027 [shall be] with thee, to bring about H5437 (8687) all Israel H3478 unto thee.
003:013 And he said H0559 (8799), Well H2896; I will make H3772 (8799) a league H1285 with thee: but one H0259 thing H1697 I require H7592 (8802) of thee, that is H0559 (8800), Thou shalt not see H7200 (8799) my face H6440, except thou first H6440 bring H0935 (8687) Michal H4324 Saul’s H7586 daughter H1323, when thou comest H0935 (8800) to see H7200 (8800) my face H6440.
003:014 And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to Ishbosheth H0378 Saul’s H7586 son H1121, saying H0559 (8800), Deliver H5414 (8798) [me] my wife H0802 Michal H4324, which I espoused H0781 (8765) to me for an hundred H3967 foreskins H6190 of the Philistines H6430.
003:015 And Ishbosheth H0378 sent H7971 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) her from [her] husband H0376, [even] from Phaltiel H6409 the son H1121 of Laish H3889 (8675) H3919.
003:016 And her husband H0376 went H3212 (8799) with her along weeping H1980 (8800) H1058 (8800) behind H0310 her to Bahurim H0980. Then said H0559 (8799) Abner H0074 unto him, Go H3212 (8798), return H7725 (8798). And he returned H7725 (8799).
003:017 And Abner H0074 had communication H1961 (8804) H1697 with the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Ye sought H1245 (8764) for David H1732 in times H8543 past H8032 [to be] king H4428 over you:
003:018 Now then do H6213 (8798) [it]: for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H0559 (8804) of David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), By the hand H3027 of my servant H5650 David H1732 I will save H3467 (8687) my people H5971 Israel H3478 out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430, and out of the hand H3027 of all their enemies H0341 (8802).
003:019 And Abner H0074 also spake H1696 (8762) in the ears H0241 of Benjamin H1144: and Abner H0074 went H3212 (8799) also to speak H1696 (8763) in the ears H0241 of David H1732 in Hebron H2275 all that seemed H5869 good H2896 to Israel H3478, and that seemed good H5869 to the whole house H1004 of Benjamin H1144.
003:020 So Abner H0074 came H0935 (8799) to David H1732 to Hebron H2275, and twenty H6242 men H0582 with him. And David H1732 made H6213 (8799) Abner H0074 and the men H0582 that [were] with him a feast H4960.
003:021 And Abner H0074 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, I will arise H6965 (8799) and go H3212 (8799), and will gather H6908 (8799) all Israel H3478 unto my lord H0113 the king H4428, that they may make H3772 (8799) a league H1285 with thee, and that thou mayest reign H4427 (8804) over all that thine heart H5315 desireth H0183 (8762). And David H1732 sent H7971 Abner H0074 away H7971 (8762); and he went H3212 (8799) in peace H7965.
003:022 And, behold, the servants H5650 of David H1732 and Joab H3097 came H0935 (8802) from [pursuing] a troop H1416, and brought in H0935 (8689) a great H7227 spoil H7998 with them: but Abner H0074 [was] not with David H1732 in Hebron H2275; for he had sent him away H7971 (8765), and he was gone H3212 (8799) in peace H7965.
003:023 When Joab H3097 and all the host H6635 that [was] with him were come H0935 (8804), they told H5046 (8686) Joab H3097, saying H0559 (8800), Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369 came H0935 (8804) to the king H4428, and he hath sent him away H7971 (8762), and he is gone H3212 (8799) in peace H7965.
003:024 Then Joab H3097 came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), What hast thou done H6213 (8804)? behold, Abner H0074 came H0935 (8802) unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away H7971 (8765), and he is quite H1980 (8800) gone H3212 (8799)?
003:025 Thou knowest H3045 (8804) Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369, that he came H0935 (8804) to deceive H6601 (8763) thee, and to know H3045 (8800) thy going out H4161 and thy coming in H4126 (8675) H3996, and to know H3045 (8800) all that thou doest H6213 (8802).
003:026 And when Joab H3097 was come out H3318 (8799) from David H1732, he sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 after H0310 Abner H0074, which brought him again H7725 (8686) from the well H0953 of Sirah H5626: but David H1732 knew H3045 (8804) [it] not.
003:027 And when Abner H0074 was returned H7725 (8799) to Hebron H2275, Joab H3097 took him aside H5186 (8686) in H0413 H8432 the gate H8179 to speak H1696 (8763) with him quietly H7987, and smote H5221 (8686) him there under the fifth H2570 [rib], that he died H4191 (8799), for the blood H1818 of Asahel H6214 his brother H0251.
003:028 And afterward H0310 when David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) [it], he said H0559 (8799), I and my kingdom H4467 [are] guiltless H5355 before the LORD H3068 for H5704 ever H5769 from the blood H1818 of Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369:
003:029 Let it rest H2342 (8799) on the head H7218 of Joab H3097, and on all his father’s H0001 house H1004; and let there not fail H3772 (8735) from the house H1004 of Joab H3097 one that hath an issue H2100 (8802), or that is a leper H6879 (8794), or that leaneth H2388 (8688) on a staff H6418, or that falleth H5307 (8802) on the sword H2719, or that lacketh H2638 bread H3899.
003:030 So Joab H3097 and Abishai H0052 his brother H0251 slew H2026 (8804) Abner H0074, because he had slain H4191 (8689) their brother H0251 Asahel H6214 at Gibeon H1391 in the battle H4421.
003:031 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Joab H3097, and to all the people H5971 that [were] with him, Rend H7167 (8798) your clothes H0899, and gird H2296 (8798) you with sackcloth H8242, and mourn H5594 (8798) before H6440 Abner H0074. And king H4428 David H1732 [himself] followed H1980 (8802) H0310 the bier H4296.
003:032 And they buried H6912 (8799) Abner H0074 in Hebron H2275: and the king H4428 lifted up H5375 (8799) his voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799) at the grave H6913 of Abner H0074; and all the people H5971 wept H1058 (8799).
003:033 And the king H4428 lamented H6969 (8787) over Abner H0074, and said H0559 (8799), Died H4191 (8799) Abner H0074 as a fool H5036 dieth H4194?
003:034 Thy hands H3027 [were] not bound H0631 (8803), nor thy feet H7272 put H5066 (8717) into fetters H5178: as a man falleth H5307 (8800) before H6440 wicked H5766 men H1121, [so] fellest H5307 (8804) thou. And all the people H5971 wept H1058 (8800) again H3254 (8686) over him.
003:035 And when all H3605 the people H5971 came H0935 (8799) to cause H1262 David H1732 to eat H1262 (8687) meat H3899 while it was yet H5750 day H3117, David H1732 sware H7650 (8735), saying H0559 (8800), So do H6213 (8799) God H0430 to me, and more also H3254 (8686), if I taste H2938 (8799) bread H3899, or ought H3972 else, till H6440 the sun H8121 be down H0935 (8800).
003:036 And all the people H5971 took notice H5234 (8689) [of it], and it pleased H3190 (8799) H5869 them: as whatsoever the king H4428 did H6213 (8804) pleased H5869 H2896 all the people H5971.
003:037 For all the people H5971 and all Israel H3478 understood H3045 (8799) that day H3117 that it was not of the king H4428 to slay H4191 (8687) Abner H0074 the son H1121 of Ner H5369.
003:038 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, Know H3045 (8799) ye not that there is a prince H8269 and a great man H1419 fallen H5307 (8804) this day H3117 in Israel H3478?
003:039 And I [am] this day H3117 weak H7390, though anointed H4886 (8803) king H4428; and these men H0582 the sons H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 [be] too hard H7186 for me: the LORD H3068 shall reward H7999 (8762) the doer of evil H6213 (8802) according to his wickedness H7451.
004:001 ¶ And when Saul’s H7586 son H1121 heard H8085 (8799) that Abner H0074 was dead H4191 (8804) in Hebron H2275, his hands H3027 were feeble H7503 (8799), and all the Israelites H3478 were troubled H0926 (8738).
004:002 And Saul’s H7586 son H1121 had H1961 (8804) two H8147 men H0582 [that were] captains H8269 of bands H1416: the name H8034 of the one H0259 [was] Baanah H1196, and the name H8034 of the other H8145 Rechab H7394, the sons H1121 of Rimmon H7417 a Beerothite H0886, of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144: (for Beeroth H0881 also was reckoned H2803 (8735) to Benjamin H1144:
004:003 And the Beerothites H0886 fled H1272 (8799) to Gittaim H1664, and were sojourners H1481 (8802) there until this day H3117.)
004:004 And Jonathan H3083, Saul’s H7586 son H1121, had a son H1121 [that was] lame H5223 of [his] feet H7272. He was five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when the tidings H8052 came H0935 (8800) of Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3083 out of Jezreel H3157, and his nurse H0539 (8802) took him up H5375 (8799), and fled H5127 (8799): and it came to pass, as she made haste H2648 (8800) to flee H5127 (8800), that he fell H5307 (8799), and became lame H6452 (8735). And his name H8034 [was] Mephibosheth H4648.
004:005 And the sons H1121 of Rimmon H7417 the Beerothite H0886, Rechab H7394 and Baanah H1196, went H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) about the heat H2527 of the day H3117 to the house H1004 of Ishbosheth H0378, who lay H7901 (8802) on a bed H4904 at noon H6672.
004:006 And they came thither H0935 (8804) into the midst H8432 of the house H1004, [as though] they would have fetched H3947 (8802) wheat H2406; and they smote H5221 (8686) him under the fifth H2570 [rib]: and Rechab H7394 and Baanah H1196 his brother H0251 escaped H4422 (8738).
004:007 For when they came H0935 (8799) into the house H1004, he lay H7901 (8802) on his bed H4296 in his bedchamber H2315 H4904, and they smote H5221 (8686) him, and slew H4191 (8686) him, and beheaded H5493 (8686) him, and took H3947 (8799) his head H7218, and gat them away H3212 (8799) through H1870 the plain H6160 all night H3915.
004:008 And they brought H0935 (8686) the head H7218 of Ishbosheth H0378 unto David H1732 to Hebron H2275, and said H0559 (8799) to the king H4428, Behold the head H7218 of Ishbosheth H0378 the son H1121 of Saul H7586 thine enemy H0341 (8802), which sought H1245 (8765) thy life H5315; and the LORD H3068 hath H5414 (8799) avenged H5360 my lord H0113 the king H4428 this day H3117 of Saul H7586, and of his seed H2233.
004:009 And David H1732 answered H6030 (8799) Rechab H7394 and Baanah H1196 his brother H0251, the sons H1121 of Rimmon H7417 the Beerothite H0886, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, who hath redeemed H6299 (8804) my soul H5315 out of all adversity H6869,
004:010 When one told H5046 (8688) me, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, Saul H7586 is dead H4191 (8804), thinking to have brought H5869 good tidings H1319 (8764), I took hold H0270 (8799) of him, and slew H2026 (8799) him in Ziklag H6860, who [thought] that I would have given H5414 (8800) him a reward for his tidings H1309:
004:011 How much more, when wicked H7563 men H0582 have slain H2026 (8804) a righteous H6662 person H0376 in his own house H1004 upon his bed H4904? shall I not therefore now require H1245 (8762) his blood H1818 of your hand H3027, and take you away H1197 (8765) from the earth H0776?
004:012 And David H1732 commanded H6680 (8762) his young men H5288, and they slew H2026 (8799) them, and cut off H7112 (8762) their hands H3027 and their feet H7272, and hanged [them] up H8518 (8799) over the pool H1295 in Hebron H2275. But they took H3947 (8804) the head H7218 of Ishbosheth H0378, and buried H6912 (8799) [it] in the sepulchre H6913 of Abner H0074 in Hebron H2275.
005:001 ¶ Then came H0935 (8799) all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 to David H1732 unto Hebron H2275, and spake H0559 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), Behold, we [are] thy bone H6106 and thy flesh H1320.
005:002 Also in time past H0865 H8032, when Saul H7586 was king H4428 over us, thou wast he that leddest out H3318 (8688) and broughtest in H0935 (8688) Israel H3478: and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) to thee, Thou shalt feed H7462 (8799) my people H5971 Israel H3478, and thou shalt be a captain H5057 over Israel H3478.
005:003 So all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428 to Hebron H2275; and king H4428 David H1732 made H3772 (8799) a league H1285 with them in Hebron H2275 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and they anointed H4886 (8799) David H1732 king H4428 over Israel H3478.
005:004 David H1732 [was] thirty H7970 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), [and] he reigned H4427 (8804) forty H0705 years H8141.
005:005 In Hebron H2275 he reigned H4427 (8804) over Judah H3063 seven H7651 years H8141 and six H8337 months H2320: and in Jerusalem H3389 he reigned H4427 (8804) thirty H7970 and three H7969 years H8141 over all Israel H3478 and Judah H3063.
005:006 And the king H4428 and his men H0582 went H3212 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 unto the Jebusites H2983, the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776: which spake H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Except thou take away H5493 (8687) the blind H5787 and the lame H6455, thou shalt not come in H0935 (8799) hither: thinking H0559 (8800), David H1732 cannot come in H0935 (8799) hither.
005:007 Nevertheless David H1732 took H3920 (8799) the strong hold H4686 of Zion H6726: the same [is] the city H5892 of David H1732.
005:008 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) on that day H3117, Whosoever getteth up H5060 (8799) to the gutter H6794, and smiteth H5221 (8688) the Jebusites H2983, and the lame H6455 and the blind H5787, [that are] hated H8130 (8803) of David’s H1732 soul H5315, [he shall be chief and captain]. Wherefore they said H0559 (8799), The blind H5787 and the lame H6455 shall not come H0935 (8799) into the house H1004.
005:009 So David H1732 dwelt H3427 (8799) in the fort H4686, and called H7121 (8799) it the city H5892 of David H1732. And David H1732 built H1129 (8799) round about H5439 from Millo H4407 and inward H1004.
005:010 And David H1732 went H3212 (8799) on H1980 (8800), and grew great H1419, and the LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635 [was] with him.
005:011 And Hiram H2438 king H4428 of Tyre H6865 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to David H1732, and cedar H0730 trees H6086, and carpenters H2796, and masons H7023 H0068: and they built H1129 (8799) David H1732 an house H1004.
005:012 And David H1732 perceived H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 had established H3559 (8689) him king H4428 over Israel H3478, and that he had exalted H5375 (8765) his kingdom H4467 for his people H5971 Israel’s H3478 sake.
005:013 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) [him] more concubines H6370 and wives H0802 out of Jerusalem H3389, after H0310 he was come H0935 (8800) from Hebron H2275: and there were yet sons H1121 and daughters H1323 born H3205 (8735) to David H1732.
005:014 And these [be] the names H8034 of those that were born H3209 unto him in Jerusalem H3389; Shammua H8051, and Shobab H7727, and Nathan H5416, and Solomon H8010,
005:015 Ibhar H2984 also, and Elishua H0474, and Nepheg H5298, and Japhia H3309,
005:016 And Elishama H0476, and Eliada H0450, and Eliphalet H0467.
005:017 But when the Philistines H6430 heard H8085 (8799) that they had anointed H4886 (8804) David H1732 king H4428 over Israel H3478, all the Philistines H6430 came up H5927 (8799) to seek H1245 (8763) David H1732; and David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) [of it], and went down H3381 (8799) to the hold H4686.
005:018 The Philistines H6430 also came H0935 (8804) and spread H5203 (8735) themselves in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
005:019 And David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I go up H5927 (8799) to the Philistines H6430? wilt thou deliver H5414 (8799) them into mine hand H3027? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Go up H5927 (8798): for I will doubtless H5414 (8800) deliver H5414 (8799) the Philistines H6430 into thine hand H3027.
005:020 And David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to Baalperazim H1188, and David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) them there, and said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 hath broken forth H6555 (8804) upon mine enemies H0341 (8802) before H6440 me, as the breach H6556 of waters H4325. Therefore he called H7121 (8804) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Baalperazim H1188.
005:021 And there they left H5800 (8799) their images H6091, and David H1732 and his men H0582 burned H5375 (8799) them.
005:022 And the Philistines H6430 came up H5927 (8800) yet again H3254 (8686), and spread H5203 (8735) themselves in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
005:023 And when David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, he said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt not go up H5927 (8799); [but] fetch a compass H5437 (8685) behind H0310 them, and come H0935 (8804) upon them over against H4136 the mulberry trees H1057.
005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest H8085 (8800) the sound H6963 of a going H6807 in the tops H7218 of the mulberry trees H1057, that then thou shalt bestir H2782 (8799) thyself: for then shall the LORD H3068 go out H3318 (8804) before H6440 thee, to smite H5221 (8687) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430.
005:025 And David H1732 did so H6213 (8799), as the LORD H3068 had commanded H6680 (8765) him; and smote H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430 from Geba H1387 until thou come H0935 (8800) to Gazer H1507.
006:001 ¶ Again, David H1732 gathered together H0622 (8799) (8676) H3254 (8686) all [the] chosen H0977 (8803) [men] of Israel H3478, thirty H7970 thousand H0505.
006:002 And David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) with all the people H5971 that [were] with him from Baale of Judah H1184, to bring up H5927 (8687) from thence the ark H0727 of God H0430, whose name H8034 is called H7121 (8738) by the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 that dwelleth H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742.
006:003 And they set H7392 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430 upon a new H2319 cart H5699, and brought H5375 (8799) it out of the house H1004 of Abinadab H0041 that [was] in Gibeah H1390: and Uzzah H5798 and Ahio H0283, the sons H1121 of Abinadab H0041, drave H5090 (8802) the new H2319 cart H5699.
006:004 And they brought H5375 (8799) it out of the house H1004 of Abinadab H0041 which [was] at Gibeah H1390, accompanying H5973 the ark H0727 of God H0430: and Ahio H0283 went H1980 (8802) before H6440 the ark H0727.
006:005 And David H1732 and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 played H7832 (8764) before H6440 the LORD H3068 on all manner of [instruments made of] fir H1265 wood H6086, even on harps H3658, and on psalteries H5035, and on timbrels H8596, and on cornets H4517, and on cymbals H6767.
006:006 And when they came H0935 (8799) to Nachon’s H5225 threshingfloor H1637, Uzzah H5798 put forth H7971 (8799) [his hand] to the ark H0727 of God H0430, and took hold H0270 (8799) of it; for the oxen H1241 shook H8058 (8804) [it].
006:007 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Uzzah H5798; and God H0430 smote H5221 (8686) him there for [his] error H7944; and there he died H4191 (8799) by the ark H0727 of God H0430.
006:008 And David H1732 was displeased H2734 (8799), because the LORD H3068 had made H6555 (8804) a breach H6556 upon Uzzah H5798: and he called H7121 (8799) the name of the place H4725 Perezuzzah H6560 to this day H3117.
006:009 And David H1732 was afraid H3372 (8799) of the LORD H3068 that day H3117, and said H0559 (8799), How shall the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 come H0935 (8799) to me?
006:010 So David H1732 would H0014 (8804) not remove H5493 (8687) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 unto him into the city H5892 of David H1732: but David H1732 carried it aside H5186 (8686) into the house H1004 of Obededom H5654 the Gittite H1663.
006:011 And the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 continued H3427 (8799) in the house H1004 of Obededom H5654 the Gittite H1663 three H7969 months H2320: and the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8762) Obededom H5654, and all his household H1004.
006:012 And it was told H5046 (8714) king H4428 David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765) the house H1004 of Obededom H5654, and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of the ark H0727 of God H0430. So David H1732 went H3212 (8799) and brought up H5927 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430 from the house H1004 of Obededom H5654 into the city H5892 of David H1732 with gladness H8057.
006:013 And it was [so], that when they that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 had gone H6805 (8804) six H8337 paces H6806, he sacrificed H2076 (8799) oxen H7794 and fatlings H4806.
006:014 And David H1732 danced H3769 (8772) before H6440 the LORD H3068 with all [his] might H5797; and David H1732 [was] girded H2296 (8803) with a linen H0906 ephod H0646.
006:015 So David H1732 and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 brought up H5927 (8688) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 with shouting H8643, and with the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782.
006:016 And as the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8802) into the city H5892 of David H1732, Michal H4324 Saul’s H7586 daughter H1323 looked H8259 (8738) through a window H2474, and saw H7200 (8799) king H4428 David H1732 leaping H6339 (8764) and dancing H3769 (8772) before H6440 the LORD H3068; and she despised H0959 (8799) him in her heart H3820.
006:017 And they brought H0935 (8686) in the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, and set H3322 (8686) it in his place H4725, in the midst H8432 of the tabernacle H0168 that David H1732 had pitched H5186 (8804) for it: and David H1732 offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
006:018 And as soon as David H1732 had made an end H3615 (8762) of offering H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002, he blessed H1288 (8762) the people H5971 in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
006:019 And he dealt H2505 (8762) among all the people H5971, [even] among the whole multitude H1995 of Israel H3478, as well to the women H0802 as men H0376, to every one H0376 a H0259 cake H2471 of bread H3899, and a good piece H0829 [of flesh], and a flagon H0809 [of wine]. So all the people H5971 departed H3212 (8799) every one H0376 to his house H1004.
006:020 Then David H1732 returned H7725 (8799) to bless H1288 (8763) his household H1004. And Michal H4324 the daughter H1323 of Saul H7586 came out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) David H1732, and said H0559 (8799), How glorious H3513 (8738) was the king H4428 of Israel H3478 to day H3117, who uncovered H1540 (8738) himself to day H3117 in the eyes H5869 of the handmaids H0519 of his servants H5650, as one H0259 of the vain fellows H7386 shamelessly H1540 (8736) uncovereth H1540 (8736) himself!
006:021 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Michal H4324, [It was] before H6440 the LORD H3068, which chose H0977 (8804) me before thy father H0001, and before all his house H1004, to appoint H6680 (8763) me ruler H5057 over the people H5971 of the LORD H3068, over Israel H3478: therefore will I play H7832 (8765) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
006:022 And I will yet be more vile H7043 (8738) than thus H2063, and will be base H8217 in mine own sight H5869: and of the maidservants H0519 which thou hast spoken H0559 (8804) of, of them shall I be had in honour H3513 (8735).
006:023 Therefore Michal H4324 the daughter H1323 of Saul H7586 had no child H2056 (8675) H3206 unto the day H3117 of her death H4194.
007:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when the king H4428 sat H3427 (8804) in his house H1004, and the LORD H3068 had given him rest H5117 (8689) round about H5439 from all his enemies H0341 (8802);
007:002 That the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030, See H7200 (8798) now, I dwell H3427 (8802) in an house H1004 of cedar H0730, but the ark H0727 of God H0430 dwelleth H3427 (8802) within H8432 curtains H3407.
007:003 And Nathan H5416 said H0559 (8799) to the king H4428, Go H3212 (8798), do H6213 (8798) all that [is] in thine heart H3824; for the LORD H3068 [is] with thee.
007:004 And it came to pass that night H3915, that the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Nathan H5416, saying H0559 (8800),
007:005 Go H3212 (8798) and tell H0559 (8804) my servant H5650 David H1732, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Shalt thou build H1129 (8799) me an house H1004 for me to dwell in H3427 (8800)?
007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt H3427 (8804) in [any] house H1004 since the time H3117 that I brought up H5927 (8687) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 out of Egypt H4714, even to this day H3117, but have walked H1980 (8693) in a tent H0168 and in a tabernacle H4908.
007:007 In all [the places] wherein I have walked H1980 (8694) with all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 spake H1696 (8765) I a word H1697 with any H0259 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, whom I commanded H6680 (8765) to feed H7462 (8800) my people H5971 Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Why build H1129 (8804) ye not me an house H1004 of cedar H0730?
007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say H0559 (8799) unto my servant H5650 David H1732, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, I took H3947 (8804) thee from the sheepcote H5116, from following H0310 the sheep H6629, to be ruler H5057 over my people H5971, over Israel H3478:
007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest H1980 (8804), and have cut off H3772 (8686) all thine enemies H0341 (8802) out of thy sight H6440, and have made H6213 (8804) thee a great H1419 name H8034, like unto the name H8034 of the great H1419 [men] that [are] in the earth H0776.
007:010 Moreover I will appoint H7760 (8804) a place H4725 for my people H5971 Israel H3478, and will plant H5193 (8804) them, that they may dwell H7931 (8804) in a place of their own, and move H7264 (8799) no more; neither shall the children H1121 of wickedness H5766 afflict H6031 (8763) them any more H3254 (8686), as beforetime H7223,
007:011 And as since the time H3117 that I commanded H6680 (8765) judges H8199 (8802) [to be] over my people H5971 Israel H3478, and have caused thee to rest H5117 (8689) from all thine enemies H0341 (8802). Also the LORD H3068 telleth H5046 (8689) thee that he will make H6213 (8799) thee an house H1004.
007:012 And when thy days H3117 be fulfilled H4390 (8799), and thou shalt sleep H7901 (8804) with thy fathers H0001, I will set up H6965 (8689) thy seed H2233 after H0310 thee, which shall proceed H3318 (8799) out of thy bowels H4578, and I will establish H3559 (8689) his kingdom H4467.
007:013 He shall build H1129 (8799) an house H1004 for my name H8034, and I will stablish H3559 (8790) the throne H3678 of his kingdom H4467 for H5704 ever H5769.
007:014 I will be his father H0001, and he shall be my son H1121. If he commit iniquity H5753 (8687), I will chasten H3198 (8689) him with the rod H7626 of men H0582, and with the stripes H5061 of the children H1121 of men H0120:
007:015 But my mercy H2617 shall not depart away H5493 (8799) from him, as I took H5493 (8689) [it] from Saul H7586, whom I put away H5493 (8689) before H6440 thee.
007:016 And thine house H1004 and thy kingdom H4467 shall be established H0539 (8738) for H5704 ever H5769 before H6440 thee: thy throne H3678 shall be established H3559 (8737) for H5704 ever H5769.
007:017 According to all these words H1697, and according to all this vision H2384, so did Nathan H5416 speak H1696 (8765) unto David H1732.
007:018 Then went H0935 (8799) king H4428 David H1732 in, and sat H3427 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and he said H0559 (8799), Who [am] I, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069? and what [is] my house H1004, that thou hast brought H0935 (8689) me hitherto H1988?
007:019 And this was yet a small thing H6994 (8799) in thy sight H5869, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069; but thou hast spoken H1696 (8762) also of thy servant’s H5650 house H1004 for a great while to come H7350. And [is] this the manner H8452 of man H0120, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069?
007:020 And what can H3254 David H1732 say H1696 (8763) more H3254 (8686) unto thee? for thou, Lord H0136 GOD H3069, knowest H3045 (8804) thy servant H5650.
007:021 For thy word’s H1697 sake, and according to thine own heart H3820, hast thou done H6213 (8804) all these great things H1420, to make thy servant H5650 know H3045 (8687) [them].
007:022 Wherefore thou art great H1431 (8804), O LORD H3068 God H0430: for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God H0430 beside H2108 thee, according to all that we have heard H8085 (8804) with our ears H0241.
007:023 And what one H0259 nation H1471 in the earth H0776 [is] like thy people H5971, [even] like Israel H3478, whom God H0430 went H1980 (8804) to redeem H6299 (8800) for a people H5971 to himself, and to make H7760 (8800) him a name H8034, and to do H6213 (8800) for you great things H1420 and terrible H3372 (8737), for thy land H0776, before H6440 thy people H5971, which thou redeemedst H6299 (8804) to thee from Egypt H4714, [from] the nations H1471 and their gods H0430?
007:024 For thou hast confirmed H3559 (8787) to thyself thy people H5971 Israel H3478 [to be] a people H5971 unto thee for H5704 ever H5769: and thou, LORD H3068, art become H1961 (8804) their God H0430.
007:025 And now, O LORD H3068 God H0430, the word H1697 that thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) concerning thy servant H5650, and concerning his house H1004, establish H6965 (8685) [it] for H5704 ever H5769, and do H6213 (8798) as thou hast said H1696 (8765).
007:026 And let thy name H8034 be magnified H1431 (8799) for H5704 ever H5769, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] the God H0430 over Israel H3478: and let the house H1004 of thy servant H5650 David H1732 be established H3559 (8737) before H6440 thee.
007:027 For thou, O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, God H0430 of Israel H3478, hast revealed H1540 (8804) H0241 to thy servant H5650, saying H0559 (8800), I will build H1129 (8799) thee an house H1004: therefore hath thy servant H5650 found H4672 (8804) in his heart H3820 to pray H6419 (8692) this prayer H8605 unto thee.
007:028 And now, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, thou [art] that God H0430, and thy words H1697 be true H0571, and thou hast promised H1696 (8762) this goodness H2896 unto thy servant H5650:
007:029 Therefore now let it please H2974 (8685) thee to bless H1288 (8761) the house H1004 of thy servant H5650, that it may continue for ever H5769 before H6440 thee: for thou, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, hast spoken H1696 (8765) [it]: and with thy blessing H1293 let the house H1004 of thy servant H5650 be blessed H1288 (8792) for ever H5769.
008:001 ¶ And after H0310 this it came to pass, that David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430, and subdued H3665 (8686) them: and David H1732 took H3947 (8799) Methegammah H4965 out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
008:002 And he smote H5221 (8686) Moab H4124, and measured H4058 (8762) them with a line H2256, casting them down H7901 (8687) to the ground H0776; even with two H8147 lines H2256 measured H4058 (8762) he to put to death H4191 (8687), and with one full H4393 line H2256 to keep alive H2421 (8687). And [so] the Moabites H4124 became David’s H1732 servants H5650, [and] brought H5375 (8802) gifts H4503.
008:003 David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) also Hadadezer H1909, the son H1121 of Rehob H7340, king H4428 of Zobah H6678, as he went H3212 (8800) to recover H7725 (8687) his border H3027 at the river H5104 Euphrates H6578.
008:004 And David H1732 took H3920 (8799) from him a thousand H0505 [chariots], and seven H7651 hundred H3967 horsemen H6571, and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 footmen H0376 H7273: and David H1732 houghed H6131 (8762) all the chariot H7393 [horses], but reserved H3498 (8686) of them [for] an hundred H3967 chariots H7393.
008:005 And when the Syrians H0758 of Damascus H1834 came H0935 (8799) to succour H5826 (8800) Hadadezer H1909 king H4428 of Zobah H6678, David H1732 slew H5221 (8686) of the Syrians H0758 two H8147 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 men H0376.
008:006 Then David H1732 put H7760 (8799) garrisons H5333 in Syria H0758 of Damascus H1834: and the Syrians H0758 became servants H5650 to David H1732, [and] brought H5375 (8802) gifts H4503. And the LORD H3068 preserved H3467 (8686) David H1732 whithersoever he went H1980 (8804).
008:007 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) the shields H7982 of gold H2091 that were on the servants H5650 of Hadadezer H1909, and brought H0935 (8686) them to Jerusalem H3389.
008:008 And from Betah H0984, and from Berothai H1268, cities H5892 of Hadadezer H1909, king H4428 David H1732 took H3947 (8804) exceeding H3966 much H7235 (8687) brass H5178.
008:009 When Toi H8583 king H4428 of Hamath H2574 heard H8085 (8799) that David H1732 had smitten H5221 (8689) all the host H2428 of Hadadezer H1909,
008:010 Then Toi H8583 sent H7971 (8799) Joram H3141 his son H1121 unto king H4428 David H1732, to salute H7592 (8800) H7965 him, and to bless H1288 (8763) him, because he had fought H3898 (8738) against Hadadezer H1909, and smitten H5221 (8686) him: for Hadadezer H1909 had wars H0376 H4421 with Toi H8583. And [Joram] brought with him H3027 vessels H3627 of silver H3701, and vessels H3627 of gold H2091, and vessels H3627 of brass H5178:
008:011 Which also king H4428 David H1732 did dedicate H6942 (8689) unto the LORD H3068, with the silver H3701 and gold H2091 that he had dedicated H6942 (8689) of all nations H1471 which he subdued H3533 (8765);
008:012 Of Syria H0758, and of Moab H4124, and of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and of the Philistines H6430, and of Amalek H6002, and of the spoil H7998 of Hadadezer H1909, son H1121 of Rehob H7340, king H4428 of Zobah H6678.
008:013 And David H1732 gat H6213 (8799) [him] a name H8034 when he returned H7725 (8800) from smiting H5221 (8687) of the Syrians H0758 in the valley H1516 of salt H4417, [being] eighteen H8083 H6240 thousand H0505 [men].
008:014 And he put H7760 (8799) garrisons H5333 in Edom H0123; throughout all Edom H0123 put H7760 (8804) he garrisons H5333, and all they of Edom H0123 became David’s H1732 servants H5650. And the LORD H3068 preserved H3467 (8686) David H1732 whithersoever he went H1980 (8804).
008:015 And David H1732 reigned H4427 (8799) over all Israel H3478; and David H1732 executed H6213 (8802) judgment H4941 and justice H6666 unto all his people H5971.
008:016 And Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 [was] over the host H6635; and Jehoshaphat H3092 the son H1121 of Ahilud H0286 [was] recorder H2142 (8688);
008:017 And Zadok H6659 the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285, and Ahimelech H0288 the son H1121 of Abiathar H0054, [were] the priests H3548; and Seraiah H8304 [was] the scribe H5608 (8802);
008:018 And Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077 [was over] both the Cherethites H3774 and the Pelethites H6432; and David’s H1732 sons H1121 were chief rulers H3548.
009:001 ¶ And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Is there yet H3426 any that is left H3498 (8738) of the house H1004 of Saul H7586, that I may shew H6213 (8799) him kindness H2617 for Jonathan’s H3083 sake?
009:002 And [there was] of the house H1004 of Saul H7586 a servant H5650 whose name H8034 [was] Ziba H6717. And when they had called H7121 (8799) him unto David H1732, the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Art] thou Ziba H6717? And he said H0559 (8799), Thy servant H5650 [is he].
009:003 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), [Is] there not H0657 yet any H0376 of the house H1004 of Saul H7586, that I may shew H6213 (8799) the kindness H2617 of God H0430 unto him? And Ziba H6717 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Jonathan H3083 hath yet a son H1121, [which is] lame H5223 on [his] feet H7272.
009:004 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Where H0375 [is] he? And Ziba H6717 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Behold, he [is] in the house H1004 of Machir H4353, the son H1121 of Ammiel H5988, in Lodebar H3810.
009:005 Then king H4428 David H1732 sent H7971 (8799), and fetched H3947 (8799) him out of the house H1004 of Machir H4353, the son H1121 of Ammiel H5988, from Lodebar H3810.
009:006 Now when Mephibosheth H4648, the son H1121 of Jonathan H3083, the son H1121 of Saul H7586, was come H0935 (8799) unto David H1732, he fell H5307 (8799) on his face H6440, and did reverence H7812 (8691). And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Mephibosheth H4648. And he answered H0559 (8799), Behold thy servant H5650!
009:007 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Fear H3372 (8799) not: for I will surely H6213 (8800) shew H6213 (8799) thee kindness H2617 for Jonathan H3083 thy father’s H0001 sake, and will restore H7725 (8689) thee all the land H7704 of Saul H7586 thy father H0001; and thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 at my table H7979 continually H8548.
009:008 And he bowed H7812 (8691) himself, and said H0559 (8799), What [is] thy servant H5650, that thou shouldest look H6437 (8804) upon such a dead H4191 (8801) dog H3611 as I [am]?
009:009 Then the king H4428 called H7121 (8799) to Ziba H6717, Saul’s H7586 servant H5288, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, I have given H5414 (8804) unto thy master’s H0113 son H1121 all that pertained H1961 (8804) to Saul H7586 and to all his house H1004.
009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons H1121, and thy servants H5650, shall till H5647 (8804) the land H0127 for him, and thou shalt bring H0935 (8689) in [the fruits], that thy master’s H0113 son H1121 may have food H3899 to eat H0398 (8804): but Mephibosheth H4648 thy master’s H0113 son H1121 shall eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 alway H8548 at my table H7979. Now Ziba H6717 had fifteen H2568 H6240 sons H1121 and twenty H6242 servants H5650.
009:011 Then said H0559 (8799) Ziba H6717 unto the king H4428, According to all that my lord H0113 the king H4428 hath commanded H6680 (8762) his servant H5650, so shall thy servant H5650 do H6213 (8799). As for Mephibosheth H4648, [said the king], he shall eat H0398 (8802) at my table H7979, as one H0259 of the king’s H4428 sons H1121.
009:012 And Mephibosheth H4648 had a young H6996 son H1121, whose name H8034 [was] Micha H4316. And all that dwelt H4186 in the house H1004 of Ziba H6717 [were] servants H5650 unto Mephibosheth H4648.
009:013 So Mephibosheth H4648 dwelt H3427 (8802) in Jerusalem H3389: for he did eat H0398 (8802) continually H8548 at the king’s H4428 table H7979; and was lame H6455 on both H8147 his feet H7272.
010:001 ¶ And it came to pass after this H0310, that the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 died H4191 (8799), and Hanun H2586 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
010:002 Then said H0559 (8799) David H1732, I will shew H6213 (8799) kindness H2617 unto Hanun H2586 the son H1121 of Nahash H5176, as his father H0001 shewed H6213 (8804) kindness H2617 unto me. And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) to comfort H5162 (8763) him by the hand H3027 of his servants H5650 for his father H0001. And David’s H1732 servants H5650 came H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
010:003 And the princes H8269 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 said H0559 (8799) unto Hanun H2586 their lord H0113, Thinkest H5869 thou that David H1732 doth honour H3513 (8764) thy father H0001, that he hath sent H7971 (8804) comforters H5162 (8764) unto thee? hath not David H1732 [rather] sent H7971 (8804) his servants H5650 unto thee, to H5668 search H2713 (8800) the city H5892, and to spy it out H7270 (8763), and to overthrow H2015 (8800) it?
010:004 Wherefore Hanun H2586 took H3947 (8799) David’s H1732 servants H5650, and shaved off H1548 (8762) the one half H2677 of their beards H2206, and cut off H3772 (8799) their garments H4063 in the middle H2677, [even] to their buttocks H8357, and sent them away H7971 (8762).
010:005 When they told H5046 (8686) [it] unto David H1732, he sent H7971 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them, because the men H0582 were greatly H3966 ashamed H3637 (8737): and the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Tarry H3427 (8798) at Jericho H3405 until your beards H2206 be grown H6779 (8762), and [then] return H7725 (8804).
010:006 And when the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 saw H7200 (8799) that they stank H0887 (8738) before David H1732, the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 sent H7971 (8799) and hired H7936 (8799) the Syrians H0758 of Bethrehob H1050, and the Syrians H0758 of Zoba H6678, twenty H6242 thousand H0505 footmen H7273, and of king H4428 Maacah H4601 a thousand H0505 men H0376, and of Ishtob H0382 twelve H6240 H8147 thousand H0505 men H0376.
010:007 And when David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) of [it], he sent H7971 (8799) Joab H3097, and all the host H6635 of the mighty men H1368.
010:008 And the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 came out H3318 (8799), and put the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8799) at the entering in H6607 of the gate H8179: and the Syrians H0758 of Zoba H6678, and of Rehob H7340, and Ishtob H0382, and Maacah H4601, [were] by themselves H0905 in the field H7704.
010:009 When Joab H3097 saw H7200 (8799) that the front H6440 of the battle H4421 was against him before H6440 and behind H0268, he chose H0977 (8799) of all the choice H0977 (8803) [men] of Israel H3478, and put [them] in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Syrians H0758:
010:010 And the rest H3499 of the people H5971 he delivered H5414 (8804) into the hand H3027 of Abishai H0052 his brother H0251, that he might put [them] in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
010:011 And he said H0559 (8799), If the Syrians H0758 be too strong H2388 (8799) for me, then thou shalt help H3444 me: but if the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 be too strong H2388 (8799) for thee, then I will come H1980 (8804) and help H3467 (8687) thee.
010:012 Be of good courage H2388 (8798), and let us play the men H2388 (8691) for our people H5971, and for the cities H5892 of our God H0430: and the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) that which seemeth H5869 him good H2896.
010:013 And Joab H3097 drew nigh H5066 (8799), and the people H5971 that [were] with him, unto the battle H4421 against the Syrians H0758: and they fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 him.
010:014 And when the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 saw H7200 (8804) that the Syrians H0758 were fled H5127 (8804), then fled H5127 (8799) they also before H6440 Abishai H0052, and entered H0935 (8799) into the city H5892. So Joab H3097 returned H7725 (8799) from the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
010:015 And when the Syrians H0758 saw H7200 (8799) that they were smitten H5062 (8738) before H6440 Israel H3478, they gathered H0622 (8735) themselves together H3162.
010:016 And Hadarezer H1928 sent H7971 (8799), and brought out H3318 (8686) the Syrians H0758 that [were] beyond H5676 the river H5104: and they came H0935 (8799) to Helam H2431; and Shobach H7731 the captain H8269 of the host H6635 of Hadarezer H1928 [went] before H6440 them.
010:017 And when it was told H5046 (8714) David H1732, he gathered H0622 all Israel H3478 together H0622 (8799), and passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, and came H0935 (8799) to Helam H2431. And the Syrians H0758 set themselves in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) David H1732, and fought H3898 (8735) with him.
010:018 And the Syrians H0758 fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 Israel H3478; and David H1732 slew H2026 (8799) [the men of] seven H7651 hundred H3967 chariots H7393 of the Syrians H0758, and forty H0705 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571, and smote H5221 (8689) Shobach H7731 the captain H8269 of their host H6635, who died H4191 (8799) there.
010:019 And when all the kings H4428 [that were] servants H5650 to Hadarezer H1928 saw H7200 (8799) that they were smitten H5062 (8738) before H6440 Israel H3478, they made peace H7999 (8686) with Israel H3478, and served H5647 (8799) them. So the Syrians H0758 feared H3372 (8799) to help H3467 (8687) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 any more.
011:001 ¶ And it came to pass, after the year H8141 was expired H8666, at the time H6256 when kings H4428 (8675) H4397 go forth H3318 (8800) [to battle], that David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) Joab H3097, and his servants H5650 with him, and all Israel H3478; and they destroyed H7843 (8686) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and besieged H6696 (8799) Rabbah H7237. But David H1732 tarried still H3427 (8802) at Jerusalem H3389.
011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide H6153 H6256, that David H1732 arose H6965 (8799) from off his bed H4904, and walked H1980 (8691) upon the roof H1406 of the king’s H4428 house H1004: and from the roof H1406 he saw H7200 (8799) a woman H0802 washing H7364 (8801) herself; and the woman H0802 [was] very H3966 beautiful H2896 to look upon H4758.
011:003 And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) and enquired H1875 (8799) after the woman H0802. And [one] said H0559 (8799), [Is] not this Bathsheba H1339, the daughter H1323 of Eliam H0463, the wife H0802 of Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850?
011:004 And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397, and took H3947 (8799) her; and she came in H0935 (8799) unto him, and he lay H7901 (8799) with her; for she was purified H6942 (8693) from her uncleanness H2932: and she returned H7725 (8799) unto her house H1004.
011:005 And the woman H0802 conceived H2029 (8799), and sent H7971 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) David H1732, and said H0559 (8799), I [am] with child H2030.
011:006 And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) to Joab H3097, [saying], Send H7971 (8798) me Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850. And Joab H3097 sent H7971 (8799) Uriah H0223 to David H1732.
011:007 And when Uriah H0223 was come H0935 (8799) unto him, David H1732 demanded H7592 (8799) [of him] how Joab H3097 did H7965, and how the people H5971 did H7965, and how the war H4421 prospered H7965.
011:008 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Uriah H0223, Go down H3381 (8798) to thy house H1004, and wash H7364 (8798) thy feet H7272. And Uriah H0223 departed out H3318 (8799) of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and there followed H0310 him a mess H4864 [of meat] from the king H4428.
011:009 But Uriah H0223 slept H7901 (8799) at the door H6607 of the king’s H4428 house H1004 with all the servants H5650 of his lord H0113, and went not down H3381 (8804) to his house H1004.
011:010 And when they had told H5046 (8686) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Uriah H0223 went not down H3381 (8804) unto his house H1004, David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Uriah H0223, Camest H0935 (8802) thou not from [thy] journey H1870? why [then] didst thou not go down H3381 (8804) unto thine house H1004?
011:011 And Uriah H0223 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, The ark H0727, and Israel H3478, and Judah H3063, abide H3427 (8802) in tents H5521; and my lord H0113 Joab H3097, and the servants H5650 of my lord H0113, are encamped H2583 (8802) in the open H6440 fields H7704; shall I H0589 then go H0935 (8799) into mine house H1004, to eat H0398 (8800) and to drink H8354 (8800), and to lie H7901 (8800) with my wife H0802? [as] thou livest H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, I will not do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697.
011:012 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Uriah H0223, Tarry H3427 (8798) here to day H3117 also, and to morrow H4279 I will let thee depart H7971 (8762). So Uriah H0223 abode H3427 (8799) in Jerusalem H3389 that day H3117, and the morrow H4283.
011:013 And when David H1732 had called H7121 (8799) him, he did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799) before H6440 him; and he made him drunk H7937 (8762): and at even H6153 he went out H3318 (8799) to lie H7901 (8800) on his bed H4904 with the servants H5650 of his lord H0113, but went not down H3381 (8804) to his house H1004.
011:014 And it came to pass in the morning H1242, that David H1732 wrote H3789 (8799) a letter H5612 to Joab H3097, and sent H7971 (8799) [it] by the hand H3027 of Uriah H0223.
011:015 And he wrote H3789 (8799) in the letter H5612, saying H0559 (8800), Set H3051 (8798) ye Uriah H0223 in the forefront H6440 H4136 of the hottest H2389 battle H4421, and retire H7725 (8804) ye from him H0310, that he may be smitten H5221 (8738), and die H4191 (8804).
011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab H3097 observed H8104 (8800) the city H5892, that he assigned H5414 (8799) Uriah H0223 unto a place H4725 where he knew H3045 (8804) that valiant H2428 men H0582 [were].
011:017 And the men H0582 of the city H5892 went out H3318 (8799), and fought H3898 (8735) with Joab H3097: and there fell H5307 (8799) [some] of the people H5971 of the servants H5650 of David H1732; and Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850 died H4191 (8799) also.
011:018 Then Joab H3097 sent H7971 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) David H1732 all the things H1697 concerning the war H4421;
011:019 And charged H6680 (8762) the messenger H4397, saying H0559 (8800), When thou hast made an end H3615 (8763) of telling H1696 (8763) the matters H1697 of the war H4421 unto the king H4428,
011:020 And if so be that the king’s H4428 wrath H2534 arise H5927 (8799), and he say H0559 (8804) unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh H5066 (8738) unto the city H5892 when ye did fight H3898 (8736)? knew H3045 (8804) ye not that they would shoot H3384 (8686) from the wall H2346?
011:021 Who smote H5221 (8689) Abimelech H0040 the son H1121 of Jerubbesheth H3380? did not a woman H0802 cast H7993 (8689) a piece H6400 of a millstone H7393 upon him from the wall H2346, that he died H4191 (8799) in Thebez H8405? why went ye nigh H5066 (8738) the wall H2346? then say H0559 (8804) thou, Thy servant H5650 Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850 is dead H4191 (8804) also.
011:022 So the messenger H4397 went H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) and shewed H5046 (8686) David H1732 all that Joab H3097 had sent H7971 (8804) him for.
011:023 And the messenger H4397 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Surely the men H0582 prevailed H1396 (8804) against us, and came out H3318 (8799) unto us into the field H7704, and we were upon them even unto the entering H6607 of the gate H8179.
011:024 And the shooters H3384 (8688) shot H3384 (8686) from off the wall H2346 upon thy servants H5650; and [some] of the king’s H4428 servants H5650 be dead H4191 (8799), and thy servant H5650 Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850 is dead H4191 (8804) also.
011:025 Then David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the messenger H4397, Thus shalt thou say H0559 (8799) unto Joab H3097, Let not this thing H1697 displease H3415 (8799) H5869 thee, for the sword H2719 devoureth H0398 (8799) one as well as another H2090: make thy battle H4421 more strong H2388 (8685) against the city H5892, and overthrow H2040 (8798) it: and encourage H2388 (8761) thou him.
011:026 And when the wife H0802 of Uriah H0223 heard H8085 (8799) that Uriah H0223 her husband H0376 was dead H4191 (8804), she mourned H5594 (8799) for her husband H1167.
011:027 And when the mourning H0060 was past H5674 (8799), David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) and fetched H0622 (8799) her to his house H1004, and she became his wife H0802, and bare H3205 (8799) him a son H1121. But the thing H1697 that David H1732 had done H6213 (8804) displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 the LORD H3068.
012:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) Nathan H5416 unto David H1732. And he came H0935 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, There were two H8147 men H0582 in one H0259 city H5892; the one H0259 rich H6223, and the other H0259 poor H7326 (8802).
012:002 The rich H6223 [man] had exceeding H3966 many H7235 (8687) flocks H6629 and herds H1241:
012:003 But the poor H7326 (8802) [man] had nothing, save one H0259 little H6996 ewe lamb H3535, which he had bought H7069 (8804) and nourished up H2421 (8762): and it grew up H1431 (8799) together H3162 with him, and with his children H1121; it did eat H0398 (8799) of his own meat H6595, and drank H8354 (8799) of his own cup H3563, and lay H7901 (8799) in his bosom H2436, and was unto him as a daughter H1323.
012:004 And there came H0935 (8799) a traveller H1982 unto the rich H6223 man H0376, and he spared H2550 (8799) to take H3947 (8800) of his own flock H6629 and of his own herd H1241, to dress H6213 (8800) for the wayfaring man H0732 (8802) that was come H0935 (8802) unto him; but took H3947 (8799) the poor H7326 (8802) man’s H0376 lamb H3535, and dressed H6213 (8799) it for the man H0376 that was come H0935 (8802) to him.
012:005 And David’s H1732 anger H0639 was greatly H3966 kindled H2734 (8799) against the man H0376; and he said H0559 (8799) to Nathan H5416, [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, the man H0376 that hath done H6213 (8802) this [thing] shall surely H1121 die H4194:
012:006 And he shall restore H7999 (8762) the lamb H3535 fourfold H0706, because H6118 he did H6213 (8804) this thing H1697, and because H0834 he had no pity H2550 (8804).
012:007 And Nathan H5416 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Thou [art] the man H0376. Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, I anointed H4886 (8804) thee king H4428 over Israel H3478, and I delivered H5337 (8689) thee out of the hand H3027 of Saul H7586;
012:008 And I gave H5414 (8799) thee thy master’s H0113 house H1004, and thy master’s H0113 wives H0802 into thy bosom H2436, and gave H5414 (8799) thee the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and of Judah H3063; and if [that had been] too little H4592, I would moreover have given H3254 (8686) unto thee such H2007 and such things H2007.
012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised H0959 (8804) the commandment H1697 of the LORD H3068, to do H6213 (8800) evil H7451 in his sight H5869? thou hast killed H5221 (8689) Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850 with the sword H2719, and hast taken H3947 (8804) his wife H0802 [to be] thy wife H0802, and hast slain H2026 (8804) him with the sword H2719 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
012:010 Now therefore the sword H2719 shall never H5704 H5769 depart H5493 (8799) from thine house H1004; because H6118 thou hast despised H0959 (8804) me, and hast taken H3947 (8799) the wife H0802 of Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850 to be thy wife H0802.
012:011 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will raise up H6965 (8688) evil H7451 against thee out of thine own house H1004, and I will take H3947 (8804) thy wives H0802 before thine eyes H5869, and give H5414 (8804) [them] unto thy neighbour H7453, and he shall lie H7901 (8804) with thy wives H0802 in the sight H5869 of this sun H8121.
012:012 For thou didst H6213 (8804) [it] secretly H5643: but I will do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697 before all Israel H3478, and before the sun H8121.
012:013 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Nathan H5416, I have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068. And Nathan H5416 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, The LORD H3068 also hath put away H5674 (8689) thy sin H2403; thou shalt not die H4191 (8799).
012:014 Howbeit H0657, because by this deed H1697 thou hast given H5006 great occasion H5006 (8763) to the enemies H0341 (8802) of the LORD H3068 to blaspheme H5006 (8765), the child H1121 also [that is] born H3209 unto thee shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
012:015 And Nathan H5416 departed H3212 (8799) unto his house H1004. And the LORD H3068 struck H5062 (8799) the child H3206 that Uriah’s H0223 wife H0802 bare H3205 (8804) unto David H1732, and it was very sick H0605 (8735).
012:016 David H1732 therefore besought H1245 (8762) God H0430 for the child H5288; and David H1732 fasted H6684 (8799) H6685, and went in H0935 (8804), and lay H7901 (8804) all night H3885 (8804) upon the earth H0776.
012:017 And the elders H2205 of his house H1004 arose H6965 (8799), [and went] to him, to raise him up H6965 (8687) from the earth H0776: but he would H0014 (8804) not, neither did he eat H1262 (8804) bread H3899 with them.
012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh H7637 day H3117, that the child H3206 died H4191 (8799). And the servants H5650 of David H1732 feared H3372 (8799) to tell H5046 (8687) him that the child H3206 was dead H4191 (8804): for they said H0559 (8804), Behold, while the child H3206 was yet alive H2416, we spake H1696 (8765) unto him, and he would not hearken H8085 (8804) unto our voice H6963: how will he then H6213 vex H7451 himself H6213 (8804), if we tell H0559 (8799) him that the child H3206 is dead H4191 (8804)?
012:019 But when David H1732 saw H7200 (8799) that his servants H5650 whispered H3907 (8693), David H1732 perceived H0995 (8799) that the child H3206 was dead H4191 (8804): therefore David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, Is the child H3206 dead H4191 (8804)? And they said H0559 (8799), He is dead H4191 (8804).
012:020 Then David H1732 arose H6965 (8799) from the earth H0776, and washed H7364 (8799), and anointed H5480 (8686) [himself], and changed H2498 (8762) his apparel H8071, and came H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and worshipped H7812 (8691): then he came H0935 (8799) to his own house H1004; and when he required H7592 (8799), they set H7760 (8799) bread H3899 before him, and he did eat H0398 (8799).
012:021 Then said H0559 (8799) his servants H5650 unto him, What thing H1697 [is] this that thou hast done H6213 (8804)? thou didst fast H6684 (8804) and weep H1058 (8799) for the child H3206, [while it was] alive H2416; but when the child H3206 was dead H4191 (8804), thou didst rise H6965 (8804) and eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899.
012:022 And he said H0559 (8799), While the child H3206 was yet alive H2416, I fasted H6684 (8804) and wept H1058 (8799): for I said H0559 (8804), Who can tell H3045 (8802) [whether] GOD H3068 will be gracious H2603 (8804) (8675) H2603 (8762) to me, that the child H3206 may live H2416?
012:023 But now he is dead H4191 (8804), wherefore should I fast H6684 (8802)? can H3201 (8799) I bring him back again H7725 (8687)? I shall go H1980 (8802) to him, but he shall not return H7725 (8799) to me.
012:024 And David H1732 comforted H5162 (8762) Bathsheba H1339 his wife H0802, and went in H0935 (8799) unto her, and lay H7901 (8799) with her: and she bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Solomon H8010: and the LORD H3068 loved H0157 (8804) him.
012:025 And he sent H7971 (8799) by the hand H3027 of Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030; and he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Jedidiah H3041, because of the LORD H3068.
012:026 And Joab H3097 fought H3898 (8735) against Rabbah H7237 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and took H3920 (8799) the royal H4410 city H5892.
012:027 And Joab H3097 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to David H1732, and said H0559 (8799), I have fought H3898 (8738) against Rabbah H7237, and have taken H3920 (8804) the city H5892 of waters H4325.
012:028 Now therefore gather H0622 the rest H3499 of the people H5971 together H0622 (8798), and encamp H2583 (8798) against the city H5892, and take H3920 (8798) it: lest I take H3920 (8799) the city H5892, and it be called H7121 (8738) after my name H8034.
012:029 And David H1732 gathered H0622 all the people H5971 together H0622 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Rabbah H7237, and fought H3898 (8735) against it, and took H3920 (8799) it.
012:030 And he took H3947 (8799) their king’s H4428 crown H5850 from off his head H7218, the weight H4948 whereof [was] a talent H3603 of gold H2091 with the precious H3368 stones H0068: and it was [set] on David’s H1732 head H7218. And he brought forth H3318 (8689) the spoil H7998 of the city H5892 in great H3966 abundance H7235 (8687).
012:031 And he brought forth H3318 (8689) the people H5971 that [were] therein, and put H7760 (8799) [them] under saws H4050, and under harrows H2757 of iron H1270, and under axes H4037 of iron H1270, and made them pass H5674 (8689) through the brickkiln H4404: and thus did H6213 (8799) he unto all the cities H5892 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983. So David H1732 and all the people H5971 returned H7725 (8799) unto Jerusalem H3389.
013:001 ¶ And it came to pass after H0310 this, that Absalom H0053 the son H1121 of David H1732 had a fair H3303 sister H0269, whose name H8034 [was] Tamar H8559; and Amnon H0550 the son H1121 of David H1732 loved H0157 (8799) her.
013:002 And Amnon H0550 was so vexed H3334 (8799), that he fell sick H2470 (8692) for his sister H0269 Tamar H8559; for she [was] a virgin H1330; and Amnon H0550 thought H5869 it hard H6381 (8735) for him to do H6213 (8800) any thing H3972 to her.
013:003 But Amnon H0550 had a friend H7453, whose name H8034 [was] Jonadab H3122, the son H1121 of Shimeah H8093 David’s H1732 brother H0251: and Jonadab H3122 [was] a very H3966 subtil H2450 man H0376.
013:004 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why [art] thou, [being] the king’s H4428 son H1121, lean H1800 from day H1242 to day H1242? wilt thou not tell H5046 (8686) me? And Amnon H0550 said H0559 (8799) unto him, I love H0157 (8802) Tamar H8559, my brother H0251 Absalom’s H0053 sister H0269.
013:005 And Jonadab H3082 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Lay thee down H7901 (8798) on thy bed H4904, and make thyself sick H2470 (8690): and when thy father H0001 cometh H0935 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) thee, say H0559 (8804) unto him, I pray thee, let my sister H0269 Tamar H8559 come H0935 (8799), and give H1262 (8686) me meat H3899, and dress H6213 (8804) the meat H1279 in my sight H5869, that I may see H7200 (8799) [it], and eat H0398 (8804) [it] at her hand H3027.
013:006 So Amnon H0550 lay down H7901 (8799), and made himself sick H2470 (8691): and when the king H4428 was come H0935 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) him, Amnon H0550 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, I pray thee, let Tamar H8559 my sister H0269 come H0935 (8799), and make H3823 (8762) me a couple H8147 of cakes H3834 in my sight H5869, that I may eat H1262 (8799) at her hand H3027.
013:007 Then David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) home H1004 to Tamar H8559, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) now to thy brother H0251 Amnon’s H0550 house H1004, and dress H6213 (8798) him meat H1279.
013:008 So Tamar H8559 went H3212 (8799) to her brother H0251 Amnon’s H0550 house H1004; and he was laid down H7901 (8802). And she took H3947 (8799) flour H1217, and kneaded H3888 (8799) [it], and made cakes H3823 (8762) in his sight H5869, and did bake H1310 (8762) the cakes H3834.
013:009 And she took H3947 (8799) a pan H4958, and poured [them] out H3332 (8799) before H6440 him; but he refused H3985 (8762) to eat H0398 (8800). And Amnon H0550 said H0559 (8799), Have out H3318 (8685) all men H0376 from me. And they went out H3318 (8799) every man H0376 from him.
013:010 And Amnon H0550 said H0559 (8799) unto Tamar H8559, Bring H0935 (8685) the meat H1279 into the chamber H2315, that I may eat H1262 (8799) of thine hand H3027. And Tamar H8559 took H3947 (8799) the cakes H3834 which she had made H6213 (8804), and brought H0935 (8686) [them] into the chamber H2315 to Amnon H0550 her brother H0251.
013:011 And when she had brought H5066 (8686) [them] unto him to eat H0398 (8800), he took hold H2388 (8686) of her, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, Come H0935 (8798) lie H7901 (8798) with me, my sister H0269.
013:012 And she answered H0559 (8799) him, Nay, my brother H0251, do not force H6031 (8762) me; for no such thing ought H3651 to be done H6213 (8735) in Israel H3478: do H6213 (8799) not thou this folly H5039.
013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame H2781 to go H3212 (8686)? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one H0259 of the fools H5036 in Israel H3478. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak H1696 (8761) unto the king H4428; for he will not withhold H4513 (8799) me from thee.
013:014 Howbeit he would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto her voice H6963: but, being stronger H2388 (8799) than she, forced H6031 (8762) her, and lay H7901 (8799) with her.
013:015 Then Amnon H0550 hated H8130 (8799) her exceedingly H3966 H1419; so that the hatred H8135 wherewith he hated H8130 (8804) her [was] greater H1419 than the love H0160 wherewith he had loved H0157 (8804) her. And Amnon H0550 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Arise H6965 (8798), be gone H3212 (8798).
013:016 And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, [There is] no cause H0182: this evil H7451 in sending me away H7971 (8763) [is] greater H1419 than the other H0312 that thou didst H6213 (8804) unto me. But he would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto her.
013:017 Then he called H7121 (8799) his servant H5288 that ministered H8334 (8764) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), Put H7971 (8798) now this [woman] out H2351 from me, and bolt H5274 (8798) the door H1817 after H0310 her.
013:018 And [she had] a garment H3801 of divers colours H6446 upon her: for with such robes H4598 were the king’s H4428 daughters H1323 [that were] virgins H1330 apparelled H3847 (8799). Then his servant H8334 (8764) brought H3318 (8686) her out H2351, and bolted H5274 (8804) the door H1817 after H0310 her.
013:019 And Tamar H8559 put H3947 (8799) ashes H0665 on her head H7218, and rent H7167 (8804) her garment H3801 of divers colours H6446 that [was] on her, and laid H7760 (8799) her hand H3027 on her head H7218, and went H3212 (8799) on H1980 (8800) crying H2199 (8804).
013:020 And Absalom H0053 her brother H0251 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Hath Amnon H0550 thy brother H0251 been with thee? but hold now thy peace H2790 (8685), my sister H0269: he [is] thy brother H0251; regard H7896 (8799) H3820 not this thing H1697. So Tamar H8559 remained H3427 (8799) desolate H8074 (8802) in her brother H0251 Absalom’s H0053 house H1004.
013:021 But when king H4428 David H1732 heard H8085 (8804) of all these things H1697, he was very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799).
013:022 And Absalom H0053 spake H1696 (8765) unto his brother Amnon H0550 neither good H2896 nor bad H7451: for Absalom H0053 hated H8130 (8804) Amnon H0550, because H1697 he had forced H6031 (8765) his sister H0269 Tamar H8559.
013:023 And it came to pass after two full H3117 years H8141, that Absalom H0053 had sheepshearers H1494 (8802) in Baalhazor H1178, which [is] beside Ephraim H0669: and Absalom H0053 invited H7121 (8799) all the king’s H4428 sons H1121.
013:024 And Absalom H0053 came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), Behold now, thy servant H5650 hath sheepshearers H1494 (8802); let H3212 the king H4428, I beseech thee, and his servants H5650 go H3212 (8799) with thy servant H5650.
013:025 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) to Absalom H0053, Nay, my son H1121, let us not all now go H3212 (8799), lest we be chargeable H3513 (8799) unto thee. And he pressed H6555 (8799) him: howbeit he would H0014 (8804) not go H3212 (8800), but blessed H1288 (8762) him.
013:026 Then said H0559 (8799) Absalom H0053, If not, I pray thee, let my brother H0251 Amnon H0550 go H3212 (8799) with us. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why should he go H3212 (8799) with thee?
013:027 But Absalom H0053 pressed H6555 (8799) him, that he let Amnon H0550 and all the king’s H4428 sons H1121 go H7971 (8799) with him.
013:028 Now Absalom H0053 had commanded H6680 (8762) his servants H5288, saying H0559 (8800), Mark H7200 (8798) ye now when Amnon’s H0550 heart H3820 is merry H2896 with wine H3196, and when I say H0559 (8804) unto you, Smite H5221 (8685) Amnon H0550; then kill H4191 (8689) him, fear H3372 (8799) not: have not I commanded H6680 (8765) you? be courageous H2388 (8798), and be valiant H1121 H2428.
013:029 And the servants H5288 of Absalom H0053 did H6213 (8799) unto Amnon H0550 as Absalom H0053 had commanded H6680 (8765). Then all the king’s H4428 sons H1121 arose H6965 (8799), and every man H0376 gat him up H7392 (8799) upon his mule H6505, and fled H5127 (8799).
013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way H1870, that tidings H8052 came H0935 (8804) to David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Absalom H0053 hath slain H5221 (8689) all the king’s H4428 sons H1121, and there is not one H0259 of them left H3498 (8738).
013:031 Then the king H4428 arose H6965 (8799), and tare H7167 (8799) his garments H0899, and lay H7901 (8799) on the earth H0776; and all his servants H5650 stood H5324 (8737) by with their clothes H0899 rent H7167 (8803).
013:032 And Jonadab H3122, the son H1121 of Shimeah H8093 David’s H1732 brother H0251, answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Let not my lord H0113 suppose H0559 (8799) [that] they have slain H4191 (8689) all the young men H5288 the king’s H4428 sons H1121; for Amnon H0550 only is dead H4191 (8804): for by the appointment H6310 of Absalom H0053 this hath been determined H7760 (8803) from the day H3117 that he forced H6031 (8763) his sister H0269 Tamar H8559.
013:033 Now therefore let not my lord H0113 the king H4428 take H7760 (8799) the thing H1697 to his heart H3820, to think H0559 (8800) that all the king’s H4428 sons H1121 are dead H4191 (8804): for Amnon H0550 only is dead H4191 (8804).
013:034 But Absalom H0053 fled H1272 (8799). And the young man H5288 that kept the watch H6822 (8802) lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, there came H1980 (8802) much H7227 people H5971 by the way H1870 of the hill H2022 side H6654 behind H0310 him.
013:035 And Jonadab H3122 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Behold, the king’s H4428 sons H1121 come H0935 (8804): as thy servant H5650 said H1697, so it is.
013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763), that, behold, the king’s H4428 sons H1121 came H0935 (8804), and lifted up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963 and wept H1058 (8799): and the king H4428 also and all his servants H5650 wept H1058 (8804) very H3966 sore H1065 H1419.
013:037 But Absalom H0053 fled H1272 (8804), and went H3212 (8799) to Talmai H8526, the son H1121 of Ammihud H5991 (8675) H5989, king H4428 of Geshur H1650. And [David] mourned H0056 (8691) for his son H1121 every day H3117.
013:038 So Absalom H0053 fled H1272 (8804), and went H3212 (8799) to Geshur H1650, and was there three H7969 years H8141.
013:039 And [the soul of] king H4428 David H1732 longed H3615 (8762) to go forth H3318 (8800) unto Absalom H0053: for he was comforted H5162 (8738) concerning Amnon H0550, seeing he was dead H4191 (8804).
014:001 ¶ Now Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 perceived H3045 (8799) that the king’s H4428 heart H3820 [was] toward Absalom H0053.
014:002 And Joab H3097 sent H7971 (8799) to Tekoah H8620, and fetched H3947 (8799) thence a wise H2450 woman H0802, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner H0056 (8693), and put on H3847 (8798) now mourning H0060 apparel H0899, and anoint H5480 (8799) not thyself with oil H8081, but be as a woman H0802 that had a long H7227 time H3117 mourned H0056 (8690) for the dead H4191 (8801):
014:003 And come H0935 (8804) to the king H4428, and speak H1696 (8765) on this manner H1697 unto him. So Joab H3097 put H7760 (8799) the words H1697 in her mouth H6310.
014:004 And when the woman H0802 of Tekoah H8621 spake H0559 (8799) to the king H4428, she fell H5307 (8799) on her face H0639 to the ground H0776, and did obeisance H7812 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), Help H3467 (8685), O king H4428.
014:005 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered H0559 (8799), I [am] indeed H0061 a widow H0490 woman H0802, and mine husband H0376 is dead H4191 (8799).
014:006 And thy handmaid H8198 had two H8147 sons H1121, and they two H8147 strove together H5327 (8735) in the field H7704, and [there was] none to part H5337 (8688) them, but the one H0259 smote H5221 (8686) the other H0259, and slew H4191 (8686) him.
014:007 And, behold, the whole family H4940 is risen H6965 (8804) against thine handmaid H8198, and they said H0559 (8799), Deliver H5414 (8798) him that smote H5221 (8688) his brother H0251, that we may kill H4191 (8686) him, for the life H5315 of his brother H0251 whom he slew H2026 (8804); and we will destroy H8045 (8686) the heir H3423 (8802) also: and so they shall quench H3518 (8765) my coal H1513 which is left H7760 (8800), and shall not leave H7604 (8738) to my husband H0376 [neither] name H8034 nor remainder H7611 upon H6440 the earth H0127.
014:008 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto the woman H0802, Go H3212 (8798) to thine house H1004, and I will give charge H6680 (8762) concerning thee.
014:009 And the woman H0802 of Tekoah H8621 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, My lord H0113, O king H4428, the iniquity H5771 [be] on me, and on my father’s H0001 house H1004: and the king H4428 and his throne H3678 [be] guiltless H5355.
014:010 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Whosoever saith H1696 (8764) [ought] unto thee, bring H0935 (8689) him to me, and he shall not touch H5060 (8800) thee any more H3254 (8686).
014:011 Then said H0559 (8799) she, I pray thee, let the king H4428 remember H2142 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 to destroy H7843 (8763) any more H7235 (8687), lest they destroy H8045 (8686) my son H1121. And he said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, there shall not one hair H8185 of thy son H1121 fall H5307 (8799) to the earth H0776.
014:012 Then the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799), Let thine handmaid H8198, I pray thee, speak H1696 (8762) [one] word H1697 unto my lord H0113 the king H4428. And he said H0559 (8799), Say on H1696 (8761).
014:013 And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore then hast thou thought H2803 (8804) such a thing against the people H5971 of God H0430? for the king H4428 doth speak H1696 (8693) this thing H1697 as one which is faulty H0818, in that the king H4428 doth not fetch home again H7725 (8687) his banished H5080 (8737).
014:014 For we must needs H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799), and [are] as water H4325 spilt H5064 (8737) on the ground H0776, which cannot be gathered up again H0622 (8735); neither doth God H0430 respect H5375 (8799) [any] person H5315: yet doth he devise H2803 (8804) means H4284, that his banished H5080 (8737) be not expelled H5080 (8799) from him.
014:015 Now therefore that I am come H0935 (8804) to speak H1696 (8763) of this thing H1697 unto my lord H0113 the king H4428, [it is] because the people H5971 have made me afraid H3372 (8765): and thy handmaid H8198 said H0559 (8799), I will now speak H1696 (8762) unto the king H4428; it may be that the king H4428 will perform H6213 (8799) the request H1697 of his handmaid H0519.
014:016 For the king H4428 will hear H8085 (8799), to deliver H5337 (8687) his handmaid H0519 out of the hand H3709 of the man H0376 [that would] destroy H8045 (8687) me and my son H1121 together H3162 out of the inheritance H5159 of God H0430.
014:017 Then thine handmaid H8198 said H0559 (8799), The word H1697 of my lord H0113 the king H4428 shall now be comfortable H4496: for as an angel H4397 of God H0430, so [is] my lord H0113 the king H4428 to discern H8085 (8800) good H2896 and bad H7451: therefore the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will be with thee.
014:018 Then the king H4428 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto the woman H0802, Hide H3582 (8762) not from me, I pray thee, the thing H1697 that I shall ask H7592 (8802) thee. And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799), Let my lord H0113 the king H4428 now speak H1696 (8762).
014:019 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), [Is not] the hand H3027 of Joab H3097 with thee in all this? And the woman H0802 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), [As] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, my lord H0113 the king H4428, none H0376 can H0786 turn to the right hand H3231 (8687) or to the left H8041 (8687) from ought that my lord H0113 the king H4428 hath spoken H1696 (8765): for thy servant H5650 Joab H3097, he bade H6680 (8765) me, and he put H7760 (8804) all these words H1697 in the mouth H6310 of thine handmaid H8198:
014:020 To H5668 fetch about H5437 (8763) this form H6440 of speech H1697 hath thy servant H5650 Joab H3097 done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697: and my lord H0113 [is] wise H2450, according to the wisdom H2451 of an angel H4397 of God H0430, to know H3045 (8800) all [things] that [are] in the earth H0776.
014:021 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Joab H3097, Behold now, I have done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697: go H3212 (8798) therefore, bring H7725 the young man H5288 Absalom H0053 again H7725 (8685).
014:022 And Joab H3097 fell H5307 (8799) to the ground H0776 on his face H6440, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself, and thanked H1288 (8762) the king H4428: and Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799), To day H3117 thy servant H5650 knoweth H3045 (8804) that I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, my lord H0113, O king H4428, in that the king H4428 hath fulfilled H6213 (8804) the request H1697 of his servant H5650.
014:023 So Joab H3097 arose H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799) to Geshur H1650, and brought H0935 (8686) Absalom H0053 to Jerusalem H3389.
014:024 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Let him turn H5437 (8735) to his own house H1004, and let him not see H7200 (8799) my face H6440. So Absalom H0053 returned H5437 (8735) to his own house H1004, and saw H7200 (8804) not the king’s H4428 face H6440.
014:025 But in all Israel H3478 there was none H0376 to be so much H3966 praised H1984 (8763) as Absalom H0053 for his beauty H3303: from the sole H3709 of his foot H7272 even to the crown of his head H6936 there was no blemish H3971 in him.
014:026 And when he polled H1548 (8763) his head H7218, (for it was at every year’s H3117 H3117 end H7093 that he polled H1548 (8762) [it]: because [the hair] was heavy H3513 (8804) on him, therefore he polled H1548 (8765) it:) he weighed H8254 (8804) the hair H8181 of his head H7218 at two hundred H3967 shekels H8255 after the king’s H4428 weight H0068.
014:027 And unto Absalom H0053 there were born H3205 (8735) three H7969 sons H1121, and one H0259 daughter H1323, whose name H8034 [was] Tamar H8559: she was a woman H0802 of a fair H3303 countenance H4758.
014:028 So Absalom H0053 dwelt H3427 (8799) two full H3117 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389, and saw H7200 (8804) not the king’s H4428 face H6440.
014:029 Therefore Absalom H0053 sent H7971 (8799) for Joab H3097, to have sent H7971 (8800) him to the king H4428; but he would H0014 (8804) not come H0935 (8800) to him: and when he sent again H7971 (8799) the second time H8145, he would H0014 (8804) not come H0935 (8800).
014:030 Therefore he said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, See H7200 (8798), Joab’s H3097 field H2513 is near H0413 mine H3027, and he hath barley H8184 there; go H3212 (8798) and set H3341 (8685) it on fire H0784. And Absalom’s H0053 servants H5650 set H3341 (8686) the field H2513 on fire H0784.
014:031 Then Joab H3097 arose H6965 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Absalom H0053 unto [his] house H1004, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherefore have thy servants H5650 set H3341 (8689) my field H2513 on fire H0784?
014:032 And Absalom H0053 answered H0559 (8799) Joab H3097, Behold, I sent H7971 (8804) unto thee, saying H0559 (8800), Come H0935 (8798) hither, that I may send H7971 (8799) thee to the king H4428, to say H0559 (8800), Wherefore am I come H0935 (8804) from Geshur H1650? [it had been] good H2896 for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see H7200 (8799) the king’s H4428 face H6440; and if there be H3426 [any] iniquity H5771 in me, let him kill H4191 (8689) me.
014:033 So Joab H3097 came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, and told H5046 (8686) him: and when he had called H7121 (8799) for Absalom H0053, he came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself on his face H0639 to the ground H0776 before H6440 the king H4428: and the king H4428 kissed H5401 (8799) Absalom H0053.
015:001 ¶ And it came to pass after this H0310, that Absalom H0053 prepared H6213 (8799) him chariots H4818 and horses H5483, and fifty H2572 men H0376 to run H7323 (8801) before H6440 him.
015:002 And Absalom H0053 rose up early H7925 (8689), and stood H5975 (8804) beside H3027 the way H1870 of the gate H8179: and it was [so], that when any man H0376 that had a controversy H7379 came H0935 (8800) to the king H4428 for judgment H4941, then Absalom H0053 called H7121 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), Of what H0335 city H5892 [art] thou? And he said H0559 (8799), Thy servant H5650 [is] of one H0259 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478.
015:003 And Absalom H0053 said H0559 (8799) unto him, See H7200 (8798), thy matters H1697 [are] good H2896 and right H5228; but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king H4428 to hear H8085 (8802) thee.
015:004 Absalom H0053 said H0559 (8799) moreover, Oh that I were made H7760 (8799) judge H8199 (8802) in the land H0776, that every man H0376 which hath any suit H7379 or cause H4941 might come H0935 (8799) unto me, and I would do him justice H6663 (8689)!
015:005 And it was [so], that when any man H0376 came nigh H7126 (8800) [to him] to do him obeisance H7812 (8692), he put forth H7971 (8804) his hand H3027, and took H2388 (8689) him, and kissed H5401 (8804) him.
015:006 And on this manner H1697 did H6213 (8799) Absalom H0053 to all Israel H3478 that came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428 for judgment H4941: so Absalom H0053 stole H1589 (8762) the hearts H3820 of the men H0582 of Israel H3478.
015:007 And it came to pass after H7093 forty H0705 years H8141, that Absalom H0053 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, I pray thee, let me go H3212 (8799) and pay H7999 (8762) my vow H5088, which I have vowed H5087 (8804) unto the LORD H3068, in Hebron H2275.
015:008 For thy servant H5650 vowed H5087 (8804) a vow H5088 while I abode H3427 (8800) at Geshur H1650 in Syria H0758, saying H0559 (8800), If the LORD H3068 shall bring me again H7725 (8799) (8676) H7725 (8686) indeed to Jerusalem H3389, then I will serve H5647 (8804) the LORD H3068.
015:009 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965. So he arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Hebron H2275.
015:010 But Absalom H0053 sent H7971 (8799) spies H7270 (8764) throughout all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), As soon as ye hear H8085 (8800) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, then ye shall say H0559 (8804), Absalom H0053 reigneth H4427 (8804) in Hebron H2275.
015:011 And with Absalom H0053 went H1980 (8804) two hundred H3967 men H0376 out of Jerusalem H3389, [that were] called H7121 (8803); and they went H1980 (8802) in their simplicity H8537, and they knew H3045 (8804) not any thing H1697.
015:012 And Absalom H0053 sent H7971 (8799) for Ahithophel H0302 the Gilonite H1526, David’s H1732 counsellor H3289 (8802), from his city H5892, [even] from Giloh H1542, while he offered H2076 (8800) sacrifices H2077. And the conspiracy H7195 was strong H0533; for the people H5971 increased H7227 continually H1980 (8802) with Absalom H0053.
015:013 And there came H0935 (8799) a messenger H5046 (8688) to David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), The hearts H3820 of the men H0376 of Israel H3478 are after H0310 Absalom H0053.
015:014 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto all his servants H5650 that [were] with him at Jerusalem H3389, Arise H6965 (8798), and let us flee H1272 (8799); for we shall not [else] escape H6413 from H6440 Absalom H0053: make speed H4116 (8761) to depart H3212 (8800), lest he overtake H5381 (8689) us suddenly H4116 (8762), and bring H5080 (8689) evil H7451 upon us, and smite H5221 (8689) the city H5892 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
015:015 And the king’s H4428 servants H5650 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Behold, thy servants H5650 [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord H0113 the king H4428 shall appoint H0977 (8799).
015:016 And the king H4428 went forth H3318 (8799), and all his household H1004 after H7272 him. And the king H4428 left H5800 (8799) ten H6235 women H0802, [which were] concubines H6370, to keep H8104 (8800) the house H1004.
015:017 And the king H4428 went forth H3318 (8799), and all the people H5971 after H7272 him, and tarried H5975 (8799) in a place H1004 that was far off H4801 (8677) H1023.
015:018 And all his servants H5650 passed on H5674 (8802) beside H3027 him; and all the Cherethites H3774, and all the Pelethites H6432, and all the Gittites H1663, six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 which came H0935 (8804) after H7272 him from Gath H1661, passed on H5674 (8802) before H6440 the king H4428.
015:019 Then said H0559 (8799) the king H4428 to Ittai H0863 the Gittite H1663, Wherefore goest H3212 (8799) thou also with us? return H7725 (8798) to thy place H4725, and abide H3427 (8798) with the king H4428: for thou [art] a stranger H5237, and also an exile H1540 (8802).
015:020 Whereas thou camest H0935 (8800) [but] yesterday H8543, should I this day H3117 make thee go H3212 (8800) up and down H5128 (8686) (8675) H5128 (8799) with us? seeing I go H1980 (8802) whither I may, return H7725 (8798) thou, and take back H7725 (8685) thy brethren H0251: mercy H2617 and truth H0571 [be] with thee.
015:021 And Ittai H0863 answered H6030 (8799) the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] my lord H0113 the king H4428 liveth H2416, surely in what place H4725 my lord H0113 the king H4428 shall be, whether in death H4194 or life H2416, even there also will thy servant H5650 be.
015:022 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Ittai H0863, Go H3212 (8798) and pass over H5674 (8798). And Ittai H0863 the Gittite H1663 passed over H5674 (8799), and all his men H0582, and all the little ones H2945 that [were] with him.
015:023 And all the country H0776 wept H1058 (8802) with a loud H1419 voice H6963, and all the people H5971 passed over H5674 (8802): the king H4428 also himself passed over H5674 (8802) the brook H5158 Kidron H6939, and all the people H5971 passed over H5674 (8802), toward H6440 the way H1870 of the wilderness H4057.
015:024 And lo Zadok H6659 also, and all the Levites H3881 [were] with him, bearing H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of God H0430: and they set down H3332 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430; and Abiathar H0054 went up H5927 (8799), until all the people H5971 had done H8552 (8800) passing H5674 (8800) out of the city H5892.
015:025 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Zadok H6659, Carry back H7725 (8685) the ark H0727 of God H0430 into the city H5892: if I shall find H4672 (8799) favour H2580 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068, he will bring me again H7725 (8689), and shew H7200 (8689) me [both] it, and his habitation H5116:
015:026 But if he thus say H0559 (8799), I have no delight H2654 (8804) in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do H6213 (8799) to me as seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto him.
015:027 The king H4428 said H0559 (8799) also unto Zadok H6659 the priest H3548, [Art not] thou a seer H7200 (8802)? return H7725 (8798) into the city H5892 in peace H7965, and your two H8147 sons H1121 with you, Ahimaaz H0290 thy son H1121, and Jonathan H3083 the son H1121 of Abiathar H0054.
015:028 See H7200 (8798), I will tarry H4102 (8700) in the plain H6160 (8675) H5679 of the wilderness H4057, until there come H0935 (8800) word H1697 from you to certify H5046 (8687) me.
015:029 Zadok H6659 therefore and Abiathar H0054 carried H7725 the ark H0727 of God H0430 again H7725 (8686) to Jerusalem H3389: and they tarried H3427 (8799) there.
015:030 And David H1732 went up H5927 (8802) by the ascent H4608 of [mount] Olivet H2132, and wept H1058 (8802) as he went up H5927 (8802), and had his head H7218 covered H2645 (8802), and he went H1980 (8802) barefoot H3182: and all the people H5971 that [was] with him covered H2645 (8804) every man H0376 his head H7218, and they went up H5927 (8804), weeping H1058 (8800) as they went up H5927 (8800).
015:031 And [one] told H5046 (8689) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Ahithophel H0302 [is] among the conspirators H7194 (8802) with Absalom H0053. And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068, I pray thee, turn the counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302 into foolishness H5528 (8761).
015:032 And it came to pass, that [when] David H1732 was come H0935 (8804) to the top H7218 [of the mount], where he worshipped H7812 (8691) God H0430, behold, Hushai H2365 the Archite H0757 came to meet H7125 (8800) him with his coat H3801 rent H7167 (8803), and earth H0127 upon his head H7218:
015:033 Unto whom David H1732 said H0559 (8799), If thou passest on H5674 (8804) with me, then thou shalt be a burden H4853 unto me:
015:034 But if thou return H7725 (8799) to the city H5892, and say H0559 (8804) unto Absalom H0053, I will be thy servant H5650, O king H4428; [as] I [have been] thy father’s H0001 servant H5650 hitherto H0227, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant H5650: then mayest thou for me defeat H6565 (8689) the counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302.
015:035 And [hast thou] not there with thee Zadok H6659 and Abiathar H0054 the priests H3548? therefore it shall be, [that] what thing H1697 soever thou shalt hear H8085 (8799) out of the king’s H4428 house H1004, thou shalt tell H5046 (8686) [it] to Zadok H6659 and Abiathar H0054 the priests H3548.
015:036 Behold, [they have] there with them their two H8147 sons H1121, Ahimaaz H0290 Zadok’s H6659 [son], and Jonathan H3083 Abiathar’s H0054 [son]; and by them H3027 ye shall send H7971 (8804) unto me every thing H1697 that ye can hear H8085 (8799).
015:037 So Hushai H2365 David’s H1732 friend H7463 came H0935 (8799) into the city H5892, and Absalom H0053 came H0935 (8799) into Jerusalem H3389.
016:001 ¶ And when David H1732 was a little H4592 past H5674 (8804) the top H7218 [of the hill], behold, Ziba H6717 the servant H5288 of Mephibosheth H4648 met H7125 (8800) him, with a couple H6776 of asses H2543 saddled H2280 (8803), and upon them two hundred H3967 [loaves] of bread H3899, and an hundred H3967 bunches of raisins H6778, and an hundred H3967 of summer fruits H7019, and a bottle H5035 of wine H3196.
016:002 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Ziba H6717, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba H6717 said H0559 (8799), The asses H2543 [be] for the king’s H4428 household H1004 to ride on H7392 (8800); and the bread H3899 and summer fruit H7019 for the young men H5288 to eat H0398 (8800); and the wine H3196, that such as be faint H3287 in the wilderness H4057 may drink H8354 (8800).
016:003 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), And where [is] thy master’s H0113 son H1121? And Ziba H6717 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Behold, he abideth H3427 (8802) at Jerusalem H3389: for he said H0559 (8804), To day H3117 shall the house H1004 of Israel H3478 restore H7725 (8686) me the kingdom H4468 of my father H0001.
016:004 Then said H0559 (8799) the king H4428 to Ziba H6717, Behold, thine [are] all that [pertained] unto Mephibosheth H4648. And Ziba H6717 said H0559 (8799), I humbly H7812 (8694) beseech thee [that] I may find H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, my lord H0113, O king H4428.
016:005 And when king H4428 David H1732 came H0935 (8804) to Bahurim H0980, behold, thence came out H3318 (8802) a man H0376 of the family H4940 of the house H1004 of Saul H7586, whose name H8034 [was] Shimei H8096, the son H1121 of Gera H1617: he came forth H3318 (8802), and cursed H7043 (8764) still as he came H3318 (8800).
016:006 And he cast H5619 (8762) stones H0068 at David H1732, and at all the servants H5650 of king H4428 David H1732: and all the people H5971 and all the mighty men H1368 [were] on his right hand H3225 and on his left H8040.
016:007 And thus said H0559 (8804) Shimei H8096 when he cursed H7043 (8763), Come out H3318 (8798), come out H3318 (8798), thou bloody H1818 man H0376, and thou man H0376 of Belial H1100:
016:008 The LORD H3068 hath returned H7725 (8689) upon thee all the blood H1818 of the house H1004 of Saul H7586, in whose stead thou hast reigned H4427 (8804); and the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8799) the kingdom H4410 into the hand H3027 of Absalom H0053 thy son H1121: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief H7451, because thou [art] a bloody H1818 man H0376.
016:009 Then said H0559 (8799) Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 unto the king H4428, Why should this dead H4191 (8801) dog H3611 curse H7043 (8762) my lord H0113 the king H4428? let me go over H5674 (8799), I pray thee, and take off H5493 (8686) his head H7218.
016:010 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), What have I to do with you, ye sons H1121 of Zeruiah H6870? so let him curse H7043 (8762), because the LORD H3068 hath said H0559 (8804) unto him, Curse H7043 (8761) David H1732. Who shall then say H0559 (8799), Wherefore hast thou done so H6213 (8804)?
016:011 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abishai H0052, and to all his servants H5650, Behold, my son H1121, which came forth H3318 (8804) of my bowels H4578, seeketh H1245 (8764) my life H5315: how much more now [may this] Benjamite H1145 [do it]? let him alone H3240 (8685), and let him curse H7043 (8762); for the LORD H3068 hath bidden H0559 (8804) him.
016:012 It may be that the LORD H3068 will look H7200 (8799) on mine affliction H5869 (8675) H6040, and that the LORD H3068 will requite H7725 (8689) me good H2896 for his cursing H7045 this day H3117.
016:013 And as David H1732 and his men H0582 went H3212 (8799) by the way H1870, Shimei H8096 went along H1980 (8802) on the hill’s H2022 side H6763 over against H5980 him, and cursed H7043 (8762) as he went H1980 (8800), and threw H5619 (8762) stones H0068 at H5980 him, and cast H6080 (8765) dust H6083.
016:014 And the king H4428, and all the people H5971 that [were] with him, came H0935 (8799) weary H5889, and refreshed H5314 (8735) themselves there.
016:015 And Absalom H0053, and all the people H5971 the men H0376 of Israel H3478, came H0935 (8804) to Jerusalem H3389, and Ahithophel H0302 with him.
016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai H2365 the Archite H0757, David’s H1732 friend H7463, was come H0935 (8804) unto Absalom H0053, that Hushai H2365 said H0559 (8799) unto Absalom H0053, God save H2421 (8799) the king H4428, God save H2421 (8799) the king H4428.
016:017 And Absalom H0053 said H0559 (8799) to Hushai H2365, [Is] this thy kindness H2617 to thy friend H7453? why wentest H1980 (8804) thou not with thy friend H7453?
016:018 And Hushai H2365 said H0559 (8799) unto Absalom H0053, Nay; but whom the LORD H3068, and this people H5971, and all the men H0376 of Israel H3478, choose H0977 (8804), his will I be, and with him will I abide H3427 (8799).
016:019 And again H8145, whom should I serve H5647 (8799)? [should I] not [serve] in the presence H6440 of his son H1121? as I have served H5647 (8804) in thy father’s H0001 presence H6440, so will I be in thy presence H6440.
016:020 Then said H0559 (8799) Absalom H0053 to Ahithophel H0302, Give H3051 (8798) counsel H6098 among you what we shall do H6213 (8799).
016:021 And Ahithophel H0302 said H0559 (8799) unto Absalom H0053, Go in H0935 (8798) unto thy father’s H0001 concubines H6370, which he hath left H3240 (8689) to keep H8104 (8800) the house H1004; and all Israel H3478 shall hear H8085 (8804) that thou art abhorred H0887 (8738) of thy father H0001: then shall the hands H3027 of all that [are] with thee be strong H2388 (8804).
016:022 So they spread H5186 (8686) Absalom H0053 a tent H0168 upon the top of the house H1406; and Absalom H0053 went in H0935 (8799) unto his father’s H0001 concubines H6370 in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478.
016:023 And the counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302, which he counselled H3289 (8804) in those days H3117, [was] as if a man H0376 had enquired H7592 (8799) at the oracle H1697 of God H0430: so [was] all the counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302 both with David H1732 and with Absalom H0053.
017:001 ¶ Moreover Ahithophel H0302 said H0559 (8799) unto Absalom H0053, Let me now choose out H0977 (8799) twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505 men H0376, and I will arise H6965 (8799) and pursue H7291 (8799) after H0310 David H1732 this night H3915:
017:002 And I will come H0935 (8799) upon him while he [is] weary H3023 and weak H7504 handed H3027, and will make him afraid H2729 (8689): and all the people H5971 that [are] with him shall flee H5127 (8804); and I will smite H5221 (8689) the king H4428 only:
017:003 And I will bring back H7725 (8686) all the people H5971 unto thee: the man H0376 whom thou seekest H1245 (8764) [is] as if all returned H7725 (8800): [so] all the people H5971 shall be in peace H7965.
017:004 And the saying H1697 pleased H3474 (8799) Absalom H0053 well H5869, and all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478.
017:005 Then said H0559 (8799) Absalom H0053, Call H7121 (8798) now Hushai H2365 the Archite H0757 also, and let us hear H8085 (8799) likewise what he saith H6310.
017:006 And when Hushai H2365 was come H0935 (8799) to Absalom H0053, Absalom H0053 spake H0559 (8799) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), Ahithophel H0302 hath spoken H1696 (8765) after this manner H1697: shall we do H6213 (8799) [after] his saying H1697? if not; speak H1696 (8761) thou.
017:007 And Hushai H2365 said H0559 (8799) unto Absalom H0053, The counsel H6098 that Ahithophel H0302 hath given H3289 (8804) [is] not good H2896 at this time H6471.
017:008 For, said H0559 (8799) Hushai H2365, thou knowest H3045 (8804) thy father H0001 and his men H0582, that they [be] mighty men H1368, and they [be] chafed H4751 in their minds H5315, as a bear H1677 robbed H7909 of her whelps in the field H7704: and thy father H0001 [is] a man H0376 of war H4421, and will not lodge H3885 (8799) with the people H5971.
017:009 Behold, he is hid H2244 (8737) now in some H0259 pit H6354, or in some H0259 [other] place H4725: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown H5307 (8800) at the first H8462, that whosoever H8085 (8802) heareth H8085 (8804) it will say H0559 (8804), There is a slaughter H4046 among the people H5971 that follow H0310 Absalom H0053.
017:010 And he also [that is] valiant H1121 H2428, whose heart H3820 [is] as the heart H3820 of a lion H0738, shall utterly H4549 (8736) melt H4549 (8735): for all Israel H3478 knoweth H3045 (8802) that thy father H0001 [is] a mighty man H1368, and [they] which [be] with him [are] valiant H2428 men H1121.
017:011 Therefore I counsel H3289 (8804) that all Israel H3478 be generally H0622 (8736) gathered H0622 (8735) unto thee, from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884, as the sand H2344 that [is] by the sea H3220 for multitude H7230; and that thou go H1980 (8802) to battle H7128 in thine own person H6440.
017:012 So shall we come H0935 (8804) upon him in some H0259 place H4725 where he shall be found H4672 (8738), and we will light H5168 upon him as the dew H2919 falleth H5307 (8799) on the ground H0127: and of him and of all the men H0582 that [are] with him there shall not be left H3498 (8738) so much as H1571 one H0259.
017:013 Moreover, if H0518 he be gotten H0622 (8735) into a city H5892, then shall all Israel H3478 bring H5375 (8689) ropes H2256 to that city H5892, and we will draw H5498 (8804) it into the river H5158, until there be not one H1571 small stone H6872 found H4672 (8738) there.
017:014 And Absalom H0053 and all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), The counsel H6098 of Hushai H2365 the Archite H0757 [is] better H2896 than the counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302. For the LORD H3068 had appointed H6680 (8765) to defeat H6565 (8687) the good H2896 counsel H6098 of Ahithophel H0302, to the intent H5668 that the LORD H3068 might bring H0935 (8687) evil H7451 upon Absalom H0053.
017:015 Then said H0559 (8799) Hushai H2365 unto Zadok H6659 and to Abiathar H0054 the priests H3548, Thus and thus did Ahithophel H0302 counsel H3289 (8804) Absalom H0053 and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478; and thus and thus have I counselled H3289 (8804).
017:016 Now therefore send H7971 (8798) quickly H4120, and tell H5046 (8685) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Lodge H3885 (8799) not this night H3915 in the plains H6160 (8675) H5679 of the wilderness H4057, but speedily H5674 (8800) pass over H5674 (8799); lest the king H4428 be swallowed up H1104 (8792), and all the people H5971 that [are] with him.
017:017 Now Jonathan H3083 and Ahimaaz H0290 stayed H5975 (8802) by Enrogel H5883; for they might H3201 (8799) not be seen H7200 (8736) to come H0935 (8800) into the city H5892: and a wench H8198 went H1980 (8804) and told H5046 (8689) them; and they went H3212 (8799) and told H5046 (8689) king H4428 David H1732.
017:018 Nevertheless a lad H5288 saw H7200 (8799) them, and told H5046 (8686) Absalom H0053: but they went H3212 (8799) both H8147 of them away quickly H4120, and came H0935 (8799) to a man’s H0376 house H1004 in Bahurim H0980, which had a well H0875 in his court H2691; whither H8033 they went down H3381 (8799).
017:019 And the woman H0802 took H3947 (8799) and spread H6566 (8799) a covering H4539 over the well’s H0875 mouth H6440, and spread H7849 (8799) ground corn H7383 thereon; and the thing H1697 was not known H3045 (8738).
017:020 And when Absalom’s H0053 servants H5650 came H0935 (8799) to the woman H0802 to the house H1004, they said H0559 (8799), Where [is] Ahimaaz H0290 and Jonathan H3083? And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto them, They be gone over H5674 (8804) the brook H4323 of water H4325. And when they had sought H1245 (8762) and could not find H4672 (8804) [them], they returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
017:021 And it came to pass, after H0310 they were departed H3212 (8800), that they came up H5927 (8799) out of the well H0875, and went H3212 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) king H4428 David H1732, and said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Arise H6965 (8798), and pass quickly H4120 over H5674 (8798) the water H4325: for thus hath Ahithophel H0302 counselled H3289 (8804) against you.
017:022 Then David H1732 arose H6965 (8799), and all the people H5971 that [were] with him, and they passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383: by the morning H1242 light H0216 there lacked H5737 (8738) not one H0259 of them that was not gone over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383.
017:023 And when Ahithophel H0302 saw H7200 (8804) that his counsel H6098 was not followed H6213 (8738), he saddled H2280 (8799) [his] ass H2543, and arose H6965 (8799), and gat him home H3212 (8799) to his house H1004, to his city H5892, and put his household H1004 in order H6680 (8762), and hanged H2614 (8735) himself, and died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in the sepulchre H6913 of his father H0001.
017:024 Then David H1732 came H0935 (8804) to Mahanaim H4266. And Absalom H0053 passed over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383, he and all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 with him.
017:025 And Absalom H0053 made H7760 (8804) Amasa H6021 captain of the host H6635 instead of Joab H3097: which Amasa H6021 [was] a man’s H0376 son H1121, whose name H8034 [was] Ithra H3501 an Israelite H3481, that went in H0935 (8804) to Abigail H0026 the daughter H1323 of Nahash H5176, sister H0269 to Zeruiah H6870 Joab’s H3097 mother H0517.
017:026 So Israel H3478 and Absalom H0053 pitched H2583 (8799) in the land H0776 of Gilead H1568.
017:027 And it came to pass, when David H1732 was come H0935 (8800) to Mahanaim H4266, that Shobi H7629 the son H1121 of Nahash H5176 of Rabbah H7237 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and Machir H4353 the son H1121 of Ammiel H5988 of Lodebar H3810, and Barzillai H1271 the Gileadite H1569 of Rogelim H7274,
017:028 Brought H5066 (8689) beds H4904, and basons H5592, and earthen H3335 (8802) vessels H3627, and wheat H2406, and barley H8184, and flour H7058, and parched H7039 [corn], and beans H6321, and lentiles H5742, and parched H7039 [pulse],
017:029 And honey H1706, and butter H2529, and sheep H6629, and cheese H8194 of kine H1241, for David H1732, and for the people H5971 that [were] with him, to eat H0398 (8800): for they said H0559 (8804), The people H5971 [is] hungry H7457, and weary H5889, and thirsty H6771, in the wilderness H4057.
018:001 ¶ And David H1732 numbered H6485 (8799) the people H5971 that [were] with him, and set H7760 (8799) captains H8269 of thousands H0505 and captains H8269 of hundreds H3967 over them.
018:002 And David H1732 sent forth H7971 (8762) a third part H7992 of the people H5971 under the hand H3027 of Joab H3097, and a third part H7992 under the hand H3027 of Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870, Joab’s H3097 brother H0251, and a third part H7992 under the hand H3027 of Ittai H0863 the Gittite H1663. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, I will surely H3318 (8800) go forth H3318 (8799) with you myself H0589 also.
018:003 But the people H5971 answered H0559 (8799), Thou shalt not go forth H3318 (8799): for if we flee H5127 (8799) away H5127 (8800), they will not care H7760 (8799) H3820 for us; neither if half H2677 of us die H4191 (8799), will they care H7760 (8799) H3820 for us: but now [thou art] worth H3644 ten H6235 thousand H0505 of us: therefore now [it is] better H2896 that thou succour H5826 (8800) (8675) H5826 (8687) us out of the city H5892.
018:004 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto them, What seemeth H5869 you best H3190 (8799) I will do H6213 (8799). And the king H4428 stood H5975 (8799) by the gate H8179 side H3027, and all the people H5971 came out H3318 (8804) by hundreds H3967 and by thousands H0505.
018:005 And the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Joab H3097 and Abishai H0052 and Ittai H0863, saying H0559 (8800), [Deal] gently H0328 for my sake with the young man H5288, [even] with Absalom H0053. And all the people H5971 heard H8085 (8804) when the king H4428 gave all the captains H8269 charge H6680 (8763) concerning H1697 Absalom H0053.
018:006 So the people H5971 went out H3318 (8799) into the field H7704 against H7125 (8800) Israel H3478: and the battle H4421 was in the wood H3293 of Ephraim H0669;
018:007 Where the people H5971 of Israel H3478 were slain H5062 (8735) before H6440 the servants H5650 of David H1732, and there was there a great H1419 slaughter H4046 that day H3117 of twenty H6242 thousand H0505 [men].
018:008 For the battle H4421 was there scattered H6327 (8737) over the face H6440 of all the country H0776: and the wood H3293 devoured H0398 (8800) more H7235 (8686) people H5971 that day H3117 than the sword H2719 devoured H0398 (8804).
018:009 And Absalom H0053 met H7122 (8735) the servants H6440 H5650 of David H1732. And Absalom H0053 rode H7392 (8802) upon a mule H6505, and the mule H6505 went H0935 (8799) under the thick boughs H7730 of a great H1419 oak H0424, and his head H7218 caught hold H2388 (8799) of the oak H0424, and he was taken up H5414 (8714) between the heaven H8064 and the earth H0776; and the mule H6505 that [was] under him went away H5674 (8804).
018:010 And a certain H0259 man H0376 saw H7200 (8799) [it], and told H5046 (8686) Joab H3097, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I saw H7200 (8804) Absalom H0053 hanged H8518 (8803) in an oak H0424.
018:011 And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799) unto the man H0376 that told H5046 (8688) him, And, behold, thou sawest H7200 (8804) [him], and why didst thou not smite H5221 (8689) him there to the ground H0776? and I would have given H5414 (8800) thee ten H6235 [shekels] of silver H3701, and a H0259 girdle H2290.
018:012 And the man H0376 said H0559 (8799) unto Joab H3097, Though H3863 I should receive H8254 (8802) a thousand H0505 [shekels] of silver H3701 in mine hand H3709, [yet] would I not put forth H7971 (8799) mine hand H3027 against the king’s H4428 son H1121: for in our hearing H0241 the king H4428 charged H6680 (8765) thee and Abishai H0052 and Ittai H0863, saying H0559 (8800), Beware H8104 (8798) that none [touch] the young man H5288 Absalom H0053.
018:013 Otherwise H0176 I should have wrought H6213 (8804) falsehood H8267 against mine own life H5315: for there is no matter H1697 hid H3582 (8735) from the king H4428, and thou thyself wouldest have set H3320 (8691) thyself against [me].
018:014 Then said H0559 (8799) Joab H3097, I may not tarry H3176 (8686) thus with thee H6440. And he took H3947 (8799) three H7969 darts H7626 in his hand H3709, and thrust H8628 (8799) them through the heart H3820 of Absalom H0053, while he [was] yet alive H2416 in the midst of the oak H0424.
018:015 And ten H6235 young men H5288 that bare H5375 (8802) Joab’s H3097 armour H3627 compassed about H5437 (8799) and smote H5221 (8686) Absalom H0053, and slew H4191 (8686) him.
018:016 And Joab H3097 blew H8628 (8799) the trumpet H7782, and the people H5971 returned H7725 (8799) from pursuing H7291 (8800) after H0310 Israel H3478: for Joab H3097 held back H2820 (8804) the people H5971.
018:017 And they took H3947 (8799) Absalom H0053, and cast H7993 (8686) him into a great H1419 pit H6354 in the wood H3293, and laid H5324 (8686) a very H3966 great H1419 heap H1530 of stones H0068 upon him: and all Israel H3478 fled H5127 (8804) every one H0376 to his tent H0168.
018:018 Now Absalom H0053 in his lifetime H2416 had taken H3947 (8804) and reared up H5324 (8686) for himself a pillar H4678, which [is] in the king’s H4428 dale H6010: for he said H0559 (8804), I have no son H1121 to keep my name H8034 in remembrance H2142 (8687): and he called H7121 (8799) the pillar H4678 after his own name H8034: and it is called H7121 (8735) unto this day H3117, Absalom’s H0053 place H3027.
018:019 Then said H0559 (8804) Ahimaaz H0290 the son H1121 of Zadok H6659, Let me now run H7323 (8799), and bear H1319 the king H4428 tidings H1319 (8762), how that the LORD H3068 hath avenged H8199 (8804) him of his enemies H3027 H0341 (8802).
018:020 And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou H0376 shalt not bear tidings H1309 this day H3117, but thou shalt bear tidings H1319 (8765) another H0312 day H3117: but this day H3117 thou shalt bear no tidings H1319 (8762), because the king’s H4428 son H1121 is dead H4191 (8804).
018:021 Then said H0559 (8799) Joab H3097 to Cushi H3569, Go H3212 (8798) tell H5046 (8685) the king H4428 what thou hast seen H7200 (8804). And Cushi H3569 bowed H7812 (8691) himself unto Joab H3097, and ran H7323 (8799).
018:022 Then said H0559 (8799) Ahimaaz H0290 the son H1121 of Zadok H6659 yet again H3254 (8686) to Joab H3097, But howsoever H4100, let me, I pray thee, also run H7323 (8799) after H0310 Cushi H3569. And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore wilt thou run H7323 (8801), my son H1121, seeing that thou hast no tidings H1309 ready H4672 (8802)?
018:023 But howsoever, [said he], let me run H7323 (8799). And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Run H7323 (8798). Then Ahimaaz H0290 ran H7323 (8799) by the way H1870 of the plain H3603, and overran H5674 (8799) Cushi H3569.
018:024 And David H1732 sat H3427 (8802) between the two H8147 gates H8179: and the watchman H6822 (8802) went up H3212 (8799) to the roof H1406 over the gate H8179 unto the wall H2346, and lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and looked H7200 (8799), and behold a man H0376 running H7323 (8801) alone.
018:025 And the watchman H6822 (8802) cried H7121 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) the king H4428. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings H1309 in his mouth H6310. And he came H3212 (8799) apace H1980 (8800), and drew near H7131.
018:026 And the watchman H6822 (8802) saw H7200 (8799) another H0312 man H0376 running H7323 (8801): and the watchman H6822 (8802) called H7121 (8799) unto the porter H7778, and said H0559 (8799), Behold [another] man H0376 running H7323 (8801) alone. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), He also bringeth tidings H1319 (8764).
018:027 And the watchman H6822 (8802) said H0559 (8799), Me thinketh H7200 (8802) the running H4794 of the foremost H7223 is like the running H4794 of Ahimaaz H0290 the son H1121 of Zadok H6659. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), He [is] a good H2896 man H0376, and cometh H0935 (8799) with good H2896 tidings H1309.
018:028 And Ahimaaz H0290 called H7121 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, All is well H7965. And he fell down H7812 (8691) to the earth H0776 upon his face H0639 before the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which hath delivered up H5462 (8765) the men H0582 that lifted up H5375 (8804) their hand H3027 against my lord H0113 the king H4428.
018:029 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Is the young man H5288 Absalom H0053 safe H7965? And Ahimaaz H0290 answered H0559 (8799), When Joab H3097 sent H7971 (8800) the king’s H4428 servant H5650, and [me] thy servant H5650, I saw H7200 (8804) a great H1419 tumult H1995, but I knew H3045 (8804) not what [it was].
018:030 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) [unto him], Turn aside H5437 (8798), [and] stand H3320 (8690) here H3541. And he turned aside H5437 (8735), and stood still H5975 (8799).
018:031 And, behold, Cushi H3569 came H0935 (8802); and Cushi H3569 said H0559 (8799), Tidings H1319 (8691), my lord H0113 the king H4428: for the LORD H3068 hath avenged H8199 (8804) thee this day H3117 of all them H3027 that rose up H6965 (8801) against thee.
018:032 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Cushi H3569, Is the young man H5288 Absalom H0053 safe H7965? And Cushi H3569 answered H0559 (8799), The enemies H0341 (8802) of my lord H0113 the king H4428, and all that rise H6965 (8804) against thee to do [thee] hurt H7451, be as [that] young man H5288 [is].
018:033 And the king H4428 was much moved H7264 (8799), and went up H5927 (8799) to the chamber H5944 over the gate H8179, and wept H1058 (8799): and as he went H3212 (8800), thus he said H0559 (8804), O my son H1121 Absalom H0053, my son H1121, my son H1121 Absalom H0053! would God I had died H4191 (8800) for thee H5414 (8799), O Absalom H0053, my son H1121, my son H1121!
019:001 ¶ And it was told H5046 (8714) Joab H3097, Behold, the king H4428 weepeth H1058 (8802) and mourneth H0056 (8691) for Absalom H0053.
019:002 And the victory H8668 that day H3117 was [turned] into mourning H0060 unto all the people H5971: for the people H5971 heard H8085 (8804) say H0559 (8800) that day H3117 how the king H4428 was grieved H6087 (8738) for his son H1121.
019:003 And the people H5971 gat H0935 (8800) them by stealth H1589 (8691) that day H3117 into the city H5892, as people H5971 being ashamed H3637 (8737) steal away H1589 (8691) when they flee H5127 (8800) in battle H4421.
019:004 But the king H4428 covered H3813 (8804) his face H6440, and the king H4428 cried H2199 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963, O my son H1121 Absalom H0053, O Absalom H0053, my son H1121, my son H1121!
019:005 And Joab H3097 came H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 to the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), Thou hast shamed H3001 (8689) this day H3117 the faces H6440 of all thy servants H5650, which this day H3117 have saved H4422 (8764) thy life H5315, and the lives H5315 of thy sons H1121 and of thy daughters H1323, and the lives H5315 of thy wives H0802, and the lives H5315 of thy concubines H6370;
019:006 In that thou lovest H0157 (8800) thine enemies H8130 (8802), and hatest H8130 (8800) thy friends H0157 (8802). For thou hast declared H5046 (8689) this day H3117, that thou regardest neither princes H8269 nor servants H5650: for this day H3117 I perceive H3045 (8804), that if H3863 Absalom H0053 had lived H2416, and all we had died H4191 (8801) this day H3117, then it had pleased thee well H3477 H5869.
019:007 Now therefore arise H6965 (8798), go forth H3318 (8798), and speak H1696 (8761) comfortably H3820 unto thy servants H5650: for I swear H7650 (8738) by the LORD H3068, if thou go not forth H3318 (8802), there will not tarry H3885 (8799) one H0376 with thee this night H3915: and that will be worse H7489 (8804) unto thee than all the evil H7451 that befell H0935 (8804) thee from thy youth H5271 until now.
019:008 Then the king H4428 arose H6965 (8799), and sat H3427 (8799) in the gate H8179. And they told H5046 (8689) unto all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, the king H4428 doth sit H3427 (8802) in the gate H8179. And all the people H5971 came H0935 (8799) before H6440 the king H4428: for Israel H3478 had fled H5127 (8804) every man H0376 to his tent H0168.
019:009 And all the people H5971 were at strife H1777 (8737) throughout all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The king H4428 saved H5337 (8689) us out of the hand H3709 of our enemies H0341 (8802), and he delivered H4422 (8765) us out of the hand H3709 of the Philistines H6430; and now he is fled H1272 (8804) out of the land H0776 for Absalom H0053.
019:010 And Absalom H0053, whom we anointed H4886 (8804) over us, is dead H4191 (8804) in battle H4421. Now therefore why speak H2790 (8688) ye not a word of bringing H7725 the king H4428 back H7725 (8687)?
019:011 And king H4428 David H1732 sent H7971 (8804) to Zadok H6659 and to Abiathar H0054 the priests H3548, saying H0559 (8800), Speak H1696 (8761) unto the elders H2205 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), Why are ye the last H0314 to bring H7725 the king H4428 back H7725 (8687) to his house H1004? seeing the speech H1697 of all Israel H3478 is come H0935 (8804) to the king H4428, [even] to his house H1004.
019:012 Ye [are] my brethren H0251, ye [are] my bones H6106 and my flesh H1320: wherefore then are ye the last H0314 to bring back H7725 (8687) the king H4428?
019:013 And say H0559 (8799) ye to Amasa H6021, [Art] thou not of my bone H6106, and of my flesh H1320? God H0430 do H6213 (8799) so to me, and more H3254 (8686) also, if thou be not captain H8269 of the host H6635 before H6440 me continually H3117 in the room H8478 of Joab H3097.
019:014 And he bowed H5186 (8686) the heart H3824 of all the men H0376 of Judah H3063, even as [the heart of] one H0259 man H0376; so that they sent H7971 (8799) [this word] unto the king H4428, Return H7725 (8798) thou, and all thy servants H5650.
019:015 So the king H4428 returned H7725 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Jordan H3383. And Judah H3063 came H0935 (8804) to Gilgal H1537, to go H3212 (8800) to meet H7125 (8800) the king H4428, to conduct H5674 the king H4428 over H5674 (8687) Jordan H3383.
019:016 And Shimei H8096 the son H1121 of Gera H1617, a Benjamite H1145, which [was] of Bahurim H0980, hasted H4116 (8762) and came down H3381 (8799) with the men H0376 of Judah H3063 to meet H7125 (8800) king H4428 David H1732.
019:017 And [there were] a thousand H0505 men H0376 of Benjamin H1145 with him, and Ziba H6717 the servant H5288 of the house H1004 of Saul H7586, and his fifteen H2568 H6240 sons H1121 and his twenty H6242 servants H5650 with him; and they went over H6743 (8804) Jordan H3383 before H6440 the king H4428.
019:018 And there went over H5674 (8804) a ferry boat H5679 to carry over H5674 (8687) the king’s H4428 household H1004, and to do H6213 (8800) what he thought H5869 good H2896. And Shimei H8096 the son H1121 of Gera H1617 fell down H5307 (8804) before H6440 the king H4428, as he was come over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383;
019:019 And said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Let not my lord H0113 impute H2803 (8799) iniquity H5771 unto me, neither do thou remember H2142 (8799) that which thy servant H5650 did perversely H5753 (8689) the day H3117 that my lord H0113 the king H4428 went out H3318 (8804) of Jerusalem H3389, that the king H4428 should take H7760 (8800) it to his heart H3820.
019:020 For thy servant H5650 doth know H3045 (8804) that I have sinned H2398 (8804): therefore, behold, I am come H0935 (8804) the first H7223 this day H3117 of all the house H1004 of Joseph H3130 to go down H3381 (8800) to meet H7125 (8800) my lord H0113 the king H4428.
019:021 But Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Shall not Shimei H8096 be put to death H4191 (8714) for this, because he cursed H7043 (8765) the LORD’S H3068 anointed H4899?
019:022 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), What have I to do with you, ye sons H1121 of Zeruiah H6870, that ye should this day H3117 be adversaries H7854 unto me? shall there any man H0376 be put to death H4191 (8714) this day H3117 in Israel H3478? for do not I know H3045 (8804) that I [am] this day H3117 king H4428 over Israel H3478?
019:023 Therefore the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Shimei H8096, Thou shalt not die H4191 (8799). And the king H4428 sware H7650 (8735) unto him.
019:024 And Mephibosheth H4648 the son H1121 of Saul H7586 came down H3381 (8804) to meet H7125 (8800) the king H4428, and had neither H3808 dressed H6213 (8804) his feet H7272, nor trimmed H6213 (8804) his beard H8222, nor washed H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, from the day H3117 the king H4428 departed H3212 (8800) until the day H3117 he came H0935 (8804) [again] in peace H7965.
019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come H0935 (8804) to Jerusalem H3389 to meet H7125 (8800) the king H4428, that the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherefore wentest H1980 (8804) not thou with me, Mephibosheth H4648?
019:026 And he answered H0559 (8799), My lord H0113, O king H4428, my servant H5650 deceived H7411 (8765) me: for thy servant H5650 said H0559 (8804), I will saddle H2280 (8799) me an ass H2543, that I may ride H7392 (8799) thereon, and go H3212 (8799) to the king H4428; because thy servant H5650 [is] lame H6455.
019:027 And he hath slandered H7270 (8762) thy servant H5650 unto my lord H0113 the king H4428; but my lord H0113 the king H4428 [is] as an angel H4397 of God H0430: do H6213 (8798) therefore [what is] good H2896 in thine eyes H5869.
019:028 For all [of] my father’s H0001 house H1004 were but H3808 dead H4194 men H0582 before my lord H0113 the king H4428: yet didst thou set H7896 (8799) thy servant H5650 among them that did eat H0398 (8802) at thine own table H7979. What right H6666 therefore have H3426 I yet to cry H2199 (8800) any more unto the king H4428?
019:029 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why speakest H1696 (8762) thou any more of thy matters H1697? I have said H0559 (8804), Thou and Ziba H6717 divide H2505 (8799) the land H7704.
019:030 And Mephibosheth H4648 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Yea, let him take H3947 (8799) all, forasmuch H0310 as H0834 my lord H0113 the king H4428 is come again H0935 (8804) in peace H7965 unto his own house H1004.
019:031 And Barzillai H1271 the Gileadite H1569 came down H3381 (8804) from Rogelim H7274, and went over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383 with the king H4428, to conduct H7971 (8763) him over Jordan H3383.
019:032 Now Barzillai H1271 was a very H3966 aged H2204 (8804) man, [even] fourscore H8084 years H8141 old H1121: and he had provided the king H4428 of sustenance H3557 (8773) while he lay H7871 at Mahanaim H4266; for he [was] a very H3966 great H1419 man H0376.
019:033 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Barzillai H1271, Come thou over H5674 (8798) with me, and I will feed H3557 (8773) thee with me in Jerusalem H3389.
019:034 And Barzillai H1271 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, How long H3117 have I to live H8141 H2416, that I should go up H5927 (8799) with the king H4428 unto Jerusalem H3389?
019:035 I [am] this day H3117 fourscore H8084 years H8141 old H1121: [and] can I discern H3045 (8799) between good H2896 and evil H7451? can thy servant H5650 taste H2938 (8799) what H0834 I eat H0398 (8799) or what H0834 I drink H8354 (8799)? can I hear H8085 (8799) any more the voice H6963 of singing men H7891 (8802) and singing women H7891 (8802)? wherefore then should thy servant H5650 be yet a burden H4853 unto my lord H0113 the king H4428?
019:036 Thy servant H5650 will go H5674 a little way H4592 over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383 with the king H4428: and why should the king H4428 recompense H1580 (8799) it me with such a reward H1578?
019:037 Let thy servant H5650, I pray thee, turn back again H7725 (8799), that I may die H4191 (8799) in mine own city H5892, [and be buried] by the grave H6913 of my father H0001 and of my mother H0517. But behold thy servant H5650 Chimham H3643; let him go over H5674 (8799) with my lord H0113 the king H4428; and do H6213 (8798) to him what shall seem good H2896 H5869 unto thee.
019:038 And the king H4428 answered H0559 (8799), Chimham H3643 shall go H5674 (8799) over with me, and I will do H6213 (8799) to him that which shall seem good H2896 H5869 unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require H0977 (8799) of me, [that] will I do H6213 (8799) for thee.
019:039 And all the people H5971 went over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383. And when the king H4428 was come over H5674 (8804), the king H4428 kissed H5401 (8799) Barzillai H1271, and blessed H1288 (8762) him; and he returned H7725 (8799) unto his own place H4725.
019:040 Then the king H4428 went on H5674 (8799) to Gilgal H1537, and Chimham H3643 went on H5674 (8804) with him: and all the people H5971 of Judah H3063 conducted H5674 (8689) (8675) H5674 (8686) the king H4428, and also half H2677 the people H5971 of Israel H3478.
019:041 And, behold, all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8802) to the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Why have our brethren H0251 the men H0376 of Judah H3063 stolen thee away H1589 (8804), and have brought H5674 (8686) the king H4428, and his household H1004, and all David’s H1732 men H0582 with him, over Jordan H3383?
019:042 And all the men H0376 of Judah H3063 answered H6030 (8799) the men H0376 of Israel H3478, Because the king H4428 [is] near of kin H7138 to us: wherefore then be ye angry H2734 (8804) for this matter H1697? have we eaten H0398 (8804) at all H0398 (8800) of the king’s H4428 [cost]? or hath he given H5375 (8765) us any gift H5379?
019:043 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 answered H6030 (8799) the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and said H0559 (8799), We have ten H6235 parts H3027 in the king H4428, and we H0589 have also more [right] in David H1732 than ye: why then did ye despise H7043 (8689) us, that our advice H1697 should not be first H7223 had in bringing back H7725 (8687) our king H4428? And the words H1697 of the men H0376 of Judah H3063 were fiercer H7185 (8799) than the words H1697 of the men H0376 of Israel H3478.
020:001 ¶ And there happened H7122 (8738) to be there a man H0376 of Belial H1100, whose name H8034 [was] Sheba H7652, the son H1121 of Bichri H1075, a Benjamite H1145: and he blew H8628 (8799) a trumpet H7782, and said H0559 (8799), We have no part H2506 in David H1732, neither have we inheritance H5159 in the son H1121 of Jesse H3448: every H0376 man H0376 to his tents H0168, O Israel H3478.
020:002 So every man H0376 of Israel H3478 went up H5927 (8799) from after H0310 David H1732, [and] followed H0310 Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075: but the men H0376 of Judah H3063 clave H1692 (8804) unto their king H4428, from Jordan H3383 even to Jerusalem H3389.
020:003 And David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to his house H1004 at Jerusalem H3389; and the king H4428 took H3947 (8799) the ten H6235 women H0802 [his] concubines H6370, whom he had left H3240 (8689) to keep H8104 (8800) the house H1004, and put H5414 (8799) them in ward H4931, and fed H3557 (8770) them, but went not in H0935 (8804) unto them. So they were shut up H6887 (8803) unto the day H3117 of their death H4191 (8800), living H2424 in widowhood H0491.
020:004 Then said H0559 (8799) the king H4428 to Amasa H6021, Assemble H2199 (8685) me the men H0376 of Judah H3063 within three H7969 days H3117, and be thou here present H5975 (8798).
020:005 So Amasa H6021 went H3212 (8799) to assemble H2199 (8687) [the men of] Judah H3063: but he tarried longer H0309 (8799) (8675) H3186 (8799) than the set time H4150 which he had appointed H3259 (8804) him.
020:006 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Abishai H0052, Now shall Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075 do us more harm H3415 (8799) than [did] Absalom H0053: take H3947 (8798) thou thy lord’s H0113 servants H5650, and pursue H7291 (8798) after H0310 him, lest he get H4672 (8804) him fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892, and escape H5337 (8689) us H5869.
020:007 And there went out H3318 (8799) after H0310 him Joab’s H3097 men H0582, and the Cherethites H3774, and the Pelethites H6432, and all the mighty men H1368: and they went out H3318 (8799) of Jerusalem H3389, to pursue H7291 (8800) after H0310 Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075.
020:008 When they [were] at the great H1419 stone H0068 which [is] in Gibeon H1391, Amasa H6021 went H0935 (8804) before H6440 them. And Joab’s H3097 garment H4055 that he had put on H3830 was girded H2296 (8803) unto him, and upon it a girdle H2289 [with] a sword H2719 fastened H6775 (8794) upon his loins H4975 in the sheath H8593 thereof; and as he went forth H3318 (8804) it fell out H5307 (8799).
020:009 And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799) to Amasa H6021, [Art] thou in health H7965, my brother H0251? And Joab H3097 took H0270 (8799) Amasa H6021 by the beard H2206 with the right H3225 hand H3027 to kiss H5401 (8800) him.
020:010 But Amasa H6021 took no heed H8104 (8738) to the sword H2719 that [was] in Joab’s H3097 hand H3027: so he smote H5221 (8686) him therewith in the fifth H2570 [rib], and shed out H8210 (8799) his bowels H4578 to the ground H0776, and struck him not again H8138 (8804); and he died H4191 (8799). So Joab H3097 and Abishai H0052 his brother H0251 pursued H7291 (8804) after H0310 Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075.
020:011 And one H0376 of Joab’s H3097 men H5288 stood H5975 (8804) by him, and said H0559 (8799), He H4310 that favoureth H2654 (8804) Joab H3097, and he that [is] for David H1732, [let him go] after H0310 Joab H3097.
020:012 And Amasa H6021 wallowed H1556 (8706) in blood H1818 in the midst H8432 of the highway H4546. And when the man H0376 saw H7200 (8799) that all the people H5971 stood still H5975 (8804), he removed H5437 (8686) Amasa H6021 out of the highway H4546 into the field H7704, and cast H7993 (8686) a cloth H0899 upon him, when he saw H7200 (8804) that every one that came H0935 (8802) by him stood still H5975 (8804).
020:013 When he was removed H3014 (8689) out of the highway H4546, all the people H0376 went on H5674 (8804) after H0310 Joab H3097, to pursue H7291 (8800) after H0310 Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075.
020:014 And he went H5674 (8799) through all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 unto Abel H0059, and to Bethmaachah H1038, and all the Berites H1276: and they were gathered together H6950 (8735) (8675) H7035 (8735), and went H0935 (8799) also after H0310 him.
020:015 And they came H0935 (8799) and besieged H6696 (8799) him in Abel H0059 of Bethmaachah H1038, and they cast up H8210 (8799) a bank H5550 against the city H5892, and it stood H5975 (8799) in the trench H2426: and all the people H5971 that [were] with Joab H3097 battered H7843 (8688) the wall H2346, to throw it down H5307 (8687).
020:016 Then cried H7121 (8799) a wise H2450 woman H0802 out of the city H5892, Hear H8085 (8798), hear H8085 (8798); say H0559 (8798), I pray you, unto Joab H3097, Come near H7126 (8798) hither, that I may speak H1696 (8762) with thee.
020:017 And when he was come near H7126 (8799) unto her, the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799), [Art] thou Joab H3097? And he answered H0559 (8799), I [am he]. Then she said H0559 (8799) unto him, Hear H8085 (8798) the words H1697 of thine handmaid H0519. And he answered H0559 (8799), I do hear H8085 (8802).
020:018 Then she spake H0559 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), They were wont H1696 (8763) to speak H1696 (8762) in old time H7223, saying H0559 (8800), They shall surely H7592 (8800) ask H7592 (8762) [counsel] at Abel H0059: and so they ended H8552 (8689) [the matter].
020:019 I [am one of them that are] peaceable H7999 (8803) [and] faithful H0539 (8803) in Israel H3478: thou seekest H1245 (8764) to destroy H4191 (8687) a city H5892 and a mother H0517 in Israel H3478: why wilt thou swallow up H1104 (8762) the inheritance H5159 of the LORD H3068?
020:020 And Joab H3097 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Far be it H2486, far be it H2486 from me, that I should swallow up H1104 (8762) or destroy H7843 (8686).
020:021 The matter H1697 [is] not so: but a man H0376 of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075 by name H8034, hath lifted up H5375 (8804) his hand H3027 against the king H4428, [even] against David H1732: deliver H5414 (8798) him only, and I will depart H3212 (8799) from the city H5892. And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto Joab H3097, Behold, his head H7218 shall be thrown H7993 (8716) to thee over H1157 the wall H2346.
020:022 Then the woman H0802 went H0935 (8799) unto all the people H5971 in her wisdom H2451. And they cut off H3772 (8799) the head H7218 of Sheba H7652 the son H1121 of Bichri H1075, and cast H7993 (8686) [it] out to Joab H3097. And he blew H8628 (8799) a trumpet H7782, and they retired H6327 (8799) from the city H5892, every man H0376 to his tent H0168. And Joab H3097 returned H7725 (8804) to Jerusalem H3389 unto the king H4428.
020:023 Now Joab H3097 [was] over all the host H6635 of Israel H3478: and Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077 [was] over the Cherethites H3774 (8675) H3746 and over the Pelethites H6432:
020:024 And Adoram H0151 [was] over the tribute H4522: and Jehoshaphat H3092 the son H1121 of Ahilud H0286 [was] recorder H2142 (8688):
020:025 And Sheva H7864 (8675) H7724 [was] scribe H5608 (8802): and Zadok H6659 and Abiathar H0054 [were] the priests H3548:
020:026 And Ira H5896 also the Jairite H2972 was a chief ruler H3548 about David H1732.
021:001 ¶ Then there was a famine H7458 in the days H3117 of David H1732 three H7969 years H8141, year H8141 after H0310 year H8141; and David H1732 enquired H1245 (8762) of H6440 the LORD H3068. And the LORD H3068 answered H0559 (8799), [It is] for Saul H7586, and for [his] bloody H1818 house H1004, because he slew H4191 (8689) the Gibeonites H1393.
021:002 And the king H4428 called H7121 (8799) the Gibeonites H1393, and said H0559 (8799) unto them; (now the Gibeonites H1393 [were] not of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, but of the remnant H3499 of the Amorites H0567; and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 had sworn H7650 (8738) unto them: and Saul H7586 sought H1245 (8762) to slay H5221 (8687) them in his zeal H7065 (8763) to the children H1121 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063.)
021:003 Wherefore David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the Gibeonites H1393, What shall I do H6213 (8799) for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement H3722 (8762), that ye may bless H1288 (8761) the inheritance H5159 of the LORD H3068?
021:004 And the Gibeonites H1393 said H0559 (8799) unto him, We will have no silver H3701 nor gold H2091 of H5973 Saul H7586, nor of his house H1004; neither for us shalt thou kill H4191 (8687) any man H0376 in Israel H3478. And he said H0559 (8799), What ye shall say H0559 (8802), [that] will I do H6213 (8799) for you.
021:005 And they answered H0559 (8799) the king H4428, The man H0376 that consumed H3615 (8765) us, and that devised H1819 (8765) against us [that] we should be destroyed H8045 (8738) from remaining H3320 (8692) in any of the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478,
021:006 Let seven H7651 men H0582 of his sons H1121 be delivered H5414 (8714) unto us, and we will hang them up H3363 (8689) unto the LORD H3068 in Gibeah H1390 of Saul H7586, [whom] the LORD H3068 did choose H0972. And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), I will give H5414 (8799) [them].
021:007 But the king H4428 spared H2550 (8799) Mephibosheth H4648, the son H1121 of Jonathan H3083 the son H1121 of Saul H7586, because of the LORD’S H3068 oath H7621 that [was] between them, between David H1732 and Jonathan H3083 the son H1121 of Saul H7586.
021:008 But the king H4428 took H3947 (8799) the two H8147 sons H1121 of Rizpah H7532 the daughter H1323 of Aiah H0345, whom she bare H3205 (8804) unto Saul H7586, Armoni H0764 and Mephibosheth H4648; and the five H2568 sons H1121 of Michal H4324 the daughter H1323 of Saul H7586, whom she brought up H3205 (8804) for Adriel H5741 the son H1121 of Barzillai H1271 the Meholathite H4259:
021:009 And he delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hands H3027 of the Gibeonites H1393, and they hanged H3363 (8686) them in the hill H2022 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and they fell H5307 (8799) [all] seven H7651 (8675) H7659 together H3162, and were put to death H4191 (8717) in the days H3117 of harvest H7105, in the first H7223 [days], in the beginning H8462 of barley H8184 harvest H7105.
021:010 And Rizpah H7532 the daughter H1323 of Aiah H0345 took H3947 (8799) sackcloth H8242, and spread H5186 (8686) it for her upon the rock H6697, from the beginning H8462 of harvest H7105 until water H4325 dropped H5413 (8738) upon them out of heaven H8064, and suffered H5414 (8804) neither the birds H5775 of the air H8064 to rest H5117 (8800) on them by day H3119, nor the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 by night H3915.
021:011 And it was told H5046 (8714) David H1732 what Rizpah H7532 the daughter H1323 of Aiah H0345, the concubine H6370 of Saul H7586, had done H6213 (8804).
021:012 And David H1732 went H3212 (8799) and took H3947 (8799) the bones H6106 of Saul H7586 and the bones H6106 of Jonathan H3083 his son H1121 from the men H1167 of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568, which had stolen H1589 (8804) them from the street H7339 of Bethshan H1052, where the Philistines H6430 had hanged H8511 (8804) (8675) H8518 (8804) them, when H3117 the Philistines H6430 had slain H5221 (8687) Saul H7586 in Gilboa H1533:
021:013 And he brought up H5927 (8686) from thence the bones H6106 of Saul H7586 and the bones H6106 of Jonathan H3083 his son H1121; and they gathered H0622 (8799) the bones H6106 of them that were hanged H3363 (8716).
021:014 And the bones H6106 of Saul H7586 and Jonathan H3083 his son H1121 buried H6912 (8799) they in the country H0776 of Benjamin H1144 in Zelah H6762, in the sepulchre H6913 of Kish H7027 his father H0001: and they performed H6213 (8799) all that the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8765). And after H0310 that God H0430 was intreated H6279 (8735) for the land H0776.
021:015 Moreover the Philistines H6430 had yet war H4421 again with Israel H3478; and David H1732 went down H3381 (8799), and his servants H5650 with him, and fought H3898 (8735) against the Philistines H6430: and David H1732 waxed faint H5774 (8799).
021:016 And Ishbibenob H3430, which [was] of the sons H3211 of the giant H7497, the weight H4948 of whose spear H7013 [weighed] three H7969 hundred H3967 [shekels] of brass H5178 in weight H4948, he being girded H2296 (8803) with a new H2319 [sword], thought H0559 (8799) to have slain H5221 (8687) David H1732.
021:017 But Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 succoured H5826 (8799) him, and smote H5221 (8686) the Philistine H6430, and killed H4191 (8686) him. Then the men H0582 of David H1732 sware H7650 (8738) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt go H3318 (8799) no more out with us to battle H4421, that thou quench H3518 (8762) not the light H5216 of Israel H3478.
021:018 And it came to pass after this H0310, that there was again a battle H4421 with the Philistines H6430 at Gob H1359: then Sibbechai H5444 the Hushathite H2843 slew H5221 (8689) Saph H5593, which [was] of the sons H3211 of the giant H7497.
021:019 And there was again a battle H4421 in Gob H1359 with the Philistines H6430, where Elhanan H0445 the son H1121 of Jaareoregim H3296, a Bethlehemite H1022, slew H5221 (8686) [the brother of] Goliath H1555 the Gittite H1663, the staff H6086 of whose spear H2595 [was] like a weaver’s H0707 (8802) beam H4500.
021:020 And there was yet a battle H4421 in Gath H1661, where was a man H0376 of [great] stature H4067 (8675) H4055, that had on every hand H3027 six H8337 fingers H0676, and on every foot H7272 six H8337 toes H0676, four H0702 and twenty H6242 in number H4557; and he also was born H3205 (8795) to the giant H7497.
021:021 And when he defied H2778 (8762) Israel H3478, Jonathan H3083 the son H1121 of Shimea H8092 the brother H0251 of David H1732 slew H5221 (8686) him.
021:022 These four H0702 were born H3205 (8795) to the giant H7497 in Gath H1661, and fell H5307 (8799) by the hand H3027 of David H1732, and by the hand H3027 of his servants H5650.
022:001 ¶ And David H1732 spake H1696 (8762) unto the LORD H3068 the words H1697 of this song H7892 in the day H3117 [that] the LORD H3068 had delivered H5337 (8689) him out of the hand H3709 of all his enemies H0341 (8802), and out of the hand H3709 of Saul H7586:
022:002 And he said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 [is] my rock H5553, and my fortress H4686, and my deliverer H6403 (8764);
022:003 The God H0430 of my rock H6697; in him will I trust H2620 (8799): [he is] my shield H4043, and the horn H7161 of my salvation H3468, my high tower H4869, and my refuge H4498, my saviour H3467 (8688); thou savest H3467 (8686) me from violence H2555.
022:004 I will call H7121 (8799) on the LORD H3068, [who is] worthy to be praised H1984 (8794): so shall I be saved H3467 (8735) from mine enemies H0341 (8802).
022:005 When the waves H4867 of death H4194 compassed H0661 (8804) me, the floods H5158 of ungodly men H1100 made me afraid H1204 (8762);
022:006 The sorrows H2256 of hell H7585 compassed me about H5437 (8804); the snares H4170 of death H4194 prevented H6923 (8765) me;
022:007 In my distress H6862 I called H7121 (8799) upon the LORD H3068, and cried H7121 (8799) to my God H0430: and he did hear H8085 (8799) my voice H6963 out of his temple H1964, and my cry H7775 [did enter] into his ears H0241.
022:008 Then the earth H0776 shook H1607 (8691) (8675) H1607 (8799) and trembled H7493 (8799); the foundations H4146 of heaven H8064 moved H7264 (8799) and shook H1607 (8691), because he was wroth H2734 (8804).
022:009 There went up H5927 (8804) a smoke H6227 out of his nostrils H0639, and fire H0784 out of his mouth H6310 devoured H0398 (8799): coals H1513 were kindled H1197 (8804) by it.
022:010 He bowed H5186 (8799) the heavens H8064 also, and came down H3381 (8799); and darkness H6205 [was] under his feet H7272.
022:011 And he rode H7392 (8799) upon a cherub H3742, and did fly H5774 (8799): and he was seen H7200 (8735) upon the wings H3671 of the wind H7307.
022:012 And he made H7896 (8799) darkness H2822 pavilions H5521 round about H5439 him, dark H2841 waters H4325, [and] thick clouds H5645 of the skies H7834.
022:013 Through the brightness H5051 before him were coals H1513 of fire H0784 kindled H1197 (8804).
022:014 The LORD H3068 thundered H7481 (8686) from heaven H8064, and the most High H5945 uttered H5414 (8799) his voice H6963.
022:015 And he sent out H7971 (8799) arrows H2671, and scattered H6327 (8686) them; lightning H1300, and discomfited H2000 (8799) them.
022:016 And the channels H0650 of the sea H3220 appeared H7200 (8735), the foundations H4146 of the world H8398 were discovered H1540 (8735), at the rebuking H1606 of the LORD H3068, at the blast H5397 of the breath H7307 of his nostrils H0639.
022:017 He sent H7971 (8799) from above H4791, he took H3947 (8799) me; he drew H4871 (8686) me out of many H7227 waters H4325;
022:018 He delivered H5337 (8686) me from my strong H5794 enemy H0341 (8802), [and] from them that hated H8130 (8802) me: for they were too strong H0553 (8804) for me.
022:019 They prevented H6923 (8762) me in the day H3117 of my calamity H0343: but the LORD H3068 was my stay H4937.
022:020 He brought me forth H3318 (8686) also into a large place H4800: he delivered H2502 (8762) me, because he delighted H2654 (8804) in me.
022:021 The LORD H3068 rewarded H1580 (8799) me according to my righteousness H6666: according to the cleanness H1252 of my hands H3027 hath he recompensed H7725 (8686) me.
022:022 For I have kept H8104 (8804) the ways H1870 of the LORD H3068, and have not wickedly departed H7561 (8804) from my God H0430.
022:023 For all his judgments H4941 [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes H2708, I did not depart H5493 (8799) from them.
022:024 I was also upright H8549 before him, and have kept H8104 (8691) myself from mine iniquity H5771.
022:025 Therefore the LORD H3068 hath recompensed H7725 (8686) me according to my righteousness H6666; according to my cleanness H1252 in his eye sight H5048 H5869.
022:026 With the merciful H2623 thou wilt shew thyself merciful H2616 (8691), [and] with the upright H8549 man H1368 thou wilt shew thyself upright H8552 (8691).
022:027 With the pure H1305 (8737) thou wilt shew thyself pure H1305 (8691); and with the froward H6141 thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury H6617 (8691).
022:028 And the afflicted H6041 people H5971 thou wilt save H3467 (8686): but thine eyes H5869 [are] upon the haughty H7311 (8802), [that] thou mayest bring [them] down H8213 (8686).
022:029 For thou [art] my lamp H5216, O LORD H3068: and the LORD H3068 will lighten H5050 (8686) my darkness H2822.
022:030 For by thee I have run H7323 (8799) through a troop H1416: by my God H0430 have I leaped over H1801 (8762) a wall H7791.
022:031 [As for] God H0410, his way H1870 [is] perfect H8549; the word H0565 of the LORD H3068 [is] tried H6884 (8803): he [is] a buckler H4043 to all them that trust H2620 (8802) in him.
022:032 For who [is] God H0410, save H1107 the LORD H3068? and who [is] a rock H6697, save H1107 our God H0430?
022:033 God H0410 [is] my strength H4581 [and] power H2428: and he maketh H5425 (8686) my way H1870 perfect H8549.
022:034 He maketh H7737 my feet H7272 like H7737 (8764) hinds H0355 ’ [feet]: and setteth H5975 (8686) me upon my high places H1116.
022:035 He teacheth H3925 (8764) my hands H3027 to war H4421; so that a bow H7198 of steel H5154 is broken H5181 (8765) by mine arms H2220.
022:036 Thou hast also given H5414 (8799) me the shield H4043 of thy salvation H3468: and thy gentleness H6031 (8800) (8676) H6038 hath made me great H7235 (8686).
022:037 Thou hast enlarged H7337 (8686) my steps H6806 under me; so that my feet H7166 did not slip H4571 (8804).
022:038 I have pursued H7291 (8799) mine enemies H0341 (8802), and destroyed H8045 (8686) them; and turned not again H7725 (8799) until I had consumed H3615 (8763) them.
022:039 And I have consumed H3615 (8762) them, and wounded H4272 (8799) them, that they could not arise H6965 (8799): yea, they are fallen H5307 (8799) under my feet H7272.
022:040 For thou hast girded H0247 (8762) me with strength H2428 to battle H4421: them that rose up H6965 (8801) against me hast thou subdued H3766 (8686) under me.
022:041 Thou hast also given H5414 (8804) me the necks H6203 of mine enemies H0341 (8802), that I might destroy H6789 (8686) them that hate H8130 (8764) me.
022:042 They looked H8159 (8799), but [there was] none to save H3467 (8688); [even] unto the LORD H3068, but he answered H6030 (8804) them not.
022:043 Then did I beat H7833 (8799) them as small as the dust H6083 of the earth H0776, I did stamp H1854 (8686) them as the mire H2916 of the street H2351, [and] did spread them abroad H7554 (8799).
022:044 Thou also hast delivered H6403 (8762) me from the strivings H7379 of my people H5971, thou hast kept H8104 (8799) me [to be] head H7218 of the heathen H1471: a people H5971 [which] I knew H3045 (8804) not shall serve H5647 (8799) me.
022:045 Strangers H1121 H5236 shall submit H3584 (8691) themselves unto me: as soon as they hear H8085 (8800) H0241, they shall be obedient H8085 (8735) unto me.
022:046 Strangers H1121 H5236 shall fade away H5034 (8799), and they shall be afraid H2296 (8799) out of their close places H4526.
022:047 The LORD H3068 liveth H2416; and blessed H1288 (8803) [be] my rock H6697; and exalted H7311 (8799) be the God H0430 of the rock H6697 of my salvation H3468.
022:048 It [is] God H0410 that avengeth H5414 (8802) H5360 me, and that bringeth down H3381 (8688) the people H5971 under me,
022:049 And that bringeth me forth H3318 (8688) from mine enemies H0341 (8802): thou also hast lifted me up on high H7311 (8787) above them that rose up H6965 (8801) against me: thou hast delivered H5337 (8686) me from the violent H2555 man H0376.
022:050 Therefore I will give thanks H3034 (8686) unto thee, O LORD H3068, among the heathen H1471, and I will sing praises H2167 (8762) unto thy name H8034.
022:051 [He is] the tower H4024 (8675) H1431 (8688) of salvation H3444 for his king H4428: and sheweth H6213 (8802) mercy H2617 to his anointed H4899, unto David H1732, and to his seed H2233 for H5704 evermore H5769.
023:001 ¶ Now these [be] the last H0314 words H1697 of David H1732. David H1732 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 said H5002 (8803), and the man H1397 [who was] raised up H6965 (8717) on high H5920, the anointed H4899 of the God H0430 of Jacob H3290, and the sweet H5273 psalmist H2158 of Israel H3478, said H5002 (8803),
023:002 The Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) by me, and his word H4405 [was] in my tongue H3956.
023:003 The God H0430 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8804), the Rock H6697 of Israel H3478 spake H1696 (8765) to me, He that ruleth H4910 (8802) over men H0120 [must be] just H6662, ruling H4910 (8802) in the fear H3374 of God H0430.
023:004 And [he shall be] as the light H0216 of the morning H1242, [when] the sun H8121 riseth H2224 (8799), [even] a morning H1242 without H3808 clouds H5645; [as] the tender grass H1877 [springing] out of the earth H0776 by clear shining H5051 after rain H4306.
023:005 Although my house H1004 [be] not so with God H0410; yet he hath made H7760 (8804) with me an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285, ordered H6186 (8803) in all [things], and sure H8104 (8803): for [this is] all my salvation H3468, and all [my] desire H2656, although he make [it] not to grow H6779 (8686).
023:006 But [the sons] of Belial H1100 [shall be] all of them as thorns H6975 thrust away H5074 (8716), because they cannot be taken H3947 (8799) with hands H3027:
023:007 But the man H0376 [that] shall touch H5060 (8799) them must be fenced H4390 (8735) with iron H1270 and the staff H6086 of a spear H2595; and they shall be utterly H8313 (8800) burned H8313 (8735) with fire H0784 in the [same] place H7675 (8800).
023:008 These [be] the names H8034 of the mighty men H1368 whom David H1732 had: The Tachmonite H8461 that sat H3427 (8802) in the seat H7675 (8800) (8677) H3429, chief H7218 among the captains H7991; the same [was] Adino H5722 the Eznite H6112: [he lift up his spear] against eight H8083 hundred H3967, whom he slew H2491 at one H0259 time H6471.
023:009 And after H0310 him [was] Eleazar H0499 the son H1121 of Dodo H1734 the Ahohite H0266, [one] of the three H7969 mighty men H1368 with David H1732, when they defied H2778 (8763) the Philistines H6430 [that] were there gathered together H0622 (8738) to battle H4421, and the men H0376 of Israel H3478 were gone away H5927 (8799):
023:010 He arose H6965 (8804), and smote H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430 until H3588 his hand H3027 was weary H3021 (8804), and his hand H3027 clave H1692 (8799) unto the sword H2719: and the LORD H3068 wrought H6213 (8799) a great H1419 victory H8668 that day H3117; and the people H5971 returned H7725 (8799) after H0310 him only to spoil H6584 (8763).
023:011 And after H0310 him [was] Shammah H8048 the son H1121 of Agee H0089 the Hararite H2043. And the Philistines H6430 were gathered together H0622 (8735) into a troop H2416, where was a piece H2513 of ground H7704 full H4392 of lentiles H5742: and the people H5971 fled H5127 (8804) from H6440 the Philistines H6430.
023:012 But he stood H3320 (8691) in the midst H8432 of the ground H2513, and defended H5337 (8686) it, and slew H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430: and the LORD H3068 wrought H6213 (8799) a great H1419 victory H8668.
023:013 And three H7969 (8675) H7970 of the thirty H7970 chief H7218 went down H3381 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to David H1732 in the harvest time H7105 unto the cave H4631 of Adullam H5725: and the troop H2416 of the Philistines H6430 pitched H2583 (8802) in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
023:014 And David H1732 [was] then in an hold H4686, and the garrison H4673 of the Philistines H6430 [was] then [in] Bethlehem H1035.
023:015 And David H1732 longed H0183 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), Oh that one would give me drink H8248 (8686) of the water H4325 of the well H0953 of Bethlehem H1035, which [is] by the gate H8179!
023:016 And the three H7969 mighty men H1368 brake through H1234 (8799) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430, and drew H7579 (8799) water H4325 out of the well H0953 of Bethlehem H1035, that [was] by the gate H8179, and took H5375 (8799) [it], and brought H0935 (8686) [it] to David H1732: nevertheless he would H0014 (8804) not drink H8354 (8800) thereof, but poured it out H5258 (8686) unto the LORD H3068.
023:017 And he said H0559 (8799), Be it far H2486 from me, O LORD H3068, that I should do H6213 (8800) this: [is not this] the blood H1818 of the men H0582 that went H1980 (8802) in jeopardy of their lives H5315? therefore he would H0014 (8804) not drink H8354 (8800) it. These things did H6213 (8804) these three H7969 mighty men H1368.
023:018 And Abishai H0052, the brother H0251 of Joab H3097, the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870, was chief H7218 among three H7992. And he lifted up H5782 (8790) his spear H2595 against three H7969 hundred H3967, [and] slew H2491 [them], and had the name H8034 among three H7969.
023:019 Was he not most honourable H3513 (8737) of three H7969? therefore he was their captain H8269: howbeit he attained H0935 (8804) not unto the [first] three H7969.
023:020 And Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077, the son H1121 of a valiant H2428 man H0376 (8677) H0381, of Kabzeel H6909, who had done many H7227 acts H6467, he slew H5221 (8689) two H8147 lionlike men H0739 of Moab H4124: he went down H3381 (8804) also and slew H5221 (8689) a lion H0738 in the midst H8432 of a pit H0953 in time H3117 of snow H7950:
023:021 And he slew H2026 (8799) an Egyptian H4713, a goodly H4758 man H0376: and the Egyptian H4713 had a spear H2595 in his hand H3027; but he went down H3381 (8799) to him with a staff H7626, and plucked H1497 (8799) the spear H2595 out of the Egyptian’s H4713 hand H3027, and slew H5221 (8689) him with his own spear H2595.
023:022 These [things] did H6213 (8804) Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077, and had the name H8034 among three H7969 mighty men H1368.
023:023 He was more honourable H3513 (8737) than the thirty H7970, but he attained H0935 (8804) not to the [first] three H7969. And David H1732 set H7760 (8799) him over his guard H4928.
023:024 Asahel H6214 the brother H0251 of Joab H3097 [was] one of the thirty H7970; Elhanan H0445 the son H1121 of Dodo H1734 of Bethlehem H1035,
023:025 Shammah H8048 the Harodite H2733, Elika H0470 the Harodite H2733,
023:026 Helez H2503 the Paltite H6407, Ira H5896 the son H1121 of Ikkesh H6142 the Tekoite H8621,
023:027 Abiezer H0044 the Anethothite H6069, Mebunnai H4012 the Hushathite H2843,
023:028 Zalmon H6756 the Ahohite H0266, Maharai H4121 the Netophathite H5200,
023:029 Heleb H2460 the son H1121 of Baanah H1196, a Netophathite H5200, Ittai H0863 the son H1121 of Ribai H7380 out of Gibeah H1390 of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144,
023:030 Benaiah H1141 the Pirathonite H6553, Hiddai H1914 of the brooks H5158 of Gaash H1608,
023:031 Abialbon H0045 the Arbathite H6164, Azmaveth H5820 the Barhumite H1273,
023:032 Eliahba H0455 the Shaalbonite H8170, of the sons H1121 of Jashen H3464, Jonathan H3083,
023:033 Shammah H8048 the Hararite H2043, Ahiam H0279 the son H1121 of Sharar H8325 the Hararite H2043,
023:034 Eliphelet H0467 the son H1121 of Ahasbai H0308, the son H1121 of the Maachathite H4602, Eliam H0463 the son H1121 of Ahithophel H0302 the Gilonite H1526,
023:035 Hezrai H2695 the Carmelite H3761, Paarai H6474 the Arbite H0701,
023:036 Igal H3008 the son H1121 of Nathan H5416 of Zobah H6678, Bani H1137 the Gadite H1425,
023:037 Zelek H6768 the Ammonite H5984, Naharai H5171 the Beerothite H0886, armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 to Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870,
023:038 Ira H5896 an Ithrite H3505, Gareb H1619 an Ithrite H3505,
023:039 Uriah H0223 the Hittite H2850: thirty H7970 and seven H7651 in all.
024:001 ¶ And again H3254 (8686) the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8800) against Israel H3478, and he moved H5496 (8686) David H1732 against them to say H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798), number H4487 (8798) Israel H3478 and Judah H3063.
024:002 For the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) to Joab H3097 the captain H8269 of the host H2428, which [was] with him, Go now through H7751 (8798) all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884, and number H6485 (8798) ye the people H5971, that I may know H3045 (8804) the number H4557 of the people H5971.
024:003 And Joab H3097 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, Now the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 add H3254 (8686) unto the people H5971, how many soever H1992 they be, an hundredfold H3967 H6471, and that the eyes H5869 of my lord H0113 the king H4428 may see H7200 (8802) [it]: but why doth my lord H0113 the king H4428 delight H2654 (8804) in this thing H1697?
024:004 Notwithstanding the king’s H4428 word H1697 prevailed H2388 (8799) against Joab H3097, and against the captains H8269 of the host H2428. And Joab H3097 and the captains H8269 of the host H2428 went out H3318 (8799) from the presence H6440 of the king H4428, to number H6485 (8800) the people H5971 of Israel H3478.
024:005 And they passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, and pitched H2583 (8799) in Aroer H6177, on the right side H3225 of the city H5892 that [lieth] in the midst H8432 of the river H5158 of Gad H1410, and toward Jazer H3270:
024:006 Then they came H0935 (8799) to Gilead H1568, and to the land H0776 of Tahtimhodshi H8483; and they came H0935 (8799) to Danjaan H1842, and about H5439 to Zidon H6721,
024:007 And came H0935 (8799) to the strong hold H4013 of Tyre H6865, and to all the cities H5892 of the Hivites H2340, and of the Canaanites H3669: and they went out H3318 (8799) to the south H5045 of Judah H3063, [even] to Beersheba H0884.
024:008 So when they had gone H7751 (8799) through all the land H0776, they came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 at the end H7097 of nine H8672 months H2320 and twenty H6242 days H3117.
024:009 And Joab H3097 gave up H5414 (8799) the sum H4557 of the number H4662 of the people H5971 unto the king H4428: and there were in Israel H3478 eight H8083 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 valiant H2428 men H0376 (8677) H0381 that drew H8025 (8802) the sword H2719; and the men H0376 of Judah H3063 [were] five H2568 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 men H0376.
024:010 And David’s H1732 heart H3820 smote H5221 (8686) him after H0310 that he had numbered H5608 (8804) the people H5971. And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, I have sinned H2398 (8804) greatly H3966 in that I have done H6213 (8804): and now, I beseech thee, O LORD H3068, take away H5674 (8685) the iniquity H5771 of thy servant H5650; for I have done very H3966 foolishly H5528 (8738).
024:011 For when David H1732 was up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto the prophet H5030 Gad H1410, David’s H1732 seer H2374, saying H0559 (8800),
024:012 Go H1980 (8800) and say H0559 (8804) unto David H1732, Thus saith H1696 (8765) the LORD H3068, I offer H5190 (8802) thee three H7969 [things]; choose H0977 (8798) thee one H0259 of them, that I may [do it] unto thee H6213 (8799).
024:013 So Gad H1410 came H0935 (8799) to David H1732, and told H5046 (8686) him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Shall seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458 come H0935 (8799) unto thee in thy land H0776? or wilt thou flee H5127 (8800) three H7969 months H2320 before H6440 thine enemies H6862, while they pursue H7291 (8802) thee? or that there be three H7969 days H3117 ’ pestilence H1698 in thy land H0776? now advise H3045 (8798), and see H7200 (8798) what answer H1697 I shall return H7725 (8686) to him that sent H7971 (8802) me.
024:014 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Gad H1410, I am in a great H3966 strait H6887 (8804): let us fall H5307 (8799) now into the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068; for his mercies H7356 [are] great H7227: and let me not fall H5307 (8799) into the hand H3027 of man H0120.
024:015 So the LORD H3068 sent H5414 (8799) a pestilence H1698 upon Israel H3478 from the morning H1242 even to the time H6256 appointed H4150: and there died H4191 (8799) of the people H5971 from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884 seventy H7657 thousand H0505 men H0376.
024:016 And when the angel H4397 stretched out H7971 (8799) his hand H3027 upon Jerusalem H3389 to destroy H7843 (8763) it, the LORD H3068 repented H5162 (8735) him of the evil H7451, and said H0559 (8799) to the angel H4397 that destroyed H7843 (8688) the people H5971, It is enough H7227: stay H7503 (8685) now thine hand H3027. And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 was by the threshingplace H1637 of Araunah H0728 the Jebusite H2983.
024:017 And David H1732 spake H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 when he saw H7200 (8800) the angel H4397 that smote H5221 (8688) the people H5971, and said H0559 (8799), Lo, I have sinned H2398 (8804), and I have done wickedly H5753 (8689): but these sheep H6629, what have they done H6213 (8804)? let thine hand H3027, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s H0001 house H1004.
024:018 And Gad H1410 came H0935 (8799) that day H3117 to David H1732, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go up H5927 (8798), rear H6965 (8685) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068 in the threshingfloor H1637 of Araunah H0728 the Jebusite H2983.
024:019 And David H1732, according to the saying H1697 of Gad H1410, went up H5927 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765).
024:020 And Araunah H0728 looked H8259 (8686), and saw H7200 (8799) the king H4428 and his servants H5650 coming on H5674 (8802) toward him: and Araunah H0728 went out H3318 (8799), and bowed H7812 (8691) himself before the king H4428 on his face H0639 upon the ground H0776.
024:021 And Araunah H0728 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore is my lord H0113 the king H4428 come H0935 (8804) to his servant H5650? And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), To buy H7069 (8800) the threshingfloor H1637 of thee, to build H1129 (8800) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068, that the plague H4046 may be stayed H6113 (8735) from the people H5971.
024:022 And Araunah H0728 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Let my lord H0113 the king H4428 take H3947 (8799) and offer up H5927 (8686) what [seemeth] good H2896 unto him H5869: behold H7200 (8798), [here be] oxen H1241 for burnt sacrifice H5930, and threshing instruments H4173 and [other] instruments H3627 of the oxen H1241 for wood H6086.
024:023 All these [things] did Araunah H0728, [as] a king H4428, give H5414 (8804) unto the king H4428. And Araunah H0728 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, The LORD H3068 thy God H0430 accept H7521 (8799) thee.
024:024 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Araunah H0728, Nay; but I will surely H7069 (8800) buy H7069 (8799) [it] of thee at a price H4242: neither will I offer H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 unto the LORD H3068 my God H0430 of that which doth cost me nothing H2600. So David H1732 bought H7069 (8799) the threshingfloor H1637 and the oxen H1241 for fifty H2572 shekels H8255 of silver H3701.
024:025 And David H1732 built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002. So the LORD H3068 was intreated H6279 (8735) for the land H0776, and the plague H4046 was stayed H6113 (8735) from Israel H3478.
