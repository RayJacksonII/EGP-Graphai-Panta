001:001 ¶ Now after H0310 the death H4194 of Joshua H3091 it came to pass, that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 asked H7592 (8799) the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Who shall go up H5927 (8799) for us against the Canaanites H3669 first H8462, to fight H3898 (8736) against them?
001:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Judah H3063 shall go up H5927 (8799): behold, I have delivered H5414 (8804) the land H0776 into his hand H3027.
001:003 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799) unto Simeon H8095 his brother H0251, Come up H5927 (8798) with me into my lot H1486, that we may fight H3898 (8735) against the Canaanites H3669; and I likewise will go H1980 (8804) with thee into thy lot H1486. So Simeon H8095 went H3212 (8799) with him.
001:004 And Judah H3063 went up H5927 (8799); and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) the Canaanites H3669 and the Perizzites H6522 into their hand H3027: and they slew H5221 (8686) of them in Bezek H0966 ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376.
001:005 And they found H4672 (8799) Adonibezek H0137 in Bezek H0966: and they fought H3898 (8735) against him, and they slew H5221 (8686) the Canaanites H3669 and the Perizzites H6522.
001:006 But Adonibezek H0137 fled H5127 (8799); and they pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 him, and caught H0270 (8799) him, and cut off H7112 (8762) his thumbs H0931 H3027 and his great toes H7272.
001:007 And Adonibezek H0137 said H0559 (8799), Threescore and ten H7657 kings H4428, having their thumbs H0931 H3027 and their great toes H7272 cut off H7112 (8794), gathered H3950 (8764) [their meat] under my table H7979: as I have done H6213 (8804), so God H0430 hath requited H7999 (8765) me. And they brought H0935 (8686) him to Jerusalem H3389, and there he died H4191 (8799).
001:008 Now the children H1121 of Judah H3063 had fought H3898 (8735) against Jerusalem H3389, and had taken H3920 (8799) it, and smitten H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and set H7971 (8765) the city H5892 on fire H0784.
001:009 And afterward H0310 the children H1121 of Judah H3063 went down H3381 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) against the Canaanites H3669, that dwelt H3427 (8802) in the mountain H2022, and in the south H5045, and in the valley H8219.
001:010 And Judah H3063 went H3212 (8799) against the Canaanites H3669 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Hebron H2275: (now the name H8034 of Hebron H2275 before H6440 [was] Kirjatharba H7153:) and they slew H5221 (8686) Sheshai H8344, and Ahiman H0289, and Talmai H8526.
001:011 And from thence he went H3212 (8799) against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Debir H1688: and the name H8034 of Debir H1688 before H6440 [was] Kirjathsepher H7158:
001:012 And Caleb H3612 said H0559 (8799), He that smiteth H5221 (8686) Kirjathsepher H7158, and taketh H3920 (8804) it, to him will I give H5414 (8804) Achsah H5915 my daughter H1323 to wife H0802.
001:013 And Othniel H6274 the son H1121 of Kenaz H7073, Caleb’s H3612 younger H6996 brother H0251, took H3920 (8799) it: and he gave H5414 (8799) him Achsah H5915 his daughter H1323 to wife H0802.
001:014 And it came to pass, when she came H0935 (8800) [to him], that she moved H5496 (8686) him to ask H7592 (8800) of her father H0001 a field H7704: and she lighted H6795 (8799) from off [her] ass H2543; and Caleb H3612 said H0559 (8799) unto her, What wilt thou?
001:015 And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, Give H3051 (8798) me a blessing H1293: for thou hast given H5414 (8804) me a south H5045 land H0776; give H5414 (8804) me also springs H1543 of water H4325. And Caleb H3612 gave H5414 (8799) her the upper H5942 springs H1543 and the nether H8482 springs H1543.
001:016 And the children H1121 of the Kenite H7017, Moses H4872 ’ father in law H2859 (8802), went up H5927 (8804) out of the city H5892 of palm trees H8558 (8677) H5899 with the children H1121 of Judah H3063 into the wilderness H4057 of Judah H3063, which [lieth] in the south H5045 of Arad H6166; and they went H3212 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) among H0854 the people H5971.
001:017 And Judah H3063 went H3212 (8799) with Simeon H8095 his brother H0251, and they slew H5221 (8686) the Canaanites H3669 that inhabited H3427 (8802) Zephath H6857, and utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) it. And the name H8034 of the city H5892 was called H7121 (8799) Hormah H2767.
001:018 Also Judah H3063 took H3920 (8799) Gaza H5804 with the coast H1366 thereof, and Askelon H0831 with the coast H1366 thereof, and Ekron H6138 with the coast H1366 thereof.
001:019 And the LORD H3068 was with Judah H3063; and he drave out H3423 (8686) [the inhabitants of] the mountain H2022; but could not H3808 drive out H3423 (8687) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the valley H6010, because they had chariots H7393 of iron H1270.
001:020 And they gave H5414 (8799) Hebron H2275 unto Caleb H3612, as Moses H4872 said H1696 (8765): and he expelled H3423 (8686) thence the three H7969 sons H1121 of Anak H6061.
001:021 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 did not drive out H3423 (8689) the Jebusites H2983 that inhabited H3427 (8802) Jerusalem H3389; but the Jebusites H2983 dwell H3427 (8799) with the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 in Jerusalem H3389 unto this day H3117.
001:022 And the house H1004 of Joseph H3130, they also went up H5927 (8799) against Bethel H1008: and the LORD H3068 [was] with them.
001:023 And the house H1004 of Joseph H3130 sent to descry H8446 (8686) Bethel H1008. (Now the name H8034 of the city H5892 before H6440 [was] Luz H3870.)
001:024 And the spies H8104 (8802) saw H7200 (8799) a man H0376 come forth H3318 (8802) out of the city H5892, and they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Shew H7200 (8685) us, we pray thee, the entrance H3996 into the city H5892, and we will shew H6213 (8804) thee mercy H2617.
001:025 And when he shewed H7200 (8686) them the entrance H3996 into the city H5892, they smote H5221 (8686) the city H5892 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; but they let go H7971 (8765) the man H0376 and all his family H4940.
001:026 And the man H0376 went H3212 (8799) into the land H0776 of the Hittites H2850, and built H1129 (8799) a city H5892, and called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 thereof Luz H3870: which [is] the name H8034 thereof unto this day H3117.
001:027 Neither did Manasseh H4519 drive out H3423 (8689) [the inhabitants of] Bethshean H1052 and her towns H1323, nor Taanach H8590 and her towns H1323, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Dor H1756 and her towns H1323, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Ibleam H2991 and her towns H1323, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Megiddo H4023 and her towns H1323: but the Canaanites H3669 would H2974 (8686) dwell H3427 (8800) in that land H0776.
001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel H3478 was strong H2388 (8804), that they put H7760 (8799) the Canaanites H3669 to tribute H4522, and did not utterly H3423 (8687) drive them out H3423 (8689).
001:029 Neither did Ephraim H0669 drive out H3423 (8689) the Canaanites H3669 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Gezer H1507; but the Canaanites H3669 dwelt H3427 (8799) in Gezer H1507 among H7130 them.
001:030 Neither did Zebulun H2074 drive out H3423 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Kitron H7003, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Nahalol H5096; but the Canaanites H3669 dwelt H3427 (8799) among H7130 them, and became tributaries H4522.
001:031 Neither did Asher H0836 drive out H3423 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Accho H5910, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Zidon H6721, nor of Ahlab H0303, nor of Achzib H0392, nor of Helbah H2462, nor of Aphik H0663, nor of Rehob H7340:
001:032 But the Asherites H0843 dwelt H3427 (8799) among H7130 the Canaanites H3669, the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776: for they did not drive them out H3423 (8689).
001:033 Neither did Naphtali H5321 drive out H3423 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Bethshemesh H1053, nor the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Bethanath H1043; but he dwelt H3427 (8799) among H7130 the Canaanites H3669, the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776: nevertheless the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Bethshemesh H1053 and of Bethanath H1043 became tributaries H4522 unto them.
001:034 And the Amorites H0567 forced H3905 (8799) the children H1121 of Dan H1835 into the mountain H2022: for they would not suffer H5414 (8804) them to come down H3381 (8800) to the valley H6010:
001:035 But the Amorites H0567 would H2974 (8686) dwell H3427 (8800) in mount H2022 Heres H2776 in Aijalon H0357, and in Shaalbim H8169: yet the hand H3027 of the house H1004 of Joseph H3130 prevailed H3513 (8799), so that they became tributaries H4522.
001:036 And the coast H1366 of the Amorites H0567 [was] from the going up H4608 to Akrabbim H4610, from the rock H5553, and upward H4605.
002:001 ¶ And an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 came up H5927 (8799) from Gilgal H1537 to Bochim H1066, and said H0559 (8799), I made you to go up H5927 (8686) out of Egypt H4714, and have brought H0935 (8686) you unto the land H0776 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001; and I said H0559 (8799), I will never H5769 break H6565 (8686) my covenant H1285 with you.
002:002 And ye shall make H3772 (8799) no league H1285 with the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of this land H0776; ye shall throw down H5422 (8799) their altars H4196: but ye have not obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963: why have ye done H6213 (8804) this?
002:003 Wherefore I also said H0559 (8804), I will not drive them out H1644 (8762) from before H6440 you; but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides H6654, and their gods H0430 shall be a snare H4170 unto you.
002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8763) these words H1697 unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that the people H5971 lifted up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
002:005 And they called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Bochim H1066: and they sacrificed H2076 (8799) there unto the LORD H3068.
002:006 And when Joshua H3091 had let the people H5971 go H7971 (8762), the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went H3212 (8799) every man H0376 unto his inheritance H5159 to possess H3423 (8800) the land H0776.
002:007 And the people H5971 served H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068 all the days H3117 of Joshua H3091, and all the days H3117 of the elders H2205 that outlived H0748 (8689) H3117 H0310 Joshua H3091, who had seen H7200 (8804) all the great H1419 works H4639 of the LORD H3068, that he did H6213 (8804) for Israel H3478.
002:008 And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068, died H4191 (8799), [being] an hundred H3967 and ten H6235 years H8141 old H1121.
002:009 And they buried H6912 (8799) him in the border H1366 of his inheritance H5159 in Timnathheres H8556, in the mount H2022 of Ephraim H0669, on the north side H6828 of the hill H2022 Gaash H1608.
002:010 And also all that generation H1755 were gathered H0622 (8738) unto their fathers H0001: and there arose H6965 (8799) another H0312 generation H1755 after H0310 them, which knew H3045 (8804) not the LORD H3068, nor yet the works H4639 which he had done H6213 (8804) for Israel H3478.
002:011 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8799) Baalim H1168:
002:012 And they forsook H5800 (8799) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, which brought them out H3318 (8688) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and followed H3212 (8799) H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, of the gods H0430 of the people H5971 that [were] round about H5439 them, and bowed H7812 (8691) themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD H3068 to anger H3707 (8686).
002:013 And they forsook H5800 (8799) the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8799) Baal H1168 and Ashtaroth H6252.
002:014 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was hot H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478, and he delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hands H3027 of spoilers H8154 (8802) that spoiled H8155 (8799) them, and he sold H4376 (8799) them into the hands H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439, so that they could H3201 (8804) not any longer H5750 stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802).
002:015 Whithersoever they went out H3318 (8804), the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was against them for evil H7451, as the LORD H3068 had said H1696 (8765), and as the LORD H3068 had sworn H7650 (8738) unto them: and they were greatly H3966 distressed H3334 (8799).
002:016 Nevertheless the LORD H3068 raised up H6965 (8686) judges H8199 (8802), which delivered H3467 (8686) them out of the hand H3027 of those that spoiled H8154 (8802) them.
002:017 And yet they would not hearken H8085 (8804) unto their judges H8199 (8802), but they went a whoring H2181 (8804) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, and bowed H7812 (8691) themselves unto them: they turned H5493 (8804) quickly H4118 out of the way H1870 which their fathers H0001 walked in H1980 (8804), obeying H8085 (8800) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068; [but] they did H6213 (8804) not so.
002:018 And when the LORD H3068 raised H6965 (8689) them up judges H8199 (8802), then the LORD H3068 was with the judge H8199 (8802), and delivered H3467 (8689) them out of the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802) all the days H3117 of the judge H8199 (8802): for it repented H5162 (8735) the LORD H3068 because H6440 of their groanings H5009 by reason of them that oppressed H3905 (8801) them and vexed H1766 (8802) them.
002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge H8199 (8802) was dead H4194, [that] they returned H7725 (8799), and corrupted H7843 (8689) [themselves] more than their fathers H0001, in following H3212 (8800) H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to serve H5647 (8800) them, and to bow down H7812 (8692) unto them; they ceased H5307 (8689) not from their own doings H4611, nor from their stubborn H7186 way H1870.
002:020 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was hot H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478; and he said H0559 (8799), Because that this people H1471 hath transgressed H5674 (8804) my covenant H1285 which I commanded H6680 (8765) their fathers H0001, and have not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto my voice H6963;
002:021 I also will not henceforth H3254 (8686) drive out H3423 (8687) any H0376 from before H6440 them of the nations H1471 which Joshua H3091 left H5800 (8804) when he died H4191 (8799):
002:022 That through them I may prove H5254 (8763) Israel H3478, whether they will keep H8104 (8802) the way H1870 of the LORD H3068 to walk H3212 (8800) therein, as their fathers H0001 did keep H8104 (8804) [it], or not.
002:023 Therefore the LORD H3068 left H3240 (8686) those nations H1471, without H1115 driving them out H3423 (8687) hastily H4118; neither delivered H5414 (8804) he them into the hand H3027 of Joshua H3091.
003:001 ¶ Now these [are] the nations H1471 which the LORD H3068 left H3240 (8689), to prove H5254 (8763) Israel H3478 by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known H3045 (8804) all the wars H4421 of Canaan H3667;
003:002 Only that H7535 the generations H1755 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 might know H3045 (8800), to teach H3925 (8763) them war H4421, at the least such as before H6440 knew H3045 (8804) nothing thereof;
003:003 [Namely], five H2568 lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430, and all the Canaanites H3669, and the Sidonians H6722, and the Hivites H2340 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in mount H2022 Lebanon H3844, from mount H2022 Baalhermon H1179 unto the entering in H0935 (8800) of Hamath H2574.
003:004 And they were to prove H5254 (8763) Israel H3478 by them, to know H3045 (8800) whether they would hearken H8085 (8799) unto the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068, which he commanded H6680 (8765) their fathers H0001 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
003:005 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8804) among H7130 the Canaanites H3669, Hittites H2850, and Amorites H0567, and Perizzites H6522, and Hivites H2340, and Jebusites H2983:
003:006 And they took H3947 (8799) their daughters H1323 to be their wives H0802, and gave H5414 (8804) their daughters H1323 to their sons H1121, and served H5647 (8799) their gods H0430.
003:007 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and forgat H7911 (8799) the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and served H5647 (8799) Baalim H1168 and the groves H0842.
003:008 Therefore the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was hot H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478, and he sold H4376 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Chushanrishathaim H3573 king H4428 of Mesopotamia H0763: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 served H5647 (8799) Chushanrishathaim H3573 eight H8083 years H8141.
003:009 And when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, the LORD H3068 raised up H6965 (8686) a deliverer H3467 (8688) to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, who delivered H3467 (8686) them, [even] Othniel H6274 the son H1121 of Kenaz H7073, Caleb’s H3612 younger H6996 brother H0251.
003:010 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came upon him, and he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478, and went out H3318 (8799) to war H4421: and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) Chushanrishathaim H3573 king H4428 of Mesopotamia H0763 into his hand H3027; and his hand H3027 prevailed H5810 (8799) against Chushanrishathaim H3573.
003:011 And the land H0776 had rest H8252 (8799) forty H0705 years H8141. And Othniel H6274 the son H1121 of Kenaz H7073 died H4191 (8799).
003:012 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8800) evil H7451 again H3254 (8686) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: and the LORD H3068 strengthened H2388 (8762) Eglon H5700 the king H4428 of Moab H4124 against Israel H3478, because they had done H6213 (8804) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
003:013 And he gathered H0622 (8799) unto him the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 and Amalek H6002, and went H3212 (8799) and smote H5221 (8686) Israel H3478, and possessed H3423 (8799) the city H5892 of palm trees H8558 (8677) H5899.
003:014 So the children H1121 of Israel H3478 served H5647 (8799) Eglon H5700 the king H4428 of Moab H4124 eighteen H8083 H6240 years H8141.
003:015 But when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, the LORD H3068 raised them up H6965 (8686) a deliverer H3467 (8688), Ehud H0164 the son H1121 of Gera H1617, a Benjamite H1145, a man H0376 lefthanded H0334 H3225: and by him H3027 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) a present H4503 unto Eglon H5700 the king H4428 of Moab H4124.
003:016 But Ehud H0164 made H6213 (8799) him a dagger H2719 which had two H8147 edges H6366, of a cubit H1574 length H0753; and he did gird H2296 (8799) it under his raiment H4055 upon his right H3225 thigh H3409.
003:017 And he brought H7126 (8686) the present H4503 unto Eglon H5700 king H4428 of Moab H4124: and Eglon H5700 [was] a very H3966 fat H1277 man H0376.
003:018 And when he had made an end H3615 (8765) to offer H7126 (8687) the present H4503, he sent away H7971 (8762) the people H5971 that bare H5375 (8802) the present H4503.
003:019 But he himself turned again H7725 (8804) from the quarries H6456 that [were] by Gilgal H1537, and said H0559 (8799), I have a secret H5643 errand H1697 unto thee, O king H4428: who said H0559 (8799), Keep silence H2013 (8761). And all that stood H5975 (8802) by him went out H3318 (8799) from him.
003:020 And Ehud H0164 came H0935 (8804) unto him; and he was sitting H3427 (8802) in a summer H4747 parlour H5944, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud H0164 said H0559 (8799), I have a message H1697 from God H0430 unto thee. And he arose H6965 (8799) out of [his] seat H3678.
003:021 And Ehud H0164 put forth H7971 (8799) his left H8040 hand H3027, and took H3947 (8799) the dagger H2719 from his right H3225 thigh H3409, and thrust H8628 (8799) it into his belly H0990:
003:022 And the haft H5325 also went in H0935 (8799) after H0310 the blade H3851; and the fat H2459 closed H5462 (8799) upon H1157 the blade H3851, so that he could not draw H8025 (8804) the dagger H2719 out of his belly H0990; and the dirt H6574 came out H3318 (8799).
003:023 Then Ehud H0164 went forth H3318 (8799) through the porch H4528, and shut H5462 (8799) the doors H1817 of the parlour H5944 upon him, and locked H5274 (8804) them.
003:024 When he was gone out H3318 (8804), his servants H5650 came H0935 (8804); and when they saw H7200 (8799) that, behold, the doors H1817 of the parlour H5944 [were] locked H5274 (8803), they said H0559 (8799), Surely he covereth H5526 (8688) his feet H7272 in his summer H4747 chamber H2315.
003:025 And they tarried H2342 (8799) till they were ashamed H0954 (8800): and, behold, he opened H6605 (8802) not the doors H1817 of the parlour H5944; therefore they took H3947 (8799) a key H4668, and opened H6605 (8799) [them]: and, behold, their lord H0113 [was] fallen down H5307 (8802) dead H4191 (8801) on the earth H0776.
003:026 And Ehud H0164 escaped H4422 (8738) while they tarried H4102 (8699), and passed beyond H5674 (8804) the quarries H6456, and escaped H4422 (8735) unto Seirath H8167.
003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come H0935 (8800), that he blew H8628 (8799) a trumpet H7782 in the mountain H2022 of Ephraim H0669, and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went down H3381 (8799) with him from the mount H2022, and he before H6440 them.
003:028 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Follow H7291 (8798) after H0310 me: for the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) your enemies H0341 (8802) the Moabites H4124 into your hand H3027. And they went down H3381 (8799) after H0310 him, and took H3920 (8799) the fords H4569 of Jordan H3383 toward Moab H4124, and suffered H5414 (8804) not a man H0376 to pass over H5674 (8800).
003:029 And they slew H5221 (8686) of Moab H4124 at that time H6256 about ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376, all lusty H8082, and all men H0376 of valour H2428; and there escaped H4422 (8738) not a man H0376.
003:030 So Moab H4124 was subdued H3665 (8735) that day H3117 under the hand H3027 of Israel H3478. And the land H0776 had rest H8252 (8799) fourscore H8084 years H8141.
003:031 And after H0310 him was Shamgar H8044 the son H1121 of Anath H6067, which slew H5221 (8686) of the Philistines H6430 six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 with an ox H1241 goad H4451: and he also delivered H3467 (8686) Israel H3478.
004:001 ¶ And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 again H3254 (8686) did H6213 (8800) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, when Ehud H0164 was dead H4191 (8804).
004:002 And the LORD H3068 sold H4376 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Jabin H2985 king H4428 of Canaan H3667, that reigned H4427 (8804) in Hazor H2674; the captain H8269 of whose host H6635 [was] Sisera H5516, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in Harosheth H2800 of the Gentiles H1471.
004:003 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068: for he had nine H8672 hundred H3967 chariots H7393 of iron H1270; and twenty H6242 years H8141 he mightily H2394 oppressed H3905 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
004:004 And Deborah H1683, a prophetess H5031, the wife H0802 of Lapidoth H3941, she judged H8199 (8802) Israel H3478 at that time H6256.
004:005 And she dwelt H3427 (8802) under the palm tree H8560 of Deborah H1683 between Ramah H7414 and Bethel H1008 in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 came up H5927 (8799) to her for judgment H4941.
004:006 And she sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) Barak H1301 the son H1121 of Abinoam H0042 out of Kedeshnaphtali H6943, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Hath not the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 commanded H6680 (8765), [saying], Go H3212 (8798) and draw H4900 (8804) toward mount H2022 Tabor H8396, and take H3947 (8804) with thee ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376 of the children H1121 of Naphtali H5321 and of the children H1121 of Zebulun H2074?
004:007 And I will draw H4900 (8804) unto thee to the river H5158 Kishon H7028 Sisera H5516, the captain H8269 of Jabin’s H2985 army H6635, with his chariots H7393 and his multitude H1995; and I will deliver H5414 (8804) him into thine hand H3027.
004:008 And Barak H1301 said H0559 (8799) unto her, If thou wilt go H3212 (8799) with me, then I will go H1980 (8804): but if thou wilt not go H3212 (8799) with me, [then] I will not go H3212 (8799).
004:009 And she said H0559 (8799), I will surely H1980 (8800) go H3212 (8799) with thee: notwithstanding H0657 the journey H1870 that thou takest H1980 (8802) shall not be for thine honour H8597; for the LORD H3068 shall sell H4376 (8799) Sisera H5516 into the hand H3027 of a woman H0802. And Deborah H1683 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) with Barak H1301 to Kedesh H6943.
004:010 And Barak H1301 called H2199 (8686) Zebulun H2074 and Naphtali H5321 to Kedesh H6943; and he went up H5927 (8799) with ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376 at his feet H7272: and Deborah H1683 went up H5927 (8799) with him.
004:011 Now Heber H2268 the Kenite H7017, [which was] of the children H1121 of Hobab H2246 the father in law H2859 (8802) of Moses H4872, had severed H6504 (8737) himself from the Kenites H7014, and pitched H5186 (8799) his tent H0168 unto the plain H0436 of Zaanaim H6815, which [is] by Kedesh H6943.
004:012 And they shewed H5046 (8686) Sisera H5516 that Barak H1301 the son H1121 of Abinoam H0042 was gone up H5927 (8804) to mount H2022 Tabor H8396.
004:013 And Sisera H5516 gathered together H2199 (8686) all his chariots H7393, [even] nine H8672 hundred H3967 chariots H7393 of iron H1270, and all the people H5971 that [were] with him, from Harosheth H2800 of the Gentiles H1471 unto the river H5158 of Kishon H7028.
004:014 And Deborah H1683 said H0559 (8799) unto Barak H1301, Up H6965 (8798); for this [is] the day H3117 in which the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) Sisera H5516 into thine hand H3027: is not the LORD H3068 gone out H3318 (8804) before H6440 thee? So Barak H1301 went down H3381 (8799) from mount H2022 Tabor H8396, and ten H6235 thousand H0505 men H0376 after H0310 him.
004:015 And the LORD H3068 discomfited H2000 (8799) Sisera H5516, and all [his] chariots H7393, and all [his] host H4264, with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719 before H6440 Barak H1301; so that Sisera H5516 lighted down H3381 (8799) off [his] chariot H4818, and fled away H5127 (8799) on his feet H7272.
004:016 But Barak H1301 pursued H7291 (8804) after H0310 the chariots H7393, and after the host H4264, unto Harosheth H2800 of the Gentiles H1471: and all the host H4264 of Sisera H5516 fell H5307 (8799) upon the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; [and] there was not a man H0259 left H7604 (8738).
004:017 Howbeit Sisera H5516 fled away H5127 (8804) on his feet H7272 to the tent H0168 of Jael H3278 the wife H0802 of Heber H2268 the Kenite H7017: for [there was] peace H7965 between Jabin H2985 the king H4428 of Hazor H2674 and the house H1004 of Heber H2268 the Kenite H7017.
004:018 And Jael H3278 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) Sisera H5516, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Turn in H5493 (8798), my lord H0113, turn in H5493 (8798) to me; fear H3372 (8799) not. And when he had turned in H5493 (8799) unto her into the tent H0168, she covered H3680 (8762) him with a mantle H8063.
004:019 And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little H4592 water H4325 to drink H8248 (8685); for I am thirsty H6770 (8804). And she opened H6605 (8799) a bottle H4997 of milk H2461, and gave him drink H8248 (8686), and covered H3680 (8762) him.
004:020 Again he said H0559 (8799) unto her, Stand in H5975 (8798) the door H6607 of the tent H0168, and it shall be, when any man H0376 doth come H0935 (8799) and enquire H7592 (8804) of thee, and say H0559 (8804), Is there H3426 any man H0376 here H3426? that thou shalt say H0559 (8804), No.
004:021 Then Jael H3278 Heber’s H2268 wife H0802 took H3947 (8799) a nail H3489 of the tent H0168, and took H7760 (8799) an hammer H4718 in her hand H3027, and went H0935 (8799) softly H3814 unto him, and smote H8628 (8799) the nail H3489 into his temples H7541, and fastened H6795 (8799) it into the ground H0776: for he was fast asleep H7290 (8738) and weary H5774 (8799). So he died H4191 (8799).
004:022 And, behold, as Barak H1301 pursued H7291 (8802) Sisera H5516, Jael H3278 came out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Come H3212 (8798), and I will shew H7200 (8686) thee the man H0376 whom thou seekest H1245 (8764). And when he came H0935 (8799) into her [tent], behold, Sisera H5516 lay H5307 (8802) dead H4191 (8801), and the nail H3489 [was] in his temples H7541.
004:023 So God H0430 subdued H3665 (8686) on that day H3117 Jabin H2985 the king H4428 of Canaan H3667 before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
004:024 And the hand H3027 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 prospered H3212 (8799) H1980 (8800), and prevailed H7186 against Jabin H2985 the king H4428 of Canaan H3667, until they had destroyed H3772 (8689) Jabin H2985 king H4428 of Canaan H3667.
005:001 ¶ Then sang H7891 (8799) Deborah H1683 and Barak H1301 the son H1121 of Abinoam H0042 on that day H3117, saying H0559 (8800),
005:002 Praise H1288 (8761) ye the LORD H3068 for the avenging H6544 (8800) H6546 of Israel H3478, when the people H5971 willingly offered H5068 (8692) themselves.
005:003 Hear H8085 (8798), O ye kings H4428; give ear H0238 (8685), O ye princes H7336 (8802); I, [even] I, will sing H7891 (8799) unto the LORD H3068; I will sing H2167 (8762) [praise] to the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
005:004 LORD H3068, when thou wentest out H3318 (8800) of Seir H8165, when thou marchedst out H6805 (8800) of the field H7704 of Edom H0123, the earth H0776 trembled H7493 (8804), and the heavens H8064 dropped H5197 (8804), the clouds H5645 also dropped H5197 (8804) water H4325.
005:005 The mountains H2022 melted H5140 (8804) from before H6440 the LORD H3068, [even] that Sinai H5514 from before H6440 the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
005:006 In the days H3117 of Shamgar H8044 the son H1121 of Anath H6067, in the days H3117 of Jael H3278, the highways H0734 were unoccupied H2308 (8804), and the travellers H1980 (8802) walked H3212 (8799) through byways H6128 H5410.
005:007 [The inhabitants of] the villages H6520 ceased H2308 (8804), they ceased H2308 (8804) in Israel H3478, until that I Deborah H1683 arose H6965 (8804), that I arose H6965 (8804) a mother H0517 in Israel H3478.
005:008 They chose H0977 (8799) new H2319 gods H0430; then [was] war H3901 in the gates H8179: was there a shield H4043 or spear H7420 seen H7200 (8735) among forty H0705 thousand H0505 in Israel H3478?
005:009 My heart H3820 [is] toward the governors H2710 (8802) of Israel H3478, that offered themselves willingly H5068 (8693) among the people H5971. Bless H1288 (8761) ye the LORD H3068.
005:010 Speak H7878 (8798), ye that ride H7392 (8802) on white H6715 asses H0860, ye that sit H3427 (8802) in judgment H4055, and walk H1980 (8802) by the way H1870.
005:011 [They that are delivered] from the noise H6963 of archers H2686 (8764) in the places of drawing water H4857, there shall they rehearse H8567 (8762) the righteous acts H6666 of the LORD H3068, [even] the righteous acts H6666 [toward the inhabitants] of his villages H6520 in Israel H3478: then shall the people H5971 of the LORD H3068 go down H3381 (8804) to the gates H8179.
005:012 Awake H5782 (8798), awake H5782 (8798), Deborah H1683: awake H5782 (8798), awake H5782 (8798), utter H1696 (8761) a song H7892: arise H6965 (8798), Barak H1301, and lead thy captivity H7628 captive H7617 (8798), thou son H1121 of Abinoam H0042.
005:013 Then he made him that remaineth H8300 have dominion H7287 (8762) over the nobles H0117 among the people H5971: the LORD H3068 made me have dominion H7287 (8762) over the mighty H1368.
005:014 Out of Ephraim H0669 [was there] a root H8328 of them against Amalek H6002; after H0310 thee, Benjamin H1144, among thy people H5971; out of Machir H4353 came down H3381 (8804) governors H2710 (8781), and out of Zebulun H2074 they that handle H4900 (8802) the pen H7626 of the writer H5608 (8802).
005:015 And the princes H8269 of Issachar H3485 [were] with Deborah H1683; even Issachar H3485, and also Barak H1301: he was sent H7971 (8795) on foot H7272 into the valley H6010. For the divisions H6390 of Reuben H7205 [there were] great H1419 thoughts H2711 of heart H3820.
005:016 Why abodest H3427 (8804) thou among H0996 the sheepfolds H4942, to hear H8085 (8800) the bleatings H8292 of the flocks H5739? For the divisions H6390 of Reuben H7205 [there were] great H1419 searchings H2714 of heart H3820.
005:017 Gilead H1568 abode H7931 (8804) beyond H5676 Jordan H3383: and why did Dan H1835 remain H1481 (8799) in ships H0591? Asher H0836 continued H3427 (8804) on the sea H3220 shore H2348, and abode H7931 (8799) in his breaches H4664.
005:018 Zebulun H2074 and Naphtali H5321 [were] a people H5971 [that] jeoparded H2778 (8765) their lives H5315 unto the death H4191 (8800) in the high places H4791 of the field H7704.
005:019 The kings H4428 came H0935 (8804) [and] fought H3898 (8738), then fought H3898 (8738) the kings H4428 of Canaan H3667 in Taanach H8590 by the waters H4325 of Megiddo H4023; they took H3947 (8804) no gain H1215 of money H3701.
005:020 They fought H3898 (8738) from heaven H8064; the stars H3556 in their courses H4546 fought H3898 (8738) against Sisera H5516.
005:021 The river H5158 of Kishon H7028 swept them away H1640 (8804), that ancient H6917 river H5158, the river H5158 Kishon H7028. O my soul H5315, thou hast trodden down H1869 (8799) strength H5797.
005:022 Then were the horsehoofs H6119 H5483 broken H1986 (8804) by the means of the pransings H1726, the pransings H1726 of their mighty ones H0047.
005:023 Curse H0779 (8798) ye Meroz H4789, said H0559 (8804) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, curse H0779 (8798) ye bitterly H0779 (8800) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof; because they came H0935 (8804) not to the help H5833 of the LORD H3068, to the help H5833 of the LORD H3068 against the mighty H1368.
005:024 Blessed H1288 (8792) above women H0802 shall Jael H3278 the wife H0802 of Heber H2268 the Kenite H7017 be, blessed H1288 (8792) shall she be above women H0802 in the tent H0168.
005:025 He asked H7592 (8804) water H4325, [and] she gave H5414 (8804) [him] milk H2461; she brought forth H7126 (8689) butter H2529 in a lordly H0117 dish H5602.
005:026 She put H7971 (8799) her hand H3027 to the nail H3489, and her right hand H3225 to the workmen’s H6001 hammer H1989; and with the hammer she smote H1986 (8804) Sisera H5516, she smote off H4277 (8804) his head H7218, when she had pierced H4272 (8804) and stricken through H2498 (8804) his temples H7541.
005:027 At her feet H7272 he bowed H3766 (8804), he fell H5307 (8804), he lay down H7901 (8804): at her feet H7272 he bowed H3766 (8804), he fell H5307 (8804): where H0834 he bowed H3766 (8804), there he fell down H5307 (8804) dead H7703 (8803).
005:028 The mother H0517 of Sisera H5516 looked H8259 (8738) out at a window H2474, and cried H2980 (8762) through the lattice H0822, Why is his chariot H7393 [so] long H0954 (8765) in coming H0935 (8800)? why tarry H0309 (8765) the wheels H6471 of his chariots H4818?
005:029 Her wise H2450 ladies H8282 answered H6030 (8799) her, yea, she returned H7725 (8686) answer H0561 to herself,
005:030 Have they not sped H4672 (8799)? have they [not] divided H2505 (8762) the prey H7998; to every H7218 man H1397 a damsel H7356 [or] two H7361; to Sisera H5516 a prey H7998 of divers colours H6648, a prey H7998 of divers colours H6648 of needlework H7553, of divers colours H6648 of needlework on both sides H7553, [meet] for the necks H6677 of [them that take] the spoil H7998?
005:031 So let all thine enemies H0341 (8802) perish H0006 (8799), O LORD H3068: but [let] them that love H0157 (8802) him [be] as the sun H8121 when he goeth forth H3318 (8800) in his might H1369. And the land H0776 had rest H8252 (8799) forty H0705 years H8141.
006:001 ¶ And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Midian H4080 seven H7651 years H8141.
006:002 And the hand H3027 of Midian H4080 prevailed H5810 (8799) against Israel H3478: [and] because H6440 of the Midianites H4080 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 made H6213 (8804) them the dens H4492 which [are] in the mountains H2022, and caves H4631, and strong holds H4679.
006:003 And [so] it was, when Israel H3478 had sown H2232 (8804), that the Midianites H4080 came up H5927 (8804), and the Amalekites H6002, and the children H1121 of the east H6924, even they came up H5927 (8804) against them;
006:004 And they encamped H2583 (8799) against them, and destroyed H7843 (8686) the increase H2981 of the earth H0776, till thou come H0935 (8800) unto Gaza H5804, and left H7604 (8686) no sustenance H4241 for Israel H3478, neither sheep H7716, nor ox H7794, nor ass H2543.
006:005 For they came up H5927 (8799) with their cattle H4735 and their tents H0168, and they came H0935 (8804) (8675) H0935 (8799) as H1767 grasshoppers H0697 for multitude H7230; [for] both they and their camels H1581 were without number H4557: and they entered H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 to destroy H7843 (8763) it.
006:006 And Israel H3478 was greatly H3966 impoverished H1809 (8735) because H6440 of the Midianites H4080; and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068.
006:007 And it came to pass, when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H2199 (8804) unto the LORD H3068 because H0182 of the Midianites H4080,
006:008 That the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) a prophet H0376 H5030 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, I brought you up H5927 (8689) from Egypt H4714, and brought you forth H3318 (8686) out of the house H1004 of bondage H5650;
006:009 And I delivered H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of the Egyptians H4714, and out of the hand H3027 of all that oppressed H3905 (8801) you, and drave them out H1644 (8762) from before H6440 you, and gave H5414 (8799) you their land H0776;
006:010 And I said H0559 (8799) unto you, I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430; fear H3372 (8799) not the gods H0430 of the Amorites H0567, in whose land H0776 ye dwell H3427 (8802): but ye have not obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963.
006:011 And there came H0935 (8799) an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, and sat H3427 (8799) under an oak H0424 which [was] in Ophrah H6084, that [pertained] unto Joash H3101 the Abiezrite H0033: and his son H1121 Gideon H1439 threshed H2251 (8802) wheat H2406 by the winepress H1660, to hide H5127 (8687) [it] from H6440 the Midianites H4080.
006:012 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, The LORD H3068 [is] with thee, thou mighty H1368 man of valour H2428.
006:013 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Oh H0994 my Lord H0113, if H3426 the LORD H3068 be with us, why then is all this befallen H4672 (8804) us? and where [be] all his miracles H6381 (8737) which our fathers H0001 told H5608 (8765) us of, saying H0559 (8800), Did not the LORD H3068 bring us up H5927 (8689) from Egypt H4714? but now the LORD H3068 hath forsaken H5203 (8804) us, and delivered H5414 (8799) us into the hands H3709 of the Midianites H4080.
006:014 And the LORD H3068 looked H6437 (8799) upon him, and said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798) in this thy might H3581, and thou shalt save H3467 (8689) Israel H3478 from the hand H3709 of the Midianites H4080: have not I sent H7971 (8804) thee?
006:015 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Oh H0994 my Lord H0136, wherewith H4100 shall I save H3467 (8686) Israel H3478? behold, my family H0504 (8676) H0505 [is] poor H1800 in Manasseh H4519, and I [am] the least H6810 in my father’s H0001 house H1004.
006:016 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite H5221 (8689) the Midianites H4080 as one H0259 man H0376.
006:017 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, If now I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, then shew H6213 (8804) me a sign H0226 that thou talkest H1696 (8764) with me.
006:018 Depart H4185 (8799) not hence, I pray thee, until I come H0935 (8800) unto thee, and bring forth H3318 (8689) my present H4503, and set H3240 (8689) [it] before H6440 thee. And he said H0559 (8799), I will tarry H3427 (8799) until thou come again H7725 (8800).
006:019 And Gideon H1439 went in H0935 (8804), and made ready H6213 (8799) a kid H5795 H1423, and unleavened cakes H4682 of an ephah H0374 of flour H7058: the flesh H1320 he put H7760 (8804) in a basket H5536, and he put H7760 (8804) the broth H4839 in a pot H6517, and brought [it] out H3318 (8686) unto him under the oak H0424, and presented H5066 (8686) [it].
006:020 And the angel H4397 of God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Take H3947 (8798) the flesh H1320 and the unleavened cakes H4682, and lay H3240 (8685) [them] upon this H1975 rock H5553, and pour out H8210 (8798) the broth H4839. And he did H6213 (8799) so.
006:021 Then the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 put forth H7971 (8799) the end H7097 of the staff H4938 that [was] in his hand H3027, and touched H5060 (8799) the flesh H1320 and the unleavened cakes H4682; and there rose up H5927 (8799) fire H0784 out of the rock H6697, and consumed H0398 (8799) the flesh H1320 and the unleavened cakes H4682. Then the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 departed H1980 (8804) out of his sight H5869.
006:022 And when Gideon H1439 perceived H7200 (8799) that he [was] an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799), Alas H0162, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069! for because H3651 I have seen H7200 (8804) an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 face H6440 to face H6440.
006:023 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Peace H7965 [be] unto thee; fear H3372 (8799) not: thou shalt not die H4191 (8799).
006:024 Then Gideon H1439 built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 there unto the LORD H3068, and called H7121 (8799) it Jehovahshalom H3073: unto this day H3117 it [is] yet in Ophrah H6084 of the Abiezrites H0033.
006:025 And it came to pass the same night H3915, that the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Take H3947 (8798) thy father’s H0001 young H6499 bullock H7794, even the second H8145 bullock H6499 of seven H7651 years old H8141, and throw down H2040 (8804) the altar H4196 of Baal H1168 that thy father H0001 hath, and cut down H3772 (8799) the grove H0842 that [is] by it:
006:026 And build H1129 (8804) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 upon the top H7218 of this rock H4581, in the ordered place H4634, and take H3947 (8804) the second H8145 bullock H6499, and offer H5927 (8689) a burnt sacrifice H5930 with the wood H6086 of the grove H0842 which thou shalt cut down H3772 (8799).
006:027 Then Gideon H1439 took H3947 (8799) ten H6235 men H0582 of his servants H5650, and did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 had said H1696 (8765) unto him: and [so] it was, because he feared H3372 (8804) his father’s H0001 household H1004, and the men H0582 of the city H5892, that he could not do H6213 (8800) [it] by day H3119, that he did H6213 (8799) [it] by night H3915.
006:028 And when the men H0582 of the city H5892 arose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, behold, the altar H4196 of Baal H1168 was cast down H5422 (8795), and the grove H0842 was cut down H3772 (8795) that [was] by it, and the second H8145 bullock H6499 was offered H5927 (8717) upon the altar H4196 [that was] built H1129 (8803).
006:029 And they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, Who hath done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697? And when they enquired H1875 (8799) and asked H1245 (8762), they said H0559 (8799), Gideon H1439 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 hath done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697.
006:030 Then the men H0582 of the city H5892 said H0559 (8799) unto Joash H3101, Bring out H3318 (8685) thy son H1121, that he may die H4191 (8799): because he hath cast down H5422 (8804) the altar H4196 of Baal H1168, and because he hath cut down H3772 (8804) the grove H0842 that [was] by it.
006:031 And Joash H3101 said H0559 (8799) unto all that stood H5975 (8804) against him, Will ye plead H7378 (8799) for Baal H1168? will ye save H3467 (8686) him? he that will plead H7378 (8799) for him, let him be put to death H4191 (8714) whilst [it is yet] morning H1242: if he [be] a god H0430, let him plead H7378 (8799) for himself, because [one] hath cast down H5422 (8804) his altar H4196.
006:032 Therefore on that day H3117 he called H7121 (8799) him Jerubbaal H3378, saying H0559 (8800), Let Baal H1168 plead H7378 (8799) against him, because he hath thrown down H5422 (8804) his altar H4196.
006:033 Then all the Midianites H4080 and the Amalekites H6002 and the children H1121 of the east H6924 were gathered H0622 (8738) together H3162, and went over H5674 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in the valley H6010 of Jezreel H3157.
006:034 But the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came H3847 (8804) upon Gideon H1439, and he blew H8628 (8799) a trumpet H7782; and Abiezer H0044 was gathered H2199 (8735) after H0310 him.
006:035 And he sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 throughout all Manasseh H4519; who also was gathered H2199 (8735) after H0310 him: and he sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 unto Asher H0836, and unto Zebulun H2074, and unto Naphtali H5321; and they came up H5927 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them.
006:036 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, If thou wilt H3426 save H3467 (8688) Israel H3478 by mine hand H3027, as thou hast said H1696 (8765),
006:037 Behold, I will put H3322 (8688) a fleece H1492 of wool H6785 in the floor H1637; [and] if the dew H2919 be on the fleece H1492 only, and [it be] dry H2721 upon all the earth H0776 [beside], then shall I know H3045 (8804) that thou wilt save H3467 (8686) Israel H3478 by mine hand H3027, as thou hast said H1696 (8765).
006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early H7925 (8686) on the morrow H4283, and thrust H2115 the fleece H1492 together H2115 (8799), and wringed H4680 (8799) the dew H2919 out of the fleece H1492, a bowl H5602 full H4393 of water H4325.
006:039 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, Let not thine anger H0639 be hot H2734 (8799) against me, and I will speak H1696 (8762) but this once H6471: let me prove H5254 (8762), I pray thee, but this once H6471 with the fleece H1492; let it now be dry H2721 only upon the fleece H1492, and upon all the ground H0776 let there be dew H2919.
006:040 And God H0430 did H6213 (8799) so that night H3915: for it was dry H2721 upon the fleece H1492 only, and there was dew H2919 on all the ground H0776.
007:001 ¶ Then Jerubbaal H3378, who [is] Gideon H1439, and all the people H5971 that [were] with him, rose up early H7925 (8686), and pitched H2583 (8799) beside the well of Harod H5878: so that the host H4264 of the Midianites H4080 were on the north side H6828 of them, by the hill H1389 of Moreh H4176, in the valley H6010.
007:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Gideon H1439, The people H5971 that [are] with thee [are] too many H7227 for me to give H5414 (8800) the Midianites H4080 into their hands H3027, lest Israel H3478 vaunt H6286 (8691) themselves against me, saying H0559 (8800), Mine own hand H3027 hath saved H3467 (8689) me.
007:003 Now therefore go to H4994, proclaim H7121 (8798) in the ears H0241 of the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Whosoever [is] fearful H3373 and afraid H2730, let him return H7725 (8799) and depart early H6852 (8799) from mount H2022 Gilead H1568. And there returned H7725 (8799) of the people H5971 twenty H6242 and two H8147 thousand H0505; and there remained H7604 (8738) ten H6235 thousand H0505.
007:004 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Gideon H1439, The people H5971 [are] yet [too] many H7227; bring them down H3381 (8685) unto the water H4325, and I will try H6884 (8799) them for thee there: and it shall be, [that] of whom I say H0559 (8799) unto thee, This shall go H3212 (8799) with thee, the same shall go H3212 (8799) with thee; and of whomsoever I say H0559 (8799) unto thee, This shall not go H3212 (8799) with thee, the same shall not go H3212 (8799).
007:005 So he brought down H3381 (8686) the people H5971 unto the water H4325: and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Gideon H1439, Every one that lappeth H3952 (8799) of the water H4325 with his tongue H3956, as a dog H3611 lappeth H3952 (8799), him shalt thou set H3322 (8686) by himself; likewise every one that boweth down H3766 (8799) upon his knees H1290 to drink H8354 (8800).
007:006 And the number H4557 of them that lapped H3952 (8764), [putting] their hand H3027 to their mouth H6310, were three H7969 hundred H3967 men H0376: but all the rest H3499 of the people H5971 bowed down H3766 (8804) upon their knees H1290 to drink H8354 (8800) water H4325.
007:007 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Gideon H1439, By the three H7969 hundred H3967 men H0376 that lapped H3952 (8764) will I save H3467 (8686) you, and deliver H5414 (8804) the Midianites H4080 into thine hand H3027: and let all the [other] people H5971 go H3212 (8799) every man H0376 unto his place H4725.
007:008 So the people H5971 took H3947 (8799) victuals H6720 in their hand H3027, and their trumpets H7782: and he sent H7971 (8765) all H0376 [the rest of] Israel H3478 every man H0376 unto his tent H0168, and retained H2388 (8689) those three H7969 hundred H3967 men H0376: and the host H4264 of Midian H4080 was beneath him in the valley H6010.
007:009 And it came to pass the same night H3915, that the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Arise H6965 (8798), get thee down H3381 (8798) unto the host H4264; for I have delivered H5414 (8804) it into thine hand H3027.
007:010 But if thou fear H3373 to go down H3381 (8800), go H3381 thou with Phurah H6513 thy servant H5288 down H3381 (8798) to the host H4264:
007:011 And thou shalt hear H8085 (8804) what they say H1696 (8762); and afterward H0310 shall thine hands H3027 be strengthened H2388 (8799) to go down H3381 (8804) unto the host H4264. Then went he down H3381 (8799) with Phurah H6513 his servant H5288 unto the outside H7097 of the armed men H2571 that [were] in the host H4264.
007:012 And the Midianites H4080 and the Amalekites H6002 and all the children H1121 of the east H6924 lay H5307 (8802) along in the valley H6010 like grasshoppers H0697 for multitude H7230; and their camels H1581 [were] without number H4557, as the sand H2344 by the sea H3220 side H8193 for multitude H7230.
007:013 And when Gideon H1439 was come H0935 (8799), behold, [there was] a man H0376 that told H5608 (8764) a dream H2472 unto his fellow H7453, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I dreamed H2492 (8804) a dream H2472, and, lo, a cake H6742 (8675) H6742 of barley H8184 bread H3899 tumbled H2015 (8693) into the host H4264 of Midian H4080, and came H0935 (8799) unto a tent H0168, and smote H5221 (8686) it that it fell H5307 (8799), and overturned H2015 (8799) H4605 it, that the tent H0168 lay along H5307 (8804).
007:014 And his fellow H7453 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), This [is] nothing else save the sword H2719 of Gideon H1439 the son H1121 of Joash H3101, a man H0376 of Israel H3478: [for] into his hand H3027 hath God H0430 delivered H5414 (8804) Midian H4080, and all the host H4264.
007:015 And it was [so], when Gideon H1439 heard H8085 (8800) the telling H4557 of the dream H2472, and the interpretation H7667 thereof, that he worshipped H7812 (8691), and returned H7725 (8799) into the host H4264 of Israel H3478, and said H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798); for the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) into your hand H3027 the host H4264 of Midian H4080.
007:016 And he divided H2673 (8799) the three H7969 hundred H3967 men H0376 [into] three H7969 companies H7218, and he put H5414 (8799) a trumpet H7782 in every man’s hand H3027, with empty H7386 pitchers H3537, and lamps H3940 within H8432 the pitchers H3537.
007:017 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Look H7200 (8799) on me, and do H6213 (8799) likewise: and, behold, when I come H0935 (8802) to the outside H7097 of the camp H4264, it shall be [that], as I do H6213 (8799), so shall ye do H6213 (8799).
007:018 When I blow H8628 (8804) with a trumpet H7782, I and all that [are] with me, then blow H8628 (8804) ye the trumpets H7782 also on every side H5439 of all the camp H4264, and say H0559 (8804), [The sword] of the LORD H3068, and of Gideon H1439.
007:019 So Gideon H1439, and the hundred H3967 men H0376 that [were] with him, came H0935 (8799) unto the outside H7097 of the camp H4264 in the beginning H7218 of the middle H8484 watch H0821; and they had but H0389 newly H6965 (8687) set H6965 (8689) the watch H8104 (8802): and they blew H8628 (8799) the trumpets H7782, and brake H5310 (8800) the pitchers H3537 that [were] in their hands H3027.
007:020 And the three H7969 companies H7218 blew H8628 (8799) the trumpets H7782, and brake H7665 (8799) the pitchers H3537, and held H2388 (8686) the lamps H3940 in their left H8040 hands H3027, and the trumpets H7782 in their right H3225 hands H3027 to blow H8628 (8800) [withal]: and they cried H7121 (8799), The sword H2719 of the LORD H3068, and of Gideon H1439.
007:021 And they stood H5975 (8799) every man H0376 in his place round about H5439 the camp H4264: and all the host H4264 ran H7323 (8799), and cried H7321 (8686), and fled H5127 (8799) (8675) H5127 (8686).
007:022 And the three H7969 hundred H3967 blew H8628 (8799) the trumpets H7782, and the LORD H3068 set H7760 (8799) every man’s H0376 sword H2719 against his fellow H7453, even throughout all the host H4264: and the host H4264 fled H5127 (8799) to Bethshittah H1029 in Zererath H6888, [and] to the border H8193 of Abelmeholah H0065, unto Tabbath H2888.
007:023 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 gathered themselves together H6817 (8735) out of Naphtali H5321, and out of Asher H0836, and out of all Manasseh H4519, and pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 the Midianites H4080.
007:024 And Gideon H1439 sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 throughout all mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, saying H0559 (8800), Come down H3381 (8798) against H7125 (8800) the Midianites H4080, and take H3920 (8798) before them the waters H4325 unto Bethbarah H1012 and Jordan H3383. Then all the men H0376 of Ephraim H0669 gathered themselves together H6817 (8735), and took H3920 (8799) the waters H4325 unto Bethbarah H1012 and Jordan H3383.
007:025 And they took H3920 (8799) two H8147 princes H8269 of the Midianites H4080, Oreb H6159 and Zeeb H2062; and they slew H2026 (8799) Oreb H6159 upon the rock H6697 Oreb H6159, and Zeeb H2062 they slew H2026 (8804) at the winepress H3342 of Zeeb H2062, and pursued H7291 (8799) Midian H4080, and brought H0935 (8689) the heads H7218 of Oreb H6159 and Zeeb H2062 to Gideon H1439 on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383.
008:001 ¶ And the men H0376 of Ephraim H0669 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why hast thou H4100 served H6213 (8804) us thus H1697, that thou calledst H7121 (8800) us not, when thou wentest H1980 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) with the Midianites H4080? And they did chide H7378 (8799) with him sharply H2394.
008:002 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, What have I done H6213 (8804) now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaning H5955 of the grapes of Ephraim H0669 better H2896 than the vintage H1210 of Abiezer H0044?
008:003 God H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) into your hands H3027 the princes H8269 of Midian H4080, Oreb H6159 and Zeeb H2062: and what was I able H3201 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) in comparison of you? Then their anger H7307 was abated H7503 (8804) toward him, when he had said H1697 that H1696 (8763).
008:004 And Gideon H1439 came H0935 (8799) to Jordan H3383, [and] passed over H5674 (8802), he, and the three H7969 hundred H3967 men H0376 that [were] with him, faint H5889, yet pursuing H7291 (8802) [them].
008:005 And he said H0559 (8799) unto the men H0582 of Succoth H5523, Give H5414 (8798), I pray you, loaves H3603 of bread H3899 unto the people H5971 that follow H7272 me; for they [be] faint H5889, and I am pursuing H7291 (8802) after H0310 Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759, kings H4428 of Midian H4080.
008:006 And the princes H8269 of Succoth H5523 said H0559 (8799), [Are] the hands H3709 of Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 now in thine hand H3027, that we should give H5414 (8799) bread H3899 unto thine army H6635?
008:007 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799), Therefore when the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8800) Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 into mine hand H3027, then I will tear H1758 (8804) your flesh H1320 with the thorns H6975 of the wilderness H4057 and with briers H1303.
008:008 And he went up H5927 (8799) thence to Penuel H6439, and spake H1696 (8762) unto them likewise H2063: and the men H0582 of Penuel H6439 answered H6030 (8799) him as the men H0582 of Succoth H5523 had answered H6030 (8804) [him].
008:009 And he spake H0559 (8799) also unto the men H0582 of Penuel H6439, saying H0559 (8800), When I come again H7725 (8800) in peace H7965, I will break down H5422 (8799) this tower H4026.
008:010 Now Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 [were] in Karkor H7174, and their hosts H4264 with them, about fifteen H2568 H6240 thousand H0505 [men], all that were left H3498 (8737) of all the hosts H4264 of the children H1121 of the east H6924: for there fell H5307 (8802) an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719.
008:011 And Gideon H1439 went up H5927 (8799) by the way H1870 of them that dwelt H7931 (8803) in tents H0168 on the east H6924 of Nobah H5025 and Jogbehah H3011, and smote H5221 (8686) the host H4264: for the host H4264 was secure H0983.
008:012 And when Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 fled H5127 (8799), he pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 them, and took H3920 (8799) the two H8147 kings H4428 of Midian H4080, Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759, and discomfited H2729 (8689) all the host H4264.
008:013 And Gideon H1439 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 returned H7725 (8799) from battle H4421 before H4608 the sun H2775 [was up],
008:014 And caught H3920 (8799) a young man H5288 of the men H0582 of Succoth H5523, and enquired H7592 (8799) of him: and he described H3789 (8799) unto him the princes H8269 of Succoth H5523, and the elders H2205 thereof, [even] threescore and seventeen H7657 H7651 men H0376.
008:015 And he came H0935 (8799) unto the men H0582 of Succoth H5523, and said H0559 (8799), Behold Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759, with whom ye did upbraid H2778 (8765) me, saying H0559 (8800), [Are] the hands H3709 of Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 now in thine hand H3027, that we should give H5414 (8799) bread H3899 unto thy men H0582 [that are] weary H3287?
008:016 And he took H3947 (8799) the elders H2205 of the city H5892, and thorns H6975 of the wilderness H4057 and briers H1303, and with them he taught H3045 (8686) the men H0582 of Succoth H5523.
008:017 And he beat down H5422 (8804) the tower H4026 of Penuel H6439, and slew H2026 (8799) the men H0582 of the city H5892.
008:018 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759, What H0375 manner of men H0582 [were they] whom ye slew H2026 (8804) at Tabor H8396? And they answered H0559 (8799), As thou H3644 [art], so [were] they; each one H0259 resembled H8389 the children H1121 of a king H4428.
008:019 And he said H0559 (8799), They [were] my brethren H0251, [even] the sons H1121 of my mother H0517: [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, if H3863 ye had saved them alive H2421 (8689), I would not slay H2026 (8804) you.
008:020 And he said H0559 (8799) unto Jether H3500 his firstborn H1060, Up H6965 (8798), [and] slay H2026 (8798) them. But the youth H5288 drew H8025 (8804) not his sword H2719: for he feared H3372 (8804), because he [was] yet a youth H5288.
008:021 Then Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759 said H0559 (8799), Rise H6965 (8798) thou, and fall H6293 (8798) upon us: for as the man H0376 [is, so is] his strength H1369. And Gideon H1439 arose H6965 (8799), and slew H2026 (8799) Zebah H2078 and Zalmunna H6759, and took away H3947 (8799) the ornaments H7720 that [were] on their camels H1581 ’ necks H6677.
008:022 Then the men H0376 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Gideon H1439, Rule H4910 (8798) thou over us, both thou, and thy son H1121, and thy son’s H1121 son H1121 also: for thou hast delivered H3467 (8689) us from the hand H3027 of Midian H4080.
008:023 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I will not rule H4910 (8799) over you, neither shall my son H1121 rule H4910 (8799) over you: the LORD H3068 shall rule H4910 (8799) over you.
008:024 And Gideon H1439 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I would desire H7592 (8799) a request H7596 of you, that ye would give H5414 (8798) me every man H0376 the earrings H5141 of his prey H7998. (For they had golden H2091 earrings H5141, because they [were] Ishmaelites H3459.)
008:025 And they answered H0559 (8799), We will willingly H5414 (8800) give H5414 (8799) [them]. And they spread H6566 (8799) a garment H8071, and did cast H7993 (8686) therein every man H0376 the earrings H5141 of his prey H7998.
008:026 And the weight H4948 of the golden H2091 earrings H5141 that he requested H7592 (8804) was a thousand H0505 and seven H7651 hundred H3967 [shekels] of gold H2091; beside ornaments H7720, and collars H5188, and purple H0713 raiment H0899 that [was] on the kings H4428 of Midian H4080, and beside the chains H6060 that [were] about their camels H1581 ’ necks H6677.
008:027 And Gideon H1439 made H6213 (8799) an ephod H0646 thereof, and put H3322 (8686) it in his city H5892, [even] in Ophrah H6084: and all Israel H3478 went thither a whoring H2181 (8799) after H0310 it: which thing became a snare H4170 unto Gideon H1439, and to his house H1004.
008:028 Thus was Midian H4080 subdued H3665 (8735) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, so that they lifted up H5375 (8800) their heads H7218 no more H3254 (8804). And the country H0776 was in quietness H8252 (8799) forty H0705 years H8141 in the days H3117 of Gideon H1439.
008:029 And Jerubbaal H3378 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 went H3212 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in his own house H1004.
008:030 And Gideon H1439 had threescore and ten H7657 sons H1121 of his body H3409 begotten H3318 (8802): for he had many H7227 wives H0802.
008:031 And his concubine H6370 that [was] in Shechem H7927, she also bare H3205 (8804) him a son H1121, whose name H8034 he called H7760 (8799) Abimelech H0040.
008:032 And Gideon H1439 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 died H4191 (8799) in a good H2896 old age H7872, and was buried H6912 (8735) in the sepulchre H6913 of Joash H3101 his father H0001, in Ophrah H6084 of the Abiezrites H0033.
008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon H1439 was dead H4191 (8804), that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 turned again H7725 (8799), and went a whoring H2181 (8799) after H0310 Baalim H1168, and made H7760 (8799) Baalberith H1170 their god H0430.
008:034 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 remembered H2142 (8804) not the LORD H3068 their God H0430, who had delivered H5337 (8688) them out of the hands H3027 of all their enemies H0341 (8802) on every side H5439:
008:035 Neither shewed H6213 (8804) they kindness H2617 to the house H1004 of Jerubbaal H3378, [namely], Gideon H1439, according to all the goodness H2896 which he had shewed H6213 (8804) unto Israel H3478.
009:001 ¶ And Abimelech H0040 the son H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378 went H3212 (8799) to Shechem H7927 unto his mother’s H0517 brethren H0251, and communed H1696 (8762) with them, and with all the family H4940 of the house H1004 of his mother’s H0517 father H0001, saying H0559 (8800),
009:002 Speak H1696 (8761), I pray you, in the ears H0241 of all the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, Whether [is] better H2896 for you, either that all the sons H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378, [which are] threescore and ten H7657 persons H0376, reign H4910 (8800) over you, or that one H0259 reign H4910 (8800) over you? remember H2142 (8804) also that I [am] your bone H6106 and your flesh H1320.
009:003 And his mother’s H0517 brethren H0251 spake H1696 (8762) of him in the ears H0241 of all the men H1167 of Shechem H7927 all these words H1697: and their hearts H3820 inclined H5186 (8799) to follow H0310 Abimelech H0040; for they said H0559 (8804), He [is] our brother H0251.
009:004 And they gave H5414 (8799) him threescore and ten H7657 [pieces] of silver H3701 out of the house H1004 of Baalberith H1170, wherewith Abimelech H0040 hired H7936 (8799) vain H7386 and light H6348 (8802) persons H0582, which followed H3212 (8799) him H0310.
009:005 And he went H0935 (8799) unto his father’s H0001 house H1004 at Ophrah H6084, and slew H2026 (8799) his brethren H0251 the sons H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378, [being] threescore and ten H7657 persons H0376, upon one H0259 stone H0068: notwithstanding yet Jotham H3147 the youngest H6996 son H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378 was left H3498 (8735); for he hid H2244 (8738) himself.
009:006 And all the men H1167 of Shechem H7927 gathered together H0622 (8735), and all the house H1004 of Millo H4407 (8677) H1037, and went H3212 (8799), and made H4427 (8686) Abimelech H0040 king H4428, by the plain H0436 of the pillar H5324 (8716) that [was] in Shechem H7927.
009:007 And when they told H5046 (8686) [it] to Jotham H3147, he went H3212 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) in the top H7218 of mount H2022 Gerizim H1630, and lifted up H5375 (8799) his voice H6963, and cried H7121 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, ye men H1167 of Shechem H7927, that God H0430 may hearken H8085 (8799) unto you.
009:008 The trees H6086 went forth H1980 (8804) (8676) H1980 (8800) [on a time] to anoint H4886 (8800) a king H4428 over them; and they said H0559 (8799) unto the olive tree H2132, Reign H4427 (8798) thou over us.
009:009 But the olive tree H2132 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Should I leave H2308 (8804) my fatness H1880, wherewith by me they honour H3513 (8762) God H0430 and man H0582, and go H1980 (8804) to be promoted H5128 (8800) over the trees H6086?
009:010 And the trees H6086 said H0559 (8799) to the fig tree H8384, Come H3212 (8798) thou, [and] reign H4427 (8798) over us.
009:011 But the fig tree H8384 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Should I forsake H2308 (8804) my sweetness H4987, and my good H2896 fruit H8570, and go H1980 (8804) to be promoted H5128 (8800) over the trees H6086?
009:012 Then said H0559 (8799) the trees H6086 unto the vine H1612, Come H3212 (8798) thou, [and] reign H4427 (8798) over us.
009:013 And the vine H1612 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Should I leave H2308 (8804) my wine H8492, which cheereth H8055 (8764) God H0430 and man H0582, and go H1980 (8804) to be promoted H5128 (8800) over the trees H6086?
009:014 Then said H0559 (8799) all the trees H6086 unto the bramble H0329, Come H3212 (8798) thou, [and] reign H4427 (8798) over us.
009:015 And the bramble H0329 said H0559 (8799) unto the trees H6086, If in truth H0571 ye anoint H4886 (8802) me king H4428 over you, [then] come H0935 (8798) [and] put your trust H2620 (8798) in my shadow H6738: and if not, let fire H0784 come out H3318 (8799) of the bramble H0329, and devour H0398 (8799) the cedars H0730 of Lebanon H3844.
009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done H6213 (8804) truly H0571 and sincerely H8549, in that ye have made Abimelech H0040 king H4427 (8686), and if ye have dealt H6213 (8804) well H2896 with Jerubbaal H3378 and his house H1004, and have done H6213 (8804) unto him according to the deserving H1576 of his hands H3027;
009:017 (For my father H0001 fought H3898 (8738) for you, and adventured H7993 (8686) his life H5315 far H5048, and delivered H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of Midian H4080:
009:018 And ye are risen up H6965 (8804) against my father’s H0001 house H1004 this day H3117, and have slain H2026 (8799) his sons H1121, threescore and ten H7657 persons H0376, upon one H0259 stone H0068, and have made Abimelech H0040, the son H1121 of his maidservant H0519, king H4427 (8686) over the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, because he [is] your brother H0251;)
009:019 If ye then have dealt H6213 (8804) truly H0571 and sincerely H8549 with Jerubbaal H3378 and with his house H1004 this day H3117, [then] rejoice H8055 (8798) ye in Abimelech H0040, and let him also rejoice H8055 (8799) in you:
009:020 But if not, let fire H0784 come out H3318 (8799) from Abimelech H0040, and devour H0398 (8799) the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, and the house H1004 of Millo H4407 (8677) H1037; and let fire H0784 come out H3318 (8799) from the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, and from the house H1004 of Millo H4407 (8676) H1037, and devour H0398 (8799) Abimelech H0040.
009:021 And Jotham H3147 ran away H1272 (8799), and fled H5127 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Beer H0876, and dwelt H3427 (8799) there, for fear H6440 of Abimelech H0040 his brother H0251.
009:022 When Abimelech H0040 had reigned H7786 (8799) three H7969 years H8141 over Israel H3478,
009:023 Then God H0430 sent H7971 (8799) an evil H7451 spirit H7307 between Abimelech H0040 and the men H1167 of Shechem H7927; and the men H1167 of Shechem H7927 dealt treacherously H0898 (8799) with Abimelech H0040:
009:024 That the cruelty H2555 [done] to the threescore and ten H7657 sons H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378 might come H0935 (8800), and their blood H1818 be laid H7760 (8800) upon Abimelech H0040 their brother H0251, which slew H2026 (8804) them; and upon the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, which aided H2388 (8765) H3027 him in the killing H2026 (8800) of his brethren H0251.
009:025 And the men H1167 of Shechem H7927 set H7760 (8799) liers in wait H0693 (8764) for him in the top H7218 of the mountains H2022, and they robbed H1497 (8799) all that came H5674 (8799) along that way H1870 by them: and it was told H5046 (8714) Abimelech H0040.
009:026 And Gaal H1603 the son H1121 of Ebed H5651 came H0935 (8799) with his brethren H0251, and went over H5674 (8799) to Shechem H7927: and the men H1167 of Shechem H7927 put their confidence H0982 (8799) in him.
009:027 And they went out H3318 (8799) into the fields H7704, and gathered H1219 (8799) their vineyards H3754, and trode H1869 (8799) [the grapes], and made H6213 (8799) merry H1974, and went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of their god H0430, and did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and cursed H7043 (8762) Abimelech H0040.
009:028 And Gaal H1603 the son H1121 of Ebed H5651 said H0559 (8799), Who [is] Abimelech H0040, and who [is] Shechem H7927, that we should serve H5647 (8799) him? [is] not [he] the son H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378? and Zebul H2083 his officer H6496? serve H5647 (8798) the men H0582 of Hamor H2544 the father H0001 of Shechem H7927: for why should we serve H5647 (8799) him?
009:029 And would to God this people H5971 were under H5414 (8799) my hand H3027! then would I remove H5493 (8686) Abimelech H0040. And he said H0559 (8799) to Abimelech H0040, Increase H7235 (8761) thine army H6635, and come out H3318 (8798).
009:030 And when Zebul H2083 the ruler H8269 of the city H5892 heard H8085 (8799) the words H1697 of Gaal H1603 the son H1121 of Ebed H5651, his anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799).
009:031 And he sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto Abimelech H0040 privily H8649, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, Gaal H1603 the son H1121 of Ebed H5651 and his brethren H0251 be come H0935 (8802) to Shechem H7927; and, behold, they fortify H6696 (8802) the city H5892 against thee.
009:032 Now therefore up H6965 (8798) by night H3915, thou and the people H5971 that [is] with thee, and lie in wait H0693 (8798) in the field H7704:
009:033 And it shall be, [that] in the morning H1242, as soon as the sun H8121 is up H2224 (8800), thou shalt rise early H7925 (8686), and set H6584 (8804) upon the city H5892: and, behold, [when] he and the people H5971 that [is] with him come out H3318 (8802) against thee, then mayest thou do H6213 (8804) to them as thou H3027 shalt find occasion H4672 (8799).
009:034 And Abimelech H0040 rose up H6965 (8799), and all the people H5971 that [were] with him, by night H3915, and they laid wait H0693 (8799) against Shechem H7927 in four H0702 companies H7218.
009:035 And Gaal H1603 the son H1121 of Ebed H5651 went out H3318 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) in the entering H6607 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892: and Abimelech H0040 rose up H6965 (8799), and the people H5971 that [were] with him, from lying in wait H3993.
009:036 And when Gaal H1603 saw H7200 (8799) the people H5971, he said H0559 (8799) to Zebul H2083, Behold, there come H3381 people H5971 down H3381 (8802) from the top H7218 of the mountains H2022. And Zebul H2083 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou seest H7200 (8802) the shadow H6738 of the mountains H2022 as [if they were] men H0582.
009:037 And Gaal H1603 spake H1696 (8763) again H3254 (8686) and said H0559 (8799), See there come H3381 people H5971 down H3381 (8802) by the middle H2872 of the land H0776, and another H0259 company H7218 come H0935 (8804) along by H1870 the plain H0436 of Meonenim H6049 (8781).
009:038 Then said H0559 (8799) Zebul H2083 unto him, Where [is] now H0645 thy mouth H6310, wherewith thou saidst H0559 (8799), Who [is] Abimelech H0040, that we should serve H5647 (8799) him? [is] not this the people H5971 that thou hast despised H3988 (8804)? go out H3318 (8798), I pray now H4994, and fight H3898 (8734) with them.
009:039 And Gaal H1603 went out H3318 (8799) before H6440 the men H1167 of Shechem H7927, and fought H3898 (8735) with Abimelech H0040.
009:040 And Abimelech H0040 chased H7291 (8799) him, and he fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 him, and many H7227 were overthrown H5307 (8799) [and] wounded H2491, [even] unto the entering H6607 of the gate H8179.
009:041 And Abimelech H0040 dwelt H3427 (8799) at Arumah H0725: and Zebul H2083 thrust out H1644 (8762) Gaal H1603 and his brethren H0251, that they should not dwell H3427 (8800) in Shechem H7927.
009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that the people H5971 went out H3318 (8799) into the field H7704; and they told H5046 (8686) Abimelech H0040.
009:043 And he took H3947 (8799) the people H5971, and divided H2673 (8799) them into three H7969 companies H7218, and laid wait H0693 (8799) in the field H7704, and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, the people H5971 [were] come forth H3318 (8802) out of the city H5892; and he rose up H6965 (8799) against them, and smote H5221 (8686) them.
009:044 And Abimelech H0040, and the company H7218 that [was] with him, rushed forward H6584 (8804), and stood H5975 (8799) in the entering H6607 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892: and the two H8147 [other] companies H7218 ran upon H6584 (8804) all [the people] that [were] in the fields H7704, and slew H5221 (8686) them.
009:045 And Abimelech H0040 fought H3898 (8738) against the city H5892 all that day H3117; and he took H3920 (8799) the city H5892, and slew H2026 (8804) the people H5971 that [was] therein, and beat down H5422 (8799) the city H5892, and sowed H2232 (8799) it with salt H4417.
009:046 And when all the men H1167 of the tower H4026 of Shechem H7927 heard H8085 (8799) [that], they entered H0935 (8799) into an hold H6877 of the house H1004 of the god H0410 Berith H1286.
009:047 And it was told H5046 (8714) Abimelech H0040, that all the men H1167 of the tower H4026 of Shechem H7927 were gathered together H6908 (8694).
009:048 And Abimelech H0040 gat him up H5927 (8799) to mount H2022 Zalmon H6756, he and all the people H5971 that [were] with him; and Abimelech H0040 took H3947 (8799) an axe H7134 in his hand H3027, and cut down H3772 (8799) a bough H7754 from the trees H6086, and took H5375 (8799) it, and laid H7760 (8799) [it] on his shoulder H7926, and said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971 that [were] with him, What ye have seen H7200 (8804) me do H6213 (8804), make haste H4116 (8761), [and] do H6213 (8798) as I H3644 [have done].
009:049 And all the people H5971 likewise cut down H3772 (8799) every man H0376 his bough H7754, and followed H3212 (8799) H0310 Abimelech H0040, and put H7760 (8799) [them] to the hold H6877, and set H3341 (8686) the hold H6877 on fire H0784 upon them; so that all the men H0582 of the tower H4026 of Shechem H7927 died H4191 (8799) also, about a thousand H0505 men H0376 and women H0802.
009:050 Then went H3212 (8799) Abimelech H0040 to Thebez H8405, and encamped H2583 (8799) against Thebez H8405, and took H3920 (8799) it.
009:051 But there was a strong H5797 tower H4026 within H8432 the city H5892, and thither fled H5127 (8799) all the men H0582 and women H0802, and all they H1167 of the city H5892, and shut H5462 (8799) [it] to them, and gat them up H5927 (8799) to the top H1406 of the tower H4026.
009:052 And Abimelech H0040 came H0935 (8799) unto the tower H4026, and fought H3898 (8735) against it, and went hard H5066 (8799) unto the door H6607 of the tower H4026 to burn H8313 (8800) it with fire H0784.
009:053 And a certain H0259 woman H0802 cast H7993 (8686) a piece H6400 of a millstone H7393 upon Abimelech’s H0040 head H7218, and all to brake H7533 (8686) his skull H1538.
009:054 Then he called H7121 (8799) hastily H4120 unto the young man H5288 his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Draw H8025 (8798) thy sword H2719, and slay H4191 (8786) me, that men say H0559 (8799) not of me, A woman H0802 slew H2026 (8804) him. And his young man H5288 thrust him through H1856 (8799), and he died H4191 (8799).
009:055 And when the men H0376 of Israel H3478 saw H7200 (8799) that Abimelech H0040 was dead H4191 (8804), they departed H3212 (8799) every man H0376 unto his place H4725.
009:056 Thus God H0430 rendered H7725 (8686) the wickedness H7451 of Abimelech H0040, which he did H6213 (8804) unto his father H0001, in slaying H2026 (8800) his seventy H7657 brethren H0251:
009:057 And all the evil H7451 of the men H0582 of Shechem H7927 did God H0430 render H7725 (8689) upon their heads H7218: and upon them came H0935 (8799) the curse H7045 of Jotham H3147 the son H1121 of Jerubbaal H3378.
010:001 ¶ And after H0310 Abimelech H0040 there arose H6965 (8799) to defend H3467 (8687) Israel H3478 Tola H8439 the son H1121 of Puah H6312, the son H1121 of Dodo H1734, a man H0376 of Issachar H3485; and he dwelt H3427 (8802) in Shamir H8069 in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669.
010:002 And he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 twenty H6242 and three H7969 years H8141, and died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in Shamir H8069.
010:003 And after H0310 him arose H6965 (8799) Jair H2971, a Gileadite H1569, and judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 twenty H6242 and two H8147 years H8141.
010:004 And he had thirty H7970 sons H1121 that rode H7392 (8802) on thirty H7970 ass colts H5895, and they had thirty H7970 cities H5892, which are called H7121 (8799) Havothjair H2334 unto this day H3117, which [are] in the land H0776 of Gilead H1568.
010:005 And Jair H2971 died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in Camon H7056.
010:006 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8800) evil H7451 again H3254 (8686) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8799) Baalim H1168, and Ashtaroth H6252, and the gods H0430 of Syria H0758, and the gods H0430 of Zidon H6721, and the gods H0430 of Moab H4124, and the gods H0430 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and the gods H0430 of the Philistines H6430, and forsook H5800 (8799) the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8804) not him.
010:007 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was hot H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478, and he sold H4376 (8799) them into the hands H3027 of the Philistines H6430, and into the hands H3027 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
010:008 And that year H8141 they vexed H7492 (8799) and oppressed H7533 (8779) the children H1121 of Israel H3478: eighteen H8083 H6240 years H8141, all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 that [were] on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383 in the land H0776 of the Amorites H0567, which [is] in Gilead H1568.
010:009 Moreover the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383 to fight H3898 (8736) also against Judah H3063, and against Benjamin H1144, and against the house H1004 of Ephraim H0669; so that Israel H3478 was sore H3966 distressed H3334 (8799).
010:010 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), We have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee, both because we have forsaken H5800 (8804) our God H0430, and also served H5647 (8799) Baalim H1168.
010:011 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians H4714, and from the Amorites H0567, from the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and from the Philistines H6430?
010:012 The Zidonians H6722 also, and the Amalekites H6002, and the Maonites H4584, did oppress H3905 (8804) you; and ye cried H6817 (8799) to me, and I delivered H3467 (8686) you out of their hand H3027.
010:013 Yet ye have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and served H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430: wherefore I will deliver H3467 (8687) you no more H3254 (8686).
010:014 Go H3212 (8798) and cry H2199 (8798) unto the gods H0430 which ye have chosen H0977 (8804); let them H1992 deliver H3467 (8686) you in the time H6256 of your tribulation H6869.
010:015 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, We have sinned H2398 (8804): do H6213 (8798) thou unto us whatsoever seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto thee; deliver H5337 (8685) us only, we pray thee, this day H3117.
010:016 And they put away H5493 (8686) the strange H5236 gods H0430 from among H7130 them, and served H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068: and his soul H5315 was grieved H7114 (8799) for the misery H5999 of Israel H3478.
010:017 Then the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 were gathered together H6817 (8735), and encamped H2583 (8799) in Gilead H1568. And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 assembled themselves together H0622 (8735), and encamped H2583 (8799) in Mizpeh H4709.
010:018 And the people H5971 [and] princes H8269 of Gilead H1568 said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, What man H0376 [is he] that will begin H2490 (8686) to fight H3898 (8736) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983? he shall be head H7218 over all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gilead H1568.
011:001 ¶ Now Jephthah H3316 the Gileadite H1569 was a mighty man H1368 of valour H2428, and he [was] the son H1121 of an harlot H0802 H2181 (8802): and Gilead H1568 begat H3205 (8686) Jephthah H3316.
011:002 And Gilead’s H1568 wife H0802 bare H3205 (8799) him sons H1121; and his wife’s H0802 sons H1121 grew up H1431 (8799), and they thrust out H1644 (8762) Jephthah H3316, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou shalt not inherit H5157 (8799) in our father’s H0001 house H1004; for thou [art] the son H1121 of a strange H0312 woman H0802.
011:003 Then Jephthah H3316 fled H1272 (8799) from H6440 his brethren H0251, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of Tob H2897: and there were gathered H3950 (8691) vain H7386 men H0582 to Jephthah H3316, and went out H3318 (8799) with him.
011:004 And it came to pass in process of time H3117, that the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 made war H3898 (8735) against Israel H3478.
011:005 And it was so, that when the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 made war H3898 (8738) against Israel H3478, the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568 went H3212 (8799) to fetch H3947 (8800) Jephthah H3316 out of the land H0776 of Tob H2897:
011:006 And they said H0559 (8799) unto Jephthah H3316, Come H3212 (8798), and be our captain H7101, that we may fight H3898 (8735) with the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
011:007 And Jephthah H3316 said H0559 (8799) unto the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568, Did not ye hate H8130 (8804) me, and expel H1644 (8762) me out of my father’s H0001 house H1004? and why are ye come H0935 (8804) unto me now when ye are in distress H6887 (8804)?
011:008 And the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568 said H0559 (8799) unto Jephthah H3316, Therefore we turn again H7725 (8804) to thee now, that thou mayest go H1980 (8804) with us, and fight H3898 (8738) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and be our head H7218 over all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gilead H1568.
011:009 And Jephthah H3316 said H0559 (8799) unto the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568, If ye bring me home again H7725 (8688) to fight H3898 (8736) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and the LORD H3068 deliver H5414 (8804) them before H6440 me, shall I be your head H7218?
011:010 And the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568 said H0559 (8799) unto Jephthah H3316, The LORD H3068 be witness H8085 (8802) between us, if we do H6213 (8799) not so according to thy words H1697.
011:011 Then Jephthah H3316 went H3212 (8799) with the elders H2205 of Gilead H1568, and the people H5971 made H7760 (8799) him head H7218 and captain H7101 over them: and Jephthah H3316 uttered H1696 (8762) all his words H1697 before H6440 the LORD H3068 in Mizpeh H4709.
011:012 And Jephthah H3316 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, saying H0559 (8800), What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come H0935 (8804) against me to fight H3898 (8736) in my land H0776?
011:013 And the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 answered H0559 (8799) unto the messengers H4397 of Jephthah H3316, Because Israel H3478 took away H3947 (8804) my land H0776, when they came up H5927 (8800) out of Egypt H4714, from Arnon H0769 even unto Jabbok H2999, and unto Jordan H3383: now therefore restore those [lands] again H7725 (8685) peaceably H7965.
011:014 And Jephthah H3316 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 again H3254 (8686) unto the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983:
011:015 And said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) Jephthah H3316, Israel H3478 took not away H3947 (8804) the land H0776 of Moab H4124, nor the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983:
011:016 But when Israel H3478 came up H5927 (8800) from Egypt H4714, and walked H3212 (8799) through the wilderness H4057 unto the Red H5488 sea H3220, and came H0935 (8799) to Kadesh H6946;
011:017 Then Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto the king H4428 of Edom H0123, saying H0559 (8800), Let me, I pray thee, pass through H5674 (8799) thy land H0776: but the king H4428 of Edom H0123 would not hearken H8085 (8804) [thereto]. And in like manner they sent H7971 (8804) unto the king H4428 of Moab H4124: but he would H0014 (8804) not [consent]: and Israel H3478 abode H3427 (8799) in Kadesh H6946.
011:018 Then they went along H3212 (8799) through the wilderness H4057, and compassed H5437 (8799) the land H0776 of Edom H0123, and the land H0776 of Moab H4124, and came H0935 (8799) by the east side H4217 H8121 of the land H0776 of Moab H4124, and pitched H2583 (8799) on the other side H5676 of Arnon H0769, but came H0935 (8804) not within the border H1366 of Moab H4124: for Arnon H0769 [was] the border H1366 of Moab H4124.
011:019 And Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, the king H4428 of Heshbon H2809; and Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Let us pass H5674 (8799), we pray thee, through thy land H0776 into H5704 my place H4725.
011:020 But Sihon H5511 trusted H0539 (8689) not Israel H3478 to pass H5674 (8800) through his coast H1366: but Sihon H5511 gathered H0622 all his people H5971 together H0622 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in Jahaz H3096, and fought H3898 (8735) against Israel H3478.
011:021 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 delivered H5414 (8799) Sihon H5511 and all his people H5971 into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478, and they smote H5221 (8686) them: so Israel H3478 possessed H3423 (8799) all the land H0776 of the Amorites H0567, the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of that country H0776.
011:022 And they possessed H3423 (8799) all the coasts H1366 of the Amorites H0567, from Arnon H0769 even unto Jabbok H2999, and from the wilderness H4057 even unto Jordan H3383.
011:023 So now the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 hath dispossessed H3423 (8689) the Amorites H0567 from before H6440 his people H5971 Israel H3478, and shouldest thou possess H3423 (8799) it?
011:024 Wilt not thou possess H3423 (8799) that which Chemosh H3645 thy god H0430 giveth thee to possess H3423 (8686)? So whomsoever the LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall drive out H3423 (8689) from before H6440 us, them will we possess H3423 (8799).
011:025 And now [art] thou any thing better H2896 than Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834, king H4428 of Moab H4124? did he ever H7378 (8800) strive H7378 (8804) against Israel H3478, or did he ever H3898 (8736) fight H3898 (8738) against them,
011:026 While Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8800) in Heshbon H2809 and her towns H1323, and in Aroer H6177 and her towns H1323, and in all the cities H5892 that [be] along by the coasts H3027 of Arnon H0769, three H7969 hundred H3967 years H8141? why therefore did ye not recover H5337 (8689) [them] within that time H6256?
011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned H2398 (8804) against thee, but thou doest H6213 (8802) H0853 me wrong H7451 to war H3898 (8736) against me: the LORD H3068 the Judge H8199 (8802) be judge H8199 (8799) this day H3117 between the children H1121 of Israel H3478 and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
011:028 Howbeit the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto the words H1697 of Jephthah H3316 which he sent H7971 (8804) him.
011:029 Then the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came upon Jephthah H3316, and he passed over H5674 (8799) Gilead H1568, and Manasseh H4519, and passed over H5674 (8799) Mizpeh H4708 of Gilead H1568, and from Mizpeh H4708 of Gilead H1568 he passed over H5674 (8804) [unto] the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
011:030 And Jephthah H3316 vowed H5087 (8799) a vow H5088 unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), If thou shalt without fail H5414 (8800) deliver H5414 (8799) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 into mine hands H3027,
011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever H3318 (8802) cometh forth H3318 (8799) of the doors H1817 of my house H1004 to meet H7125 (8800) me, when I return H7725 (8800) in peace H7965 from the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, shall surely be the LORD’S H3068, and I will offer it up H5927 (8689) for a burnt offering H5930.
011:032 So Jephthah H3316 passed over H5674 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 to fight H3898 (8736) against them; and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) them into his hands H3027.
011:033 And he smote H5221 (8686) them from Aroer H6177, even till thou come H0935 (8800) to Minnith H4511, [even] twenty H6242 cities H5892, and unto the plain H0058 of the vineyards H3754 (8677) H0064, with a very H3966 great H1419 slaughter H4347. Thus the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 were subdued H3665 (8735) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
011:034 And Jephthah H3316 came H0935 (8799) to Mizpeh H4709 unto his house H1004, and, behold, his daughter H1323 came out H3318 (8802) to meet H7125 (8800) him with timbrels H8596 and with dances H4246: and she [was his] only child H3173; beside her he had neither son H1121 nor H0176 daughter H1323.
011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw H7200 (8800) her, that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899, and said H0559 (8799), Alas H0162, my daughter H1323! thou hast brought H3766 me very H3766 (8689) low H3766 (8687), and thou art one of them that trouble H5916 (8802) me: for I have opened H6475 (8804) my mouth H6310 unto the LORD H3068, and I cannot H3201 (8799) go back H7725 (8800).
011:036 And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, My father H0001, [if] thou hast opened H6475 (8804) thy mouth H6310 unto the LORD H3068, do H6213 (8798) to me according to that which H0834 hath proceeded H3318 (8804) out of thy mouth H6310; forasmuch H0310 as the LORD H3068 hath taken H6213 (8804) vengeance H5360 for thee of thine enemies H0341 (8802), [even] of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
011:037 And she said H0559 (8799) unto her father H0001, Let this thing H1697 be done H6213 (8735) for me: let me alone H7503 (8685) two H8147 months H2320, that I may go up H3212 (8799) and down H3381 (8804) upon the mountains H2022, and bewail H1058 (8799) my virginity H1331, I and my fellows H7464 (8675) H7474.
011:038 And he said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798). And he sent her away H7971 (8799) [for] two H8147 months H2320: and she went H3212 (8799) with her companions H7464, and bewailed H1058 (8799) her virginity H1331 upon the mountains H2022.
011:039 And it came to pass at the end H7093 of two H8147 months H2320, that she returned H7725 (8799) unto her father H0001, who did H6213 (8799) with her [according] to his vow H5088 which he had vowed H5087 (8804): and she knew H3045 (8804) no man H0376. And it was a custom H2706 in Israel H3478,
011:040 [That] the daughters H1323 of Israel H3478 went H3212 (8799) yearly H3117 H3117 to lament H8567 (8763) the daughter H1323 of Jephthah H3316 the Gileadite H1569 four H0702 days H3117 in a year H8141.
012:001 ¶ And the men H0376 of Ephraim H0669 gathered themselves together H6817 (8735), and went H5674 (8799) northward H6828, and said H0559 (8799) unto Jephthah H3316, Wherefore passedst thou over H5674 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and didst not call H7121 (8804) us to go H3212 (8800) with thee? we will burn H8313 (8799) thine house H1004 upon thee with fire H0784.
012:002 And Jephthah H3316 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I and my people H5971 were H1961 (8804) at great H3966 strife H0376 H7379 with the children H1121 of Ammon H5983; and when I called H2199 (8799) you, ye delivered H3467 (8689) me not out of their hands H3027.
012:003 And when I saw H7200 (8799) that ye delivered H3467 (8688) [me] not, I put H7760 (8799) my life H5315 in my hands H3709, and passed over H5674 (8799) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) them into my hand H3027: wherefore then are ye come up H5927 (8804) unto me this day H3117, to fight H3898 (8736) against me?
012:004 Then Jephthah H3316 gathered together H6908 (8799) all the men H0582 of Gilead H1568, and fought H3898 (8735) with Ephraim H0669: and the men H0582 of Gilead H1568 smote H5221 (8686) Ephraim H0669, because they said H0559 (8804), Ye Gileadites H1568 [are] fugitives H6412 of Ephraim H0669 among H8432 the Ephraimites H0669, [and] among H8432 the Manassites H4519.
012:005 And the Gileadites H1568 took H3920 (8799) the passages H4569 of Jordan H3383 before the Ephraimites H0669: and it was [so], that when those Ephraimites H0669 which were escaped H6412 said H0559 (8799), Let me go over H5674 (8799); that the men H0582 of Gilead H1568 said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Art] thou an Ephraimite H0673? If he said H0559 (8799), Nay;
012:006 Then said H0559 (8799) they unto him, Say H0559 (8798) now Shibboleth H7641: and he said H0559 (8799) Sibboleth H5451: for he could not frame H3559 to pronounce H1696 (8763) [it] right H3559 (8686). Then they took H0270 (8799) him, and slew H7819 (8799) him at the passages H4569 of Jordan H3383: and there fell H5307 (8799) at that time H6256 of the Ephraimites H0669 forty H0705 and two H8147 thousand H0505.
012:007 And Jephthah H3316 judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 six H8337 years H8141. Then died H4191 (8799) Jephthah H3316 the Gileadite H1569, and was buried H6912 (8735) in [one of] the cities H5892 of Gilead H1568.
012:008 And after H0310 him Ibzan H0078 of Bethlehem H1035 judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478.
012:009 And he had thirty H7970 sons H1121, and thirty H7970 daughters H1323, [whom] he sent H7971 (8765) abroad H2351, and took H0935 (8689) in thirty H7970 daughters H1323 from abroad H2351 for his sons H1121. And he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 seven H7651 years H8141.
012:010 Then died H4191 (8799) Ibzan H0078, and was buried H6912 (8735) at Bethlehem H1035.
012:011 And after H0310 him Elon H0356, a Zebulonite H2075, judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478; and he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 ten H6235 years H8141.
012:012 And Elon H0356 the Zebulonite H2075 died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in Aijalon H0357 in the country H0776 of Zebulun H2074.
012:013 And after H0310 him Abdon H5658 the son H1121 of Hillel H1985, a Pirathonite H6553, judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478.
012:014 And he had forty H0705 sons H1121 and thirty H7970 nephews H1121 H1121, that rode H7392 (8802) on threescore and ten H7657 ass colts H5895: and he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 eight H8083 years H8141.
012:015 And Abdon H5658 the son H1121 of Hillel H1985 the Pirathonite H6553 died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in Pirathon H6552 in the land H0776 of Ephraim H0669, in the mount H2022 of the Amalekites H6003.
013:001 ¶ And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8800) evil H7451 again H3254 (8686) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068; and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430 forty H0705 years H8141.
013:002 And there was a certain H0259 man H0376 of Zorah H6881, of the family H4940 of the Danites H1839, whose name H8034 [was] Manoah H4495; and his wife H0802 [was] barren H6135, and bare H3205 (8804) not.
013:003 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto the woman H0802, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, Behold now, thou [art] barren H6135, and bearest H3205 (8804) not: but thou shalt conceive H2029 (8804), and bear H3205 (8804) a son H1121.
013:004 Now therefore beware H8104 (8734), I pray thee, and drink H8354 (8799) not wine H3196 nor strong drink H7941, and eat H0398 (8799) not any unclean H2931 [thing]:
013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive H2030, and bear H3205 (8802) a son H1121; and no razor H4177 shall come H5927 (8799) on his head H7218: for the child H5288 shall be a Nazarite H5139 unto God H0430 from the womb H0990: and he shall begin H2490 (8686) to deliver H3467 (8687) Israel H3478 out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
013:006 Then the woman H0802 came H0935 (8799) and told H0559 (8799) her husband H0376, saying H0559 (8800), A man H0376 of God H0430 came H0935 (8804) unto me, and his countenance H4758 [was] like the countenance H4758 of an angel H4397 of God H0430, very H3966 terrible H3372 (8737): but I asked H7592 (8804) him not whence he [was], neither told H5046 (8689) he me his name H8034:
013:007 But he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive H2030, and bear H3205 (8802) a son H1121; and now drink H7941 no wine H3196 nor strong drink H8354 (8799), neither eat H0398 (8799) any unclean H2932 [thing]: for the child H5288 shall be a Nazarite H5139 to God H0430 from the womb H0990 to the day H3117 of his death H4194.
013:008 Then Manoah H4495 intreated H6279 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), O H0994 my Lord H0136, let H4994 the man H0376 of God H0430 which thou didst send H7971 (8804) come again H0935 (8799) unto us, and teach H3384 (8686) us what we shall do H6213 (8799) unto the child H5288 that shall be born H3205 (8795).
013:009 And God H0430 hearkened H8085 (8799) to the voice H6963 of Manoah H4495; and the angel H4397 of God H0430 came again H0935 (8799) unto the woman H0802 as she sat H3427 (8802) in the field H7704: but Manoah H4495 her husband H0376 [was] not with her.
013:010 And the woman H0802 made haste H4116 (8762), and ran H7323 (8799), and shewed H5046 (8686) her husband H0376, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, the man H0376 hath appeared H7200 (8738) unto me, that came H0935 (8804) unto me the [other] day H3117.
013:011 And Manoah H4495 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) after H0310 his wife H0802, and came H0935 (8799) to the man H0376, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Art] thou the man H0376 that spakest H1696 (8765) unto the woman H0802? And he said H0559 (8799), I [am].
013:012 And Manoah H4495 said H0559 (8799), Now let thy words H1697 come to pass H0935 (8799). How shall we order H4941 the child H5288, and [how] shall we do H4639 unto him?
013:013 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Manoah H4495, Of all that I said H0559 (8804) unto the woman H0802 let her beware H8104 (8735).
013:014 She may not eat H0398 (8799) of any [thing] that cometh H3318 (8799) of the vine H1612, neither let her drink H8354 (8799) wine H3196 or strong drink H7941, nor eat H0398 (8799) any unclean H2932 [thing]: all that I commanded H6680 (8765) her let her observe H8104 (8799).
013:015 And Manoah H4495 said H0559 (8799) unto the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, I pray thee, let us detain H6113 (8799) thee, until we shall have made ready H6213 (8799) a kid H1423 H5795 for H6440 thee.
013:016 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Manoah H4495, Though thou detain H6113 (8799) me, I will not eat H0398 (8799) of thy bread H3899: and if H0518 thou wilt offer H6213 (8799) a burnt offering H5930, thou must offer H5927 (8686) it unto the LORD H3068. For Manoah H4495 knew H3045 (8804) not that he [was] an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068.
013:017 And Manoah H4495 said H0559 (8799) unto the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, What [is] thy name H8034, that when thy sayings H1697 come to pass H0935 (8799) we may do thee honour H3513 (8765)?
013:018 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why askest H7592 (8799) thou thus after my name H8034, seeing it [is] secret H6383 (8675) H6383?
013:019 So Manoah H4495 took H3947 (8799) a kid H1423 H5795 with a meat offering H4503, and offered H5927 (8799) [it] upon a rock H6697 unto the LORD H3068: and [the angel] did H6213 (8800) wondrously H6381 (8688); and Manoah H4495 and his wife H0802 looked on H7200 (8802).
013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame H3851 went up H5927 (8800) toward heaven H8064 from off the altar H4196, that the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 ascended H5927 (8799) in the flame H3851 of the altar H4196. And Manoah H4495 and his wife H0802 looked on H7200 (8802) [it], and fell on H5307 (8799) their faces H6440 to the ground H0776.
013:021 But the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 did no more H3254 (8804) appear H7200 (8736) to Manoah H4495 and to his wife H0802. Then Manoah H4495 knew H3045 (8804) that he [was] an angel H4397 of the LORD H3068.
013:022 And Manoah H4495 said H0559 (8799) unto his wife H0802, We shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799), because we have seen H7200 (8804) God H0430.
013:023 But his wife H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto him, If H3863 the LORD H3068 were pleased H2654 (8804) to kill H4191 (8687) us, he would not have received H3947 (8804) a burnt offering H5930 and a meat offering H4503 at our hands H3027, neither would he have shewed H7200 (8689) us all these [things], nor would as at this time H6256 have told H8085 (8689) us [such things] as these H2063.
013:024 And the woman H0802 bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Samson H8123: and the child H5288 grew H1431 (8799), and the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8762) him.
013:025 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 began H2490 (8686) to move him at times H6470 (8800) in the camp H4264 of Dan H1835 between Zorah H6881 and Eshtaol H0847.
014:001 ¶ And Samson H8123 went down H3381 (8799) to Timnath H8553, and saw H7200 (8799) a woman H0802 in Timnath H8553 of the daughters H1323 of the Philistines H6430.
014:002 And he came up H5927 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) his father H0001 and his mother H0517, and said H0559 (8799), I have seen H7200 (8804) a woman H0802 in Timnath H8553 of the daughters H1323 of the Philistines H6430: now therefore get H3947 (8798) her for me to wife H0802.
014:003 Then his father H0001 and his mother H0517 said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Is there] never H0369 a woman H0802 among the daughters H1323 of thy brethren H0251, or among all my people H5971, that thou goest H1980 (8802) to take H3947 (8800) a wife H0802 of the uncircumcised H6189 Philistines H6430? And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, Get H3947 (8798) her for me; for she pleaseth me well H3474 (8804) H5869.
014:004 But his father H0001 and his mother H0517 knew H3045 (8804) not that it [was] of the LORD H3068, that he sought H1245 (8764) an occasion H8385 against the Philistines H6430: for at that time H6256 the Philistines H6430 had dominion H4910 (8802) over Israel H3478.
014:005 Then went H3381 Samson H8123 down H3381 (8799), and his father H0001 and his mother H0517, to Timnath H8553, and came H0935 (8799) to the vineyards H3754 of Timnath H8553: and, behold, a young H3715 lion H0738 roared H7580 (8802) against H7125 (8800) him.
014:006 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came mightily H6743 (8799) upon him, and he rent H8156 (8762) him as he would have rent H8156 (8763) a kid H1423, and [he had] nothing H3972 in his hand H3027: but he told H5046 (8689) not his father H0001 or his mother H0517 what he had done H6213 (8804).
014:007 And he went down H3381 (8799), and talked H1696 (8762) with the woman H0802; and she pleased H3474 Samson H8123 well H3474 (8799) H5869.
014:008 And after a time H3117 he returned H7725 (8799) to take H3947 (8800) her, and he turned aside H5493 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) the carcase H4658 of the lion H0738: and, behold, [there was] a swarm H5712 of bees H1682 and honey H1706 in the carcase H1472 of the lion H0738.
014:009 And he took H7287 (8799) thereof in his hands H3709, and went on H3212 (8799) eating H0398 (8800), and came H1980 (8800) to his father H0001 and mother H0517, and he gave H5414 (8799) them, and they did eat H0398 (8799): but he told H5046 (8689) not them that he had taken H7287 (8804) the honey H1706 out of the carcase H1472 of the lion H0738.
014:010 So his father H0001 went down H3381 (8799) unto the woman H0802: and Samson H8123 made H6213 (8799) there a feast H4960; for so used the young men H0970 to do H6213 (8799).
014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw H7200 (8800) him, that they brought H3947 (8799) thirty H7970 companions H4828 to be with him.
014:012 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I will now put forth H2330 (8799) a riddle H2420 unto you: if ye can certainly H5046 (8687) declare H5046 (8686) it me within the seven H7651 days H3117 of the feast H4960, and find [it] out H4672 (8804), then I will give H5414 (8804) you thirty H7970 sheets H5466 and thirty H7970 change H2487 of garments H0899:
014:013 But if ye cannot H3201 (8799) declare H5046 (8687) [it] me, then shall ye give H5414 (8804) me thirty H7970 sheets H5466 and thirty H7970 change H2487 of garments H0899. And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Put forth H2330 (8798) thy riddle H2420, that we may hear H8085 (8799) it.
014:014 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Out of the eater H0398 (8802) came forth H3318 (8804) meat H3978, and out of the strong H5794 came forth H3318 (8804) sweetness H4966. And they could H3201 (8804) not in three H7969 days H3117 expound H5046 (8687) the riddle H2420.
014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh H7637 day H3117, that they said H0559 (8799) unto Samson’s H8123 wife H0802, Entice H6601 (8761) thy husband H0376, that he may declare H5046 (8686) unto us the riddle H2420, lest we burn H8313 (8799) thee and thy father’s H0001 house H1004 with fire H0784: have ye called H7121 (8804) us to take that we have H3423 (8800)? [is it] not [so]?
014:016 And Samson’s H8123 wife H0802 wept H1058 (8799) before him, and said H0559 (8799), Thou dost but hate H8130 (8804) me, and lovest H0157 (8804) me not: thou hast put forth H2330 (8804) a riddle H2420 unto the children H1121 of my people H5971, and hast not told H5046 (8689) [it] me. And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, Behold, I have not told H5046 (8689) [it] my father H0001 nor my mother H0517, and shall I tell H5046 (8686) [it] thee?
014:017 And she wept H1058 (8799) before him the seven H7651 days H3117, while their feast H4960 lasted H1961 (8804): and it came to pass on the seventh H7637 day H3117, that he told H5046 (8686) her, because she lay sore H6693 (8689) upon him: and she told H5046 (8686) the riddle H2420 to the children H1121 of her people H5971.
014:018 And the men H0582 of the city H5892 said H0559 (8799) unto him on the seventh H7637 day H3117 before the sun H2775 went down H0935 (8799), What [is] sweeter H4966 than honey H1706? and what [is] stronger H5794 than a lion H0738? And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, If H3884 ye had not plowed H2790 (8804) with my heifer H5697, ye had not found out H4672 (8804) my riddle H2420.
014:019 And the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came H6743 (8799) upon him, and he went down H3381 (8799) to Ashkelon H0831, and slew H5221 (8686) thirty H7970 men H0376 of them, and took H3947 (8799) their spoil H2488, and gave H5414 (8799) change H2487 of garments unto them which expounded H5046 (8688) the riddle H2420. And his anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799), and he went up H5927 (8799) to his father’s H0001 house H1004.
014:020 But Samson’s H8123 wife H0802 was [given] to his companion H4828, whom he had used as his friend H7462 (8765).
015:001 ¶ But it came to pass within a while after H3117, in the time H3117 of wheat H2406 harvest H7105, that Samson H8123 visited H6485 (8799) his wife H0802 with a kid H1423 H5795; and he said H0559 (8799), I will go in H0935 (8799) to my wife H0802 into the chamber H2315. But her father H0001 would not suffer H5414 (8804) him to go in H0935 (8800).
015:002 And her father H0001 said H0559 (8799), I verily H0559 (8800) thought H0559 (8804) that thou hadst utterly H8130 (8800) hated H8130 (8804) her; therefore I gave H5414 (8799) her to thy companion H4828: [is] not her younger H6996 sister H0269 fairer H2896 than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
015:003 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) concerning them, Now H6471 shall I be more blameless H5352 (8738) than the Philistines H6430, though I do H6213 (8802) them a displeasure H7451.
015:004 And Samson H8123 went H3212 (8799) and caught H3920 (8799) three H7969 hundred H3967 foxes H7776, and took H3947 (8799) firebrands H3940, and turned H6437 (8686) tail H2180 to tail H2180, and put H7760 (8799) a H0259 firebrand H3940 in the midst H8432 between two H8147 tails H2180.
015:005 And when he had set H1197 (8686) the brands H3940 on fire H0784, he let [them] go H7971 (8762) into the standing corn H7054 of the Philistines H6430, and burnt up H1197 (8686) both the shocks H1430, and also the standing corn H7054, with the vineyards H3754 [and] olives H2132.
015:006 Then the Philistines H6430 said H0559 (8799), Who hath done H6213 (8804) this? And they answered H0559 (8799), Samson H8123, the son in law H2860 of the Timnite H8554, because he had taken H3947 (8804) his wife H0802, and given H5414 (8799) her to his companion H4828. And the Philistines H6430 came up H5927 (8799), and burnt H8313 (8799) her and her father H0001 with fire H0784.
015:007 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Though H0518 ye have done H6213 (8799) this H2063, yet will I be avenged H5358 (8738) of you, and after H0310 that I will cease H2308 (8799).
015:008 And he smote H5221 (8686) them hip H7785 and H5921 thigh H3409 with a great H1419 slaughter H4347: and he went down H3381 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the top H5585 of the rock H5553 Etam H5862.
015:009 Then the Philistines H6430 went up H5927 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in Judah H3063, and spread H5203 (8735) themselves in Lehi H3896.
015:010 And the men H0376 of Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799), Why are ye come up H5927 (8804) against us? And they answered H0559 (8799), To bind H0631 (8800) Samson H8123 are we come up H5927 (8804), to do H6213 (8800) to him as he hath done H6213 (8804) to us.
015:011 Then three H7969 thousand H0505 men H0376 of Judah H3063 went H3381 (8799) to the top H5585 of the rock H5553 Etam H5862, and said H0559 (8799) to Samson H8123, Knowest H3045 (8804) thou not that the Philistines H6430 [are] rulers H4910 (8802) over us? what [is] this [that] thou hast done H6213 (8804) unto us? And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, As they did H6213 (8804) unto me, so have I done H6213 (8804) unto them.
015:012 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, We are come down H3381 (8804) to bind H0631 (8800) thee, that we may deliver H5414 (8800) thee into the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430. And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Swear H7650 (8734) unto me, that ye will not fall upon H6293 (8799) me yourselves.
015:013 And they spake H0559 (8799) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), No; but we will bind H0631 (8799) thee fast H0631 (8800), and deliver H5414 (8804) thee into their hand H3027: but surely H4191 (8687) we will not kill H4191 (8686) thee. And they bound H0631 (8799) him with two H8147 new H2319 cords H5688, and brought him up H5927 (8686) from the rock H5553.
015:014 [And] when he came H0935 (8804) unto Lehi H3896, the Philistines H6430 shouted H7321 (8689) against H7125 (8800) him: and the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 came mightily H6743 (8799) upon him, and the cords H5688 that [were] upon his arms H2220 became as flax H6593 that was burnt H1197 (8804) with fire H0784, and his bands H0612 loosed H4549 (8735) from off his hands H3027.
015:015 And he found H4672 (8799) a new H2961 jawbone H3895 of an ass H2543, and put forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and took H3947 (8799) it, and slew H5221 (8686) a thousand H0505 men H0376 therewith.
015:016 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799), With the jawbone H3895 of an ass H2543, heaps H2565 upon heaps H2565, with the jaw H3895 of an ass H2543 have I slain H5221 (8689) a thousand H0505 men H0376.
015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763), that he cast away H7993 (8686) the jawbone H3895 out of his hand H3027, and called H7121 (8799) that place H4725 Ramathlehi H7437.
015:018 And he was sore H3966 athirst H6770 (8799), and called H7121 (8799) on the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), Thou hast given H5414 (8804) this great H1419 deliverance H8668 into the hand H3027 of thy servant H5650: and now shall I die H4191 (8799) for thirst H6772, and fall H5307 (8804) into the hand H3027 of the uncircumcised H6189?
015:019 But God H0430 clave H1234 (8799) an hollow place H4388 that [was] in the jaw H3895, and there came H3318 (8799) water H4325 thereout; and when he had drunk H8354 (8799), his spirit H7307 came again H7725 (8799), and he revived H2421 (8799): wherefore he called H7121 (8802) the name H8034 thereof Enhakkore H5875, which [is] in Lehi H3896 unto this day H3117.
015:020 And he judged H8199 (8799) Israel H3478 in the days H3117 of the Philistines H6430 twenty H6242 years H8141.
016:001 ¶ Then went H3212 (8799) Samson H8123 to Gaza H5804, and saw H7200 (8799) there an harlot H0802 H2181 (8802), and went in H0935 (8799) unto her.
016:002 [And it was told] the Gazites H5841, saying H0559 (8800), Samson H8123 is come H0935 (8804) hither. And they compassed [him] in H5437 (8799), and laid wait H0693 (8799) for him all night H3915 in the gate H8179 of the city H5892, and were quiet H2790 (8691) all the night H3915, saying H0559 (8800), In the morning H1242, when it is day H0216, we shall kill H2026 (8804) him.
016:003 And Samson H8123 lay H7901 (8799) till midnight H2677 H3915, and arose H6965 (8799) at midnight H2677 H3915, and took H0270 (8799) the doors H1817 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892, and the two H8147 posts H4201, and went away H5265 (8799) with them, bar H1280 and all, and put H7760 (8799) [them] upon his shoulders H3802, and carried them up H5927 (8686) to the top H7218 of an hill H2022 that [is] before H6440 Hebron H2275.
016:004 And it came to pass afterward H0310, that he loved H0157 (8799) a woman H0802 in the valley H5158 of Sorek H7796, whose name H8034 [was] Delilah H1807.
016:005 And the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 came up H5927 (8799) unto her, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, Entice H6601 (8761) him, and see H7200 (8798) wherein his great H1419 strength H3581 [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail H3201 (8799) against him, that we may bind H0631 (8804) him to afflict H6031 (8763) him: and we will give H5414 (8799) thee every one H0376 of us eleven hundred H0505 H3967 [pieces] of silver H3701.
016:006 And Delilah H1807 said H0559 (8799) to Samson H8123, Tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee, wherein thy great H1419 strength H3581 [lieth], and wherewith thou mightest be bound H0631 (8735) to afflict H6031 (8763) thee.
016:007 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto her, If they bind H0631 (8799) me with seven H7651 green H3892 withs H3499 that were never dried H2717 (8795), then shall I be weak H2470 (8804), and be as another H0259 man H0120.
016:008 Then the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 brought up H5927 (8686) to her seven H7651 green H3892 withs H3499 which had not been dried H2717 (8795), and she bound H0631 (8799) him with them.
016:009 Now [there were] men lying in wait H0693 (8802), abiding H3427 (8802) with her in the chamber H2315. And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, The Philistines H6430 [be] upon thee, Samson H8123. And he brake H5423 (8762) the withs H3499, as a thread H6616 of tow H5296 is broken H5423 (8735) when it toucheth H7306 (8687) the fire H0784. So his strength H3581 was not known H3045 (8738).
016:010 And Delilah H1807 said H0559 (8799) unto Samson H8123, Behold, thou hast mocked H2048 (8765) me, and told H1696 (8762) me lies H3577: now tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound H0631 (8735).
016:011 And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, If they bind H0631 (8799) me fast H0631 (8800) with new H2319 ropes H5688 that never were occupied H4399 H6213 (8738), then shall I be weak H2470 (8804), and be as another H0259 man H0120.
016:012 Delilah H1807 therefore took H3947 (8799) new H2319 ropes H5688, and bound H0631 (8799) him therewith, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, The Philistines H6430 [be] upon thee, Samson H8123. And [there were] liers in wait H0693 (8802) abiding H3427 (8802) in the chamber H2315. And he brake H5423 (8762) them from off his arms H2220 like a thread H2339.
016:013 And Delilah H1807 said H0559 (8799) unto Samson H8123, Hitherto H2008 thou hast mocked H2048 (8765) me, and told H1696 (8762) me lies H3577: tell H5046 (8685) me wherewith thou mightest be bound H0631 (8735). And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, If thou weavest H0707 (8799) the seven H7651 locks H4253 of my head H7218 with the web H4545.
016:014 And she fastened H8628 (8799) [it] with the pin H3489, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, The Philistines H6430 [be] upon thee, Samson H8123. And he awaked H3364 (8799) out of his sleep H8142, and went away H5265 (8799) with the pin H3489 of the beam H0708, and with the web H4545.
016:015 And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, How H0349 canst thou say H0559 (8799), I love H0157 (8804) thee, when thine heart H3820 [is] not with me? thou hast mocked H2048 (8765) me these three H7969 times H6471, and hast not told H5046 (8689) me wherein thy great H1419 strength H3581 [lieth].
016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed H6693 (8689) him daily H3117 with her words H1697, and urged H0509 (8762) him, [so] that his soul H5315 was vexed H7114 (8799) unto death H4191 (8800);
016:017 That he told H5046 (8686) her all his heart H3820, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, There hath not come H5927 (8804) a razor H4177 upon mine head H7218; for I [have been] a Nazarite H5139 unto God H0430 from my mother’s H0517 womb H0990: if I be shaven H1548 (8795), then my strength H3581 will go H5493 (8804) from me, and I shall become weak H2470 (8804), and be like any [other] man H0120.
016:018 And when Delilah H1807 saw H7200 (8799) that he had told H5046 (8689) her all his heart H3820, she sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) for the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430, saying H0559 (8800), Come up H5927 (8798) this once H6471, for he hath shewed H5046 (8689) me all his heart H3820. Then the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 came up H5927 (8804) unto her, and brought H5927 (8686) money H3701 in their hand H3027.
016:019 And she made him sleep H3462 (8762) upon her knees H1290; and she called H7121 (8799) for a man H0376, and she caused him to shave off H1548 (8762) the seven H7651 locks H4253 of his head H7218; and she began H2490 (8686) to afflict H6031 (8763) him, and his strength H3581 went H5493 (8799) from him.
016:020 And she said H0559 (8799), The Philistines H6430 [be] upon thee, Samson H8123. And he awoke H3364 (8799) out of his sleep H8142, and said H0559 (8799), I will go out H3318 (8799) as at other times before H6471, and shake H5287 (8735) myself. And he wist H3045 (8804) not that the LORD H3068 was departed H5493 (8804) from him.
016:021 But the Philistines H6430 took H0270 (8799) him, and put out H5365 (8762) his eyes H5869, and brought him down H3381 (8686) to Gaza H5804, and bound H0631 (8799) him with fetters of brass H5178; and he did grind H2912 (8802) in the prison H0631 (8803) house H1004.
016:022 Howbeit the hair H8181 of his head H7218 began H2490 (8686) to grow again H6779 (8763) after H0834 he was shaven H1548 (8795).
016:023 Then the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 gathered them together H0622 (8738) for to offer H2076 (8800) a great H1419 sacrifice H2077 unto Dagon H1712 their god H0430, and to rejoice H8057: for they said H0559 (8799), Our god H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) Samson H8123 our enemy H0341 (8802) into our hand H3027.
016:024 And when the people H5971 saw H7200 (8799) him, they praised H1984 (8762) their god H0430: for they said H0559 (8804), Our god H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) into our hands H3027 our enemy H0341 (8802), and the destroyer H2717 (8688) of our country H0776, which slew H2491 many H7235 (8689) of us.
016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts H3820 were merry H2896, that they said H0559 (8799), Call H7121 (8798) for Samson H8123, that he may make us sport H7832 (8762). And they called H7121 (8799) for Samson H8123 out of the prison H0631 (8803) house H1004; and he made them H6440 sport H6711 (8762): and they set H5975 (8686) him between the pillars H5982.
016:026 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799) unto the lad H5288 that held H2388 (8688) him by the hand H3027, Suffer H3240 (8685) me that I may feel H4184 (8685) (8675) H3237 (8685) the pillars H5982 whereupon the house H1004 standeth H3559 (8737), that I may lean H8172 (8735) upon them.
016:027 Now the house H1004 was full H4390 (8804) of men H0582 and women H0802; and all the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 [were] there; and [there were] upon the roof H1406 about three H7969 thousand H0505 men H0376 and women H0802, that beheld H7200 (8802) while Samson H8123 made sport H7832 (8800).
016:028 And Samson H8123 called H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, remember H2142 (8798) me, I pray thee, and strengthen H2388 (8761) me, I pray thee, only this once H6471, O God H0430, that I may be at once H0259 avenged H5358 (8735) H5359 of the Philistines H6430 for my two H8147 eyes H5869.
016:029 And Samson H8123 took hold H3943 (8799) of the two H8147 middle H8432 pillars H5982 upon which the house H1004 stood H3559 (8737), and on which it was borne up H5564 (8735), of the one H0259 with his right hand H3225, and of the other H0259 with his left H8040.
016:030 And Samson H8123 said H0559 (8799), Let me die H4191 (8799) H5315 with the Philistines H6430. And he bowed H5186 (8799) himself with [all his] might H3581; and the house H1004 fell H5307 (8799) upon the lords H5633, and upon all the people H5971 that [were] therein. So the dead H4191 (8801) which he slew H4191 (8689) at his death H4194 were more H7227 than [they] which he slew H4191 (8689) in his life H2416.
016:031 Then his brethren H0251 and all the house H1004 of his father H0001 came down H3381 (8799), and took H5375 (8799) him, and brought [him] up H5927 (8799), and buried H6912 (8799) him between Zorah H6881 and Eshtaol H0847 in the buryingplace H6913 of Manoah H4495 his father H0001. And he judged H8199 (8804) Israel H3478 twenty H6242 years H8141.
017:001 ¶ And there was a man H0376 of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, whose name H8034 [was] Micah H4321.
017:002 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his mother H0517, The eleven hundred H0505 H3967 [shekels] of silver H3701 that were taken H3947 (8795) from thee, about which thou cursedst H0422 (8804), and spakest H0559 (8804) of also in mine ears H0241, behold, the silver H3701 [is] with me; I took H3947 (8804) it. And his mother H0517 said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be thou] of the LORD H3068, my son H1121.
017:003 And when he had restored H7725 (8686) the eleven hundred H0505 H3967 [shekels] of silver H3701 to his mother H0517, his mother H0517 said H0559 (8799), I had wholly H6942 (8687) dedicated H6942 (8689) the silver H3701 unto the LORD H3068 from my hand H3027 for my son H1121, to make H6213 (8800) a graven image H6459 and a molten image H4541: now therefore I will restore H7725 (8686) it unto thee.
017:004 Yet he restored H7725 (8686) the money H3701 unto his mother H0517; and his mother H0517 took H3947 (8799) two hundred H3967 [shekels] of silver H3701, and gave H5414 (8799) them to the founder H6884 (8802), who made H6213 (8799) thereof a graven image H6459 and a molten image H4541: and they were in the house H1004 of Micah H4321.
017:005 And the man H0376 Micah H4318 had an house H1004 of gods H0430, and made H6213 (8799) an ephod H0646, and teraphim H8655, and consecrated H4390 (8762) H3027 one H0259 of his sons H1121, who became his priest H3548.
017:006 In those days H3117 [there was] no king H4428 in Israel H3478, [but] every man H0376 did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in his own eyes H5869.
017:007 And there was a young man H5288 out of Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063 of the family H4940 of Judah H3063, who [was] a Levite H3881, and he sojourned H1481 (8804) there.
017:008 And the man H0376 departed H3212 (8799) out of the city H5892 from Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063 to sojourn H1481 (8800) where he could find H4672 (8799) [a place]: and he came H0935 (8799) to mount H2022 Ephraim H0669 to the house H1004 of Micah H4318, as he journeyed H6213 (8800) H1870.
017:009 And Micah H4318 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Whence H0370 comest H0935 (8799) thou? And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, I [am] a Levite H3881 of Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063, and I go H1980 (8802) to sojourn H1481 (8800) where I may find H4672 (8799) [a place].
017:010 And Micah H4318 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Dwell H3427 (8798) with me, and be unto me a father H0001 and a priest H3548, and I will give H5414 (8799) thee ten H6235 [shekels] of silver H3701 by the year H3117, and a suit H6187 of apparel H0899, and thy victuals H4241. So the Levite H3881 went in H3212 (8799).
017:011 And the Levite H3881 was content H2974 (8686) to dwell H3427 (8800) with the man H0376; and the young man H5288 was unto him as one H0259 of his sons H1121.
017:012 And Micah H4318 consecrated H4390 (8762) H3027 the Levite H3881; and the young man H5288 became his priest H3548, and was in the house H1004 of Micah H4318.
017:013 Then said H0559 (8799) Micah H4318, Now know H3045 (8804) I that the LORD H3068 will do me good H3190 (8686), seeing I have a Levite H3881 to [my] priest H3548.
018:001 ¶ In those days H3117 [there was] no king H4428 in Israel H3478: and in those days H3117 the tribe H7626 of the Danites H1839 sought H1245 (8764) them an inheritance H5159 to dwell in H3427 (8800); for unto that day H3117 [all their] inheritance H5159 had not fallen H5307 (8804) unto them among H8432 the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478.
018:002 And the children H1121 of Dan H1835 sent H7971 (8799) of their family H4940 five H2568 men H0582 from their coasts H7098, men H1121 of valour H2428, from Zorah H6881, and from Eshtaol H0847, to spy H7270 (8763) out the land H0776, and to search H2713 (8800) it; and they said H0559 (8799) unto them, Go H3212 (8798), search H2713 (8798) the land H0776: who when they came H0935 (8799) to mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, to the house H1004 of Micah H4318, they lodged H3885 (8799) there.
018:003 When they [were] by the house H1004 of Micah H4318, they knew H5234 (8689) the voice H6963 of the young man H5288 the Levite H3881: and they turned in H5493 (8799) thither, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Who brought H0935 (8689) thee hither H1988? and what makest H6213 (8802) thou in this [place]? and what hast thou here?
018:004 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus H2090 and thus H2090 dealeth H6213 (8804) Micah H4318 with me, and hath hired H7936 (8799) me, and I am his priest H3548.
018:005 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Ask counsel H7592 (8798), we pray thee, of God H0430, that we may know H3045 (8799) whether our way H1870 which we go H1980 (8802) shall be prosperous H6743 (8686).
018:006 And the priest H3548 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965: before H5227 the LORD H3068 [is] your way H1870 wherein ye go H3212 (8799).
018:007 Then the five H2568 men H0582 departed H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Laish H3919, and saw H7200 (8799) the people H5971 that [were] therein H7130, how they dwelt H3427 (8802) careless H0983, after the manner H4941 of the Zidonians H6722, quiet H8252 (8802) and secure H0982 (8802); and [there was] no magistrate H3423 (8802) H6114 in the land H0776, that might put [them] to shame H3637 (8688) in [any] thing H1697; and they [were] far H7350 from the Zidonians H6722, and had no business H1697 with [any] man H0120.
018:008 And they came H0935 (8799) unto their brethren H0251 to Zorah H6881 and Eshtaol H0847: and their brethren H0251 said H0559 (8799) unto them, What [say] ye?
018:009 And they said H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798), that we may go up H5927 (8799) against them: for we have seen H7200 (8804) the land H0776, and, behold, it [is] very H3966 good H2896: and [are] ye still H2814 (8688)? be not slothful H6101 (8735) to go H3212 (8800), [and] to enter H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) the land H0776.
018:010 When ye go H0935 (8800), ye shall come H0935 (8799) unto a people H5971 secure H0982 (8802), and to a large H7342 land H0776: for God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) it into your hands H3027; a place H4725 where [there is] no want H4270 of any thing H1697 that [is] in the earth H0776.
018:011 And there went H5265 (8799) from thence of the family H4940 of the Danites H1839, out of Zorah H6881 and out of Eshtaol H0847, six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 appointed H2296 (8803) with weapons H3627 of war H4421.
018:012 And they went up H5927 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in Kirjathjearim H7157, in Judah H3063: wherefore they called H7121 (8804) that place H4725 Mahanehdan H4265 unto this day H3117: behold, [it is] behind H0310 Kirjathjearim H7157.
018:013 And they passed H5674 (8799) thence unto mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and came H0935 (8799) unto the house H1004 of Micah H4318.
018:014 Then answered H6030 (8799) the five H2568 men H0582 that went H1980 (8802) to spy out H7270 (8763) the country H0776 of Laish H3919, and said H0559 (8799) unto their brethren H0251, Do ye know H3045 (8804) that there is H3426 in these houses H1004 an ephod H0646, and teraphim H8655, and a graven image H6459, and a molten image H4541? now therefore consider H3045 (8798) what ye have to do H6213 (8799).
018:015 And they turned H5493 (8799) thitherward, and came H0935 (8799) to the house H1004 of the young man H5288 the Levite H3881, [even] unto the house H1004 of Micah H4318, and saluted H7592 (8799) H7965 him.
018:016 And the six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 appointed H2296 (8803) with their weapons H3627 of war H4421, which [were] of the children H1121 of Dan H1835, stood H5324 (8737) by the entering H6607 of the gate H8179.
018:017 And the five H2568 men H0582 that went H1980 (8802) to spy out H7270 (8763) the land H0776 went up H5927 (8799), [and] came in H0935 (8804) thither, [and] took H3947 (8804) the graven image H6459, and the ephod H0646, and the teraphim H8655, and the molten image H4541: and the priest H3548 stood H5324 (8737) in the entering H6607 of the gate H8179 with the six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 [that were] appointed H2296 (8803) with weapons H3627 of war H4421.
018:018 And these went H0935 (8804) into Micah’s H4318 house H1004, and fetched H3947 (8799) the carved image H6459, the ephod H0646, and the teraphim H8655, and the molten image H4541. Then said H0559 (8799) the priest H3548 unto them, What do H6213 (8802) ye?
018:019 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Hold thy peace H2790 (8685), lay H7760 (8798) thine hand H3027 upon thy mouth H6310, and go H3212 (8798) with us, and be to us H1961 (8800) a father H0001 and a priest H3548: [is it] better H2896 for thee to be a priest H3548 unto the house H1004 of one H0259 man H0376, or that thou be a priest H3548 unto a tribe H7626 and a family H4940 in Israel H3478?
018:020 And the priest’s H3548 heart H3820 was glad H3190 (8799), and he took H3947 (8799) the ephod H0646, and the teraphim H8655, and the graven image H6459, and went in H0935 (8799) the midst H7130 of the people H5971.
018:021 So they turned H6437 (8799) and departed H3212 (8799), and put H7760 (8799) the little ones H2945 and the cattle H4735 and the carriage H3520 before H6440 them.
018:022 [And] when they were a good way H7368 (8689) from the house H1004 of Micah H4318, the men H0582 that [were] in the houses H1004 near to Micah’s H4318 house H1004 were gathered together H2199 (8738), and overtook H1692 (8686) the children H1121 of Dan H1835.
018:023 And they cried H7121 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Dan H1835. And they turned H5437 (8686) their faces H6440, and said H0559 (8799) unto Micah H4318, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company H2199 (8738)?
018:024 And he said H0559 (8799), Ye have taken away H3947 (8804) my gods H0430 which I made H6213 (8804), and the priest H3548, and ye are gone away H3212 (8799): and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] ye say H0559 (8799) unto me, What aileth thee?
018:025 And the children H1121 of Dan H1835 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Let not thy voice H6963 be heard H8085 (8686) among us, lest angry H4751 H5315 fellows H0582 run H6293 (8799) upon thee, and thou lose H0622 (8804) thy life H5315, with the lives H5315 of thy household H1004.
018:026 And the children H1121 of Dan H1835 went H3212 (8799) their way H1870: and when Micah H4318 saw H7200 (8799) that they [were] too strong H2389 for him, he turned H6437 (8799) and went back H7725 (8799) unto his house H1004.
018:027 And they took H3947 (8804) [the things] which Micah H4318 had made H6213 (8804), and the priest H3548 which he had, and came H0935 (8799) unto Laish H3919, unto a people H5971 [that were] at quiet H8252 (8802) and secure H0982 (8802): and they smote H5221 (8686) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and burnt H8313 (8804) the city H5892 with fire H0784.
018:028 And [there was] no deliverer H5337 (8688), because it [was] far H7350 from Zidon H6721, and they had no business H1697 with [any] man H0120; and it was in the valley H6010 that [lieth] by Bethrehob H1050. And they built H1129 (8799) a city H5892, and dwelt H3427 (8799) therein.
018:029 And they called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the city H5892 Dan H1835, after the name H8034 of Dan H1835 their father H0001, who was born H3205 (8795) unto Israel H3478: howbeit H0199 the name H8034 of the city H5892 [was] Laish H3919 at the first H7223.
018:030 And the children H1121 of Dan H1835 set up H6965 (8686) the graven image H6459: and Jonathan H3083, the son H1121 of Gershom H1647, the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519, he and his sons H1121 were priests H3548 to the tribe H7626 of Dan H1839 until the day H3117 of the captivity H1540 (8800) of the land H0776.
018:031 And they set them up H7760 (8799) Micah’s H4318 graven image H6459, which he made H6213 (8804), all the time H3117 that the house H1004 of God H0430 was in Shiloh H7887.
019:001 ¶ And it came to pass in those days H3117, when [there was] no king H4428 in Israel H3478, that there was a certain H0376 Levite H3881 sojourning H1481 (8802) on the side H3411 of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, who took H3947 (8799) to him a concubine H0802 H6370 out of Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063.
019:002 And his concubine H6370 played the whore H2181 (8799) against him, and went away H3212 (8799) from him unto her father’s H0001 house H1004 to Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063, and was there four H0702 whole months H2320 H3117.
019:003 And her husband H0376 arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) after H0310 her, to speak H1696 (8763) friendly H3820 unto her, [and] to bring her again H7725 (8687), having his servant H5288 with him, and a couple H6776 of asses H2543: and she brought H0935 (8686) him into her father’s H0001 house H1004: and when the father H0001 of the damsel H5291 saw H7200 (8799) him, he rejoiced H8055 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him.
019:004 And his father in law H2859 (8802), the damsel’s H5291 father H0001, retained H2388 (8686) him; and he abode H3427 (8799) with him three H7969 days H3117: so they did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and lodged H3885 (8799) there.
019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth H7243 day H3117, when they arose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, that he rose up H6965 (8799) to depart H3212 (8800): and the damsel’s H5291 father H0001 said H0559 (8799) unto his son in law H2860, Comfort H5582 (8798) thine heart H3820 with a morsel H6595 of bread H3899, and afterward H0310 go your way H3212 (8799).
019:006 And they sat down H3427 (8799), and did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799) both H8147 of them together H3162: for the damsel’s H5291 father H0001 had said H0559 (8799) unto the man H0376, Be content H2974 (8685), I pray thee, and tarry all night H3885 (8798), and let thine heart H3820 be merry H3190 (8799).
019:007 And when the man H0376 rose up H6965 (8799) to depart H3212 (8800), his father in law H2859 (8802) urged H6484 (8799) him: therefore he lodged H3885 (8799) there again H7725 (8799).
019:008 And he arose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242 on the fifth H2549 day H3117 to depart H3212 (8800): and the damsel’s H5291 father H0001 said H0559 (8799), Comfort H5582 (8798) thine heart H3824, I pray thee. And they tarried H4102 (8701) until afternoon H3117 H5186 (8800), and they did eat H0398 (8799) both H8147 of them.
019:009 And when the man H0376 rose up H6965 (8799) to depart H3212 (8800), he, and his concubine H6370, and his servant H5288, his father in law H2859 (8802), the damsel’s H5291 father H0001, said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, now the day H3117 draweth H7503 (8804) toward evening H6150 (8800), I pray you tarry all night H3885 (8798): behold, the day H3117 groweth to an end H2583 (8800), lodge H3885 (8798) here, that thine heart H3824 may be merry H3190 (8799); and to morrow H4279 get you early H7925 (8689) on your way H1870, that thou mayest go H1980 (8804) home H0168.
019:010 But the man H0376 would H0014 (8804) not tarry that night H3885 (8800), but he rose up H6965 (8799) and departed H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) over against H5227 Jebus H2982, which [is] Jerusalem H3389; and [there were] with him two H6776 asses H2543 saddled H2280 (8803), his concubine H6370 also [was] with him.
019:011 [And] when they [were] by Jebus H2982, the day H3117 was far H3966 spent H7286 (8804); and the servant H5288 said H0559 (8799) unto his master H0113, Come H3212 (8798), I pray thee, and let us turn in H5493 (8799) into this city H5892 of the Jebusites H2983, and lodge H3885 (8799) in it.
019:012 And his master H0113 said H0559 (8799) unto him, We will not turn aside H5493 (8799) hither into the city H5892 of a stranger H5237, that [is] not of the children H1121 of Israel H3478; we will pass over H5674 (8804) to Gibeah H1390.
019:013 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his servant H5288, Come H3212 (8798), and let us draw near H7126 (8799) to one H0259 of these places H4725 to lodge all night H3885 (8804), in Gibeah H1390, or in Ramah H7414.
019:014 And they passed on H5674 (8799) and went their way H3212 (8799); and the sun H8121 went down H0935 (8799) upon them [when they were] by H0681 Gibeah H1390, which [belongeth] to Benjamin H1144.
019:015 And they turned aside H5493 (8799) thither, to go in H0935 (8800) [and] to lodge H3885 (8800) in Gibeah H1390: and when he went in H0935 (8799), he sat him down H3427 (8799) in a street H7339 of the city H5892: for [there was] no man H0376 that took H0622 (8764) them into his house H1004 to lodging H3885 (8800).
019:016 And, behold, there came H0935 (8804) an old H2205 man H0376 from his work H4639 out of the field H7704 at even H6153, which [was] also H0376 of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669; and he sojourned H1481 (8804) in Gibeah H1390: but the men H0582 of the place H4725 [were] Benjamites H1145.
019:017 And when he had lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, he saw H7200 (8799) a wayfaring H0732 (8802) man H0376 in the street H7339 of the city H5892: and the old H2205 man H0376 said H0559 (8799), Whither goest H3212 (8799) thou? and whence H0370 comest H0935 (8799) thou?
019:018 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, We [are] passing H5674 (8802) from Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063 toward the side H3411 of mount H2022 Ephraim H0669; from thence [am] I: and I went H3212 (8799) to Bethlehemjudah H1035 H3063, but I [am now] going H1980 (8802) to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068; and there [is] no man H0376 that receiveth H0622 (8764) me to house H1004.
019:019 Yet there is H3426 both straw H8401 and provender H4554 for our asses H2543; and there is bread H3899 and wine H3196 also for me, and for thy handmaid H0519, and for the young man H5288 [which is] with thy servants H5650: [there is] no want H4270 of any thing H1697.
019:020 And the old H2205 man H0376 said H0559 (8799), Peace H7965 [be] with thee; howsoever H7535 [let] all thy wants H4270 [lie] upon me; only lodge H3885 (8799) not in the street H7339.
019:021 So he brought H0935 (8686) him into his house H1004, and gave provender H1101 (8799) unto the asses H2543: and they washed H7364 (8799) their feet H7272, and did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799).
019:022 [Now] as they were making their hearts H3820 merry H3190 (8688), behold, the men H0582 of the city H5892, certain H0582 sons H1121 of Belial H1100, beset H5437 the house H1004 round about H5437 (8738), [and] beat H1849 (8693) at the door H1817, and spake H0559 (8799) to the master H1167 of the house H1004, the old H2205 man H0376, saying H0559 (8800), Bring forth H3318 (8685) the man H0376 that came H0935 (8804) into thine house H1004, that we may know H3045 (8799) him.
019:023 And the man H0376, the master H1167 of the house H1004, went out H3318 (8799) unto them, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Nay H0408, my brethren H0251, [nay], I pray you, do not [so] wickedly H7489 (8686); seeing H0310 that this man H0376 is come H0935 (8804) into mine house H1004, do H6213 (8799) not this folly H5039.
019:024 Behold, [here is] my daughter H1323 a maiden H1330, and his concubine H6370; them I will bring out H3318 (8686) now, and humble H6031 (8761) ye them, and do H6213 (8798) with them what seemeth H5869 good H2896 unto you: but unto this man H0376 do H6213 (8799) not so H2063 vile H5039 a thing H1697.
019:025 But the men H0582 would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) to him: so the man H0376 took H2388 (8686) his concubine H6370, and brought H3318 (8686) her forth H2351 unto them; and they knew H3045 (8799) her, and abused H5953 (8691) her all the night H3915 until the morning H1242: and when the day H7837 began to spring H5927 (8800), they let her go H7971 (8762).
019:026 Then came H0935 (8799) the woman H0802 in the dawning H6437 (8800) of the day H1242, and fell down H5307 (8799) at the door H6607 of the man’s H0376 house H1004 where her lord H0113 [was], till it was light H0216.
019:027 And her lord H0113 rose up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, and opened H6605 (8799) the doors H1817 of the house H1004, and went out H3318 (8799) to go H3212 (8800) his way H1870: and, behold, the woman H0802 his concubine H6370 was fallen down H5307 (8802) [at] the door H6607 of the house H1004, and her hands H3027 [were] upon the threshold H5592.
019:028 And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, Up H6965 (8798), and let us be going H3212 (8799). But none answered H6030 (8802). Then the man H0376 took H3947 (8799) her [up] upon an ass H2543, and the man H0376 rose up H6965 (8799), and gat H3212 (8799) him unto his place H4725.
019:029 And when he was come H0935 (8799) into his house H1004, he took H3947 (8799) a knife H3979, and laid hold H2388 (8686) on his concubine H6370, and divided H5408 (8762) her, [together] with her bones H6106, into twelve H8147 H6240 pieces H5409, and sent H7971 (8762) her into all the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478.
019:030 And it was so H1961 (8738), that all that saw H7200 (8802) it said H0559 (8804), There was no such deed H2063 done nor seen H7200 (8738) from the day H3117 that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 came up H5927 (8800) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 unto this day H3117: consider H7760 (8798) of it, take advice H5779 (8798), and speak H1696 (8761) [your minds].
020:001 ¶ Then all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8799), and the congregation H5712 was gathered together H6950 (8735) as one H0259 man H0376, from Dan H1835 even to Beersheba H0884, with the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, unto the LORD H3068 in Mizpeh H4709.
020:002 And the chief H6438 of all the people H5971, [even] of all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, presented H3320 (8691) themselves in the assembly H6951 of the people H5971 of God H0430, four H0702 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 footmen H0376 H7273 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719.
020:003 (Now the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 heard H8085 (8799) that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were gone up H5927 (8804) to Mizpeh H4709.) Then said H0559 (8799) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, Tell H1696 (8761) [us], how was H1961 (8738) this wickedness H7451?
020:004 And the Levite H3881 H0376, the husband H0376 of the woman H0802 that was slain H7523 (8737), answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), I came H0935 (8804) into Gibeah H1390 that [belongeth] to Benjamin H1144, I and my concubine H6370, to lodge H3885 (8800).
020:005 And the men H1167 of Gibeah H1390 rose H6965 (8799) against me, and beset H5437 the house H1004 round about H5437 (8799) upon me by night H3915, [and] thought H1819 (8765) to have slain H2026 (8800) me: and my concubine H6370 have they forced H6031 (8765), that she is dead H4191 (8799).
020:006 And I took H0270 (8799) my concubine H6370, and cut her in pieces H5408 (8762), and sent H7971 (8762) her throughout all the country H7704 of the inheritance H5159 of Israel H3478: for they have committed H6213 (8804) lewdness H2154 and folly H5039 in Israel H3478.
020:007 Behold, ye [are] all children H1121 of Israel H3478; give H3051 (8798) here H1988 your advice H1697 and counsel H6098.
020:008 And all the people H5971 arose H6965 (8799) as one H0259 man H0376, saying H0559 (8800), We will not any H0376 [of us] go H3212 (8799) to his tent H0168, neither will we any H0376 [of us] turn H5493 (8799) into his house H1004.
020:009 But now this [shall be] the thing H1697 which we will do H6213 (8799) to Gibeah H1390; [we will go up] by lot H1486 against it;
020:010 And we will take H3947 (8804) ten H6235 men H0582 of an hundred H3967 throughout all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, and an hundred H3967 of a thousand H0505, and a thousand H0505 out of ten thousand H7233, to fetch H3947 (8800) victual H6720 for the people H5971, that they may do H6213 (8800), when they come H0935 (8800) to Gibeah H1387 of Benjamin H1144, according to all the folly H5039 that they have wrought H6213 (8804) in Israel H3478.
020:011 So all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 were gathered H0622 (8735) against the city H5892, knit together H2270 as one H0259 man H0376.
020:012 And the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) men H0582 through all the tribe H7626 of Benjamin H1144, saying H0559 (8800), What wickedness H7451 [is] this that is done H1961 (8738) among you?
020:013 Now therefore deliver H5414 (8798) [us] the men H0582, the children H1121 of Belial H1100, which [are] in Gibeah H1390, that we may put them to death H4191 (8686), and put away H1197 (8762) evil H7451 from Israel H3478. But the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) to the voice H6963 of their brethren H0251 the children H1121 of Israel H3478:
020:014 But the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 gathered themselves together H0622 (8735) out of the cities H5892 unto Gibeah H1390, to go out H3318 (8800) to battle H4421 against the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
020:015 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 were numbered H6485 (8691) at that time H3117 out of the cities H5892 twenty H6242 and six H8337 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719, beside the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gibeah H1390, which were numbered H6485 (8694) seven H7651 hundred H3967 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376.
020:016 Among all this people H5971 [there were] seven H7651 hundred H3967 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376 lefthanded H0334 H3027 H3225; every one could sling H7049 (8802) stones H0068 at an hair H8185 [breadth], and not miss H2398 (8686).
020:017 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478, beside Benjamin H1144, were numbered H6485 (8694) four H0702 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719: all these [were] men H0376 of war H4421.
020:018 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 arose H6965 (8799), and went up H5927 (8799) to the house H1004 of God H0430 (8677) H1008, and asked H7592 (8799) counsel of God H0430, and said H0559 (8799), Which H4310 of us shall go up H5927 (8799) first H8462 to the battle H4421 against the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Judah H3063 [shall go up] first H8462.
020:019 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 rose up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, and encamped H2583 (8799) against Gibeah H1390.
020:020 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8799) to battle H4421 against Benjamin H1144; and the men H0376 of Israel H3478 put themselves in array H6186 (8799) to fight H4421 against them at Gibeah H1390.
020:021 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 came forth H3318 (8799) out of Gibeah H1390, and destroyed down H7843 (8686) to the ground H0776 of the Israelites H3478 that day H3117 twenty H6242 and two H8147 thousand H0505 men H0376.
020:022 And the people H5971 the men H0376 of Israel H3478 encouraged H2388 (8691) themselves, and set their battle H4421 again H3254 (8686) in array H6186 (8800) in the place H4725 where they put themselves in array H6186 (8804) the first H7223 day H3117.
020:023 (And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went up H5927 (8799) and wept H1058 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068 until even H6153, and asked H7592 (8799) counsel of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I go up H5066 (8800) again H3254 (8686) to battle H4421 against the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 my brother H0251? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Go up H5927 (8798) against him.)
020:024 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 came near H7126 (8799) against the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 the second H8145 day H3117.
020:025 And Benjamin H1144 went forth H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) them out of Gibeah H1390 the second H8145 day H3117, and destroyed down H7843 (8686) to the ground H0776 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 again eighteen H8083 H6240 thousand H0505 men H0376; all these drew H8025 (8802) the sword H2719.
020:026 Then all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and all the people H5971, went up H5927 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) unto the house H1004 of God H0430 (8677) H1008, and wept H1058 (8799), and sat H3427 (8799) there before H6440 the LORD H3068, and fasted H6684 (8799) that day H3117 until even H6153, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
020:027 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 enquired H7592 (8799) of the LORD H3068, (for the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of God H0430 [was] there in those days H3117,
020:028 And Phinehas H6372, the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499, the son H1121 of Aaron H0175, stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 it in those days H3117,) saying H0559 (8800), Shall I yet again H3254 (8686) go out H3318 (8800) to battle H4421 against the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 my brother H0251, or shall I cease H2308 (8799)? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Go up H5927 (8798); for to morrow H4279 I will deliver H5414 (8799) them into thine hand H3027.
020:029 And Israel H3478 set H7760 (8799) liers in wait H0693 (8802) round about H5439 Gibeah H1390.
020:030 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went up H5927 (8799) against the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 on the third H7992 day H3117, and put themselves in array H6186 (8799) against Gibeah H1390, as at other times H6471.
020:031 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the people H5971, [and] were drawn away H5423 (8717) from the city H5892; and they began H2490 (8686) to smite H5221 (8687) of the people H5971, [and] kill H2491, as at other times H6471, in the highways H4546, of which one H0259 goeth up H5927 (8802) to the house H1004 of God H0430 (8677) H1008, and the other H0259 to Gibeah H1390 in the field H7704, about thirty H7970 men H0376 of Israel H3478.
020:032 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 said H0559 (8799), They [are] smitten down H5062 (8737) before H6440 us, as at the first H7223. But the children H1121 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8804), Let us flee H5127 (8799), and draw H5423 (8804) them from the city H5892 unto the highways H4546.
020:033 And all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 rose up H6965 (8804) out of their place H4725, and put themselves in array H6186 (8799) at Baaltamar H1193: and the liers in wait H0693 (8802) of Israel H3478 came forth H1518 (8688) out of their places H4725, [even] out of the meadows H4629 of Gibeah H1387.
020:034 And there came H0935 (8799) against H5048 Gibeah H1390 ten H6235 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376 out of all Israel H3478, and the battle H4421 was sore H3513 (8804): but they knew H3045 (8804) not that evil H7451 [was] near H5060 (8802) them.
020:035 And the LORD H3068 smote H5062 (8799) Benjamin H1144 before H6440 Israel H3478: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 destroyed H7843 (8686) of the Benjamites H1145 that day H3117 twenty H6242 and five H2568 thousand H0505 and an hundred H3967 men H0376: all these drew H8025 (8802) the sword H2719.
020:036 So the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 saw H7200 (8799) that they were smitten H5062 (8738): for the men H0376 of Israel H3478 gave H5414 (8799) place H4725 to the Benjamites H1145, because they trusted H0982 (8804) unto the liers in wait H0693 (8802) which they had set H7760 (8804) beside Gibeah H1390.
020:037 And the liers in wait H0693 (8802) hasted H2363 (8689), and rushed H6584 (8799) upon Gibeah H1390; and the liers in wait H0693 (8802) drew [themselves] along H4900 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) all the city H5892 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
020:038 Now there was an appointed sign H4150 between the men H0376 of Israel H3478 and H5973 the liers in wait H0693 (8802), that they should make a great H7235 (8685) flame H4864 with smoke H6227 rise up H5927 (8687) out of the city H5892.
020:039 And when the men H0376 of Israel H3478 retired H2015 (8799) in the battle H4421, Benjamin H1144 began H2490 (8689) to smite H5221 (8687) [and] kill H2491 of the men H0376 of Israel H3478 about thirty H7970 persons H0376: for they said H0559 (8804), Surely H5062 (8736) they are smitten down H5062 (8737) before H6440 us, as [in] the first H7223 battle H4421.
020:040 But when the flame H4864 began H2490 (8689) to arise up H5927 (8800) out of the city H5892 with a pillar H5982 of smoke H6227, the Benjamites H1145 looked H6437 (8799) behind H0310 them, and, behold, the flame H3632 of the city H5892 ascended up H5927 (8804) to heaven H8064.
020:041 And when the men H0376 of Israel H3478 turned again H2015 (8804), the men H0376 of Benjamin H1144 were amazed H0926 (8735): for they saw H7200 (8804) that evil H7451 was come H5060 (8804) upon them.
020:042 Therefore they turned H6437 (8799) [their backs] before H6440 the men H0376 of Israel H3478 unto the way H1870 of the wilderness H4057; but the battle H4421 overtook H1692 (8689) them; and them which [came] out of the cities H5892 they destroyed H7843 (8688) in the midst H8432 of them.
020:043 [Thus] they inclosed H3803 (8765) the Benjamites H1145 round about H3803 (8765), [and] chased H7291 (8689) them, [and] trode them down H1869 (8689) with ease H4496 over against H5227 Gibeah H1390 toward the sunrising H4217 H8121.
020:044 And there fell H5307 (8799) of Benjamin H1144 eighteen H8083 H6240 thousand H0505 men H0376; all these [were] men H0582 of valour H2428.
020:045 And they turned H6437 (8799) and fled H5127 (8799) toward the wilderness H4057 unto the rock H5553 of Rimmon H7417: and they gleaned H5953 (8779) of them in the highways H4546 five H2568 thousand H0505 men H0376; and pursued H1692 (8686) hard after H0310 them unto Gidom H1440, and slew H5221 (8686) two thousand H0505 men H0376 of them.
020:046 So that all which fell H5307 (8802) that day H3117 of Benjamin H1144 were twenty H6242 and five H2568 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) the sword H2719; all these [were] men H0582 of valour H2428.
020:047 But six H8337 hundred H3967 men H0376 turned H6437 (8799) and fled H5127 (8799) to the wilderness H4057 unto the rock H5553 Rimmon H7417, and abode H3427 (8799) in the rock H5553 Rimmon H7417 four H0702 months H2320.
020:048 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 turned again H7725 (8804) upon the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144, and smote H5221 (8686) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, as well the men H4974 of [every] city H5892, as H5704 the beast H0929, and all that came to hand H4672 (8737): also they set H7971 (8765) on fire H0784 all the cities H5892 that they came to H4672 (8737).
021:001 ¶ Now the men H0376 of Israel H3478 had sworn H7650 (8738) in Mizpeh H4709, saying H0559 (8800), There shall not any H0376 of us give H5414 (8799) his daughter H1323 unto Benjamin H1144 to wife H0802.
021:002 And the people H5971 came H0935 (8799) to the house H1004 of God H0430 (8677) H1008, and abode H3427 (8799) there till even H6153 before H6440 God H0430, and lifted up H5375 (8799) their voices H6963, and wept H1058 (8799) H1065 sore H1419;
021:003 And said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, why is this come to pass in Israel H3478, that there should be to day H3117 one H0259 tribe H7626 lacking H6485 (8736) in Israel H3478?
021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that the people H5971 rose early H7925 (8686), and built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002.
021:005 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Who [is there] among all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 that H0834 came H5927 (8804) not up with the congregation H6951 unto the LORD H3068? For they had made a great H1419 oath H7621 concerning him that came not up H5927 (8804) to the LORD H3068 to Mizpeh H4709, saying H0559 (8800), He shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
021:006 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 repented H5162 (8735) them for Benjamin H1144 their brother H0251, and said H0559 (8799), There is one H0259 tribe H7626 cut off H1438 (8738) from Israel H3478 this day H3117.
021:007 How shall we do H6213 (8799) for wives H0802 for them that remain H3498 (8737), seeing we have sworn H7650 (8738) by the LORD H3068 that we will not give H5414 (8800) them of our daughters H1323 to wives H0802?
021:008 And they said H0559 (8799), What one H0259 [is there] of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 that came not up H5927 (8804) to Mizpeh H4709 to the LORD H3068? And, behold, there came H0935 (8804) none H0376 to the camp H4264 from Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 to the assembly H6951.
021:009 For the people H5971 were numbered H6485 (8691), and, behold, [there were] none H0376 of the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 there.
021:010 And the congregation H5712 sent H7971 (8799) thither twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505 men H0376 of the valiantest H1121 H2428, and commanded H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) and smite H5221 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, with the women H0802 and the children H2945.
021:011 And this [is] the thing H1697 that ye shall do H6213 (8799), Ye shall utterly destroy H2763 (8686) every male H2145, and every woman H0802 that hath lain H4904 by man H3045 (8802).
021:012 And they found H4672 (8799) among the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 four H0702 hundred H3967 young H5291 virgins H1330, that had known H3045 (8804) no man H0376 by lying H4904 with any male H2145: and they brought H0935 (8686) them unto the camp H4264 to Shiloh H7887, which [is] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
021:013 And the whole congregation H5712 sent H7971 (8799) [some] to speak H1696 (8762) to the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 that [were] in the rock H5553 Rimmon H7417, and to call H7121 (8799) peaceably H7965 unto them.
021:014 And Benjamin H1144 came again H7725 (8799) at that time H6256; and they gave H5414 (8799) them wives H0802 which they had saved alive H2421 (8765) of the women H0802 of Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568: and yet so they sufficed H4672 (8804) them not.
021:015 And the people H5971 repented H5162 (8737) them for Benjamin H1144, because that the LORD H3068 had made H6213 (8804) a breach H6556 in the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478.
021:016 Then the elders H2205 of the congregation H5712 said H0559 (8799), How shall we do H6213 (8799) for wives H0802 for them that remain H3498 (8737), seeing the women H0802 are destroyed H8045 (8738) out of Benjamin H1144?
021:017 And they said H0559 (8799), [There must be] an inheritance H3425 for them that be escaped H6413 of Benjamin H1144, that a tribe H7626 be not destroyed H4229 (8735) out of Israel H3478.
021:018 Howbeit we may H3201 (8799) not give H5414 (8800) them wives H0802 of our daughters H1323: for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 have sworn H7650 (8738), saying H0559 (8800), Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] he that giveth H5414 (8802) a wife H0802 to Benjamin H1144.
021:019 Then they said H0559 (8799), Behold, [there is] a feast H2282 of the LORD H3068 in Shiloh H7887 yearly H3117 H3117 [in a place] which [is] on the north side H6828 of Bethel H1008, on the east side H4217 H8121 of the highway H4546 that goeth up H5927 (8802) from Bethel H1008 to Shechem H7927, and on the south H5045 of Lebonah H3829.
021:020 Therefore they commanded H6680 (8762) the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) and lie in wait H0693 (8804) in the vineyards H3754;
021:021 And see H7200 (8804), and, behold, if the daughters H1323 of Shiloh H7887 come out H3318 (8799) to dance H2342 (8800) in dances H4246, then come ye out H3318 (8804) of the vineyards H3754, and catch H2414 (8804) you every man H0376 his wife H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Shiloh H7887, and go H1980 (8804) to the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144.
021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers H0001 or their brethren H0251 come H0935 (8799) unto us to complain H7378 (8800), that we will say H0559 (8804) unto them, Be favourable H2603 (8798) unto them for our sakes: because we reserved H3947 (8804) not to each man H0376 his wife H0802 in the war H4421: for ye did not give H5414 (8804) unto them at this time H6256, [that] ye should be guilty H0816 (8799).
021:023 And the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 did so H6213 (8799), and took H5375 (8799) [them] wives H0802, according to their number H4557, of them that danced H2342 (8789), whom they caught H1497 (8804): and they went H3212 (8799) and returned H7725 (8799) unto their inheritance H5159, and repaired H1129 (8799) the cities H5892, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in them.
021:024 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 departed H1980 (8691) thence at that time H6256, every man H0376 to his tribe H7626 and to his family H4940, and they went out H3318 (8799) from thence every man H0376 to his inheritance H5159.
021:025 In those days H3117 [there was] no king H4428 in Israel H3478: every man H0376 did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in his own eyes H5869.
