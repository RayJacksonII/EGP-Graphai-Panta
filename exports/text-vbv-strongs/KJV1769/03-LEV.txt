001:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8799) unto Moses H4872, and spake H1696 (8762) unto him out of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, saying H0559 (8800),
001:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, If any man H0120 of you bring H7126 (8686) an offering H7133 unto the LORD H3068, ye shall bring H7126 (8686) your offering H7133 of the cattle H0929, [even] of the herd H1241, and of the flock H6629.
001:003 If his offering H7133 [be] a burnt sacrifice H5930 of the herd H1241, let him offer H7126 (8686) a male H2145 without blemish H8549: he shall offer H7126 (8686) it of his own voluntary will H7522 at the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
001:004 And he shall put H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of the burnt offering H5930; and it shall be accepted H7521 (8738) for him to make atonement H3722 (8763) for him.
001:005 And he shall kill H7819 (8804) the bullock H1121 H1241 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and the priests H3548, Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121, shall bring H7126 (8689) the blood H1818, and sprinkle H2236 (8804) the blood H1818 round about H5439 upon the altar H4196 that [is by] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
001:006 And he shall flay H6584 (8689) the burnt offering H5930, and cut H5408 (8765) it into his pieces H5409.
001:007 And the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548 shall put H5414 (8804) fire H0784 upon the altar H4196, and lay the wood H6086 in order H6186 (8804) upon the fire H0784:
001:008 And the priests H3548, Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121, shall lay H6186 the parts H5409, the head H7218, and the fat H6309, in order H6186 (8804) upon the wood H6086 that [is] on the fire H0784 which [is] upon the altar H4196:
001:009 But his inwards H7130 and his legs H3767 shall he wash H7364 (8799) in water H4325: and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) all on the altar H4196, [to be] a burnt sacrifice H5930, an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
001:010 And if his offering H7133 [be] of the flocks H6629, [namely], of the sheep H3775, or of the goats H5795, for a burnt sacrifice H5930; he shall bring H7126 (8686) it a male H2145 without blemish H8549.
001:011 And he shall kill H7819 (8804) it on the side H3409 of the altar H4196 northward H6828 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and the priests H3548, Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121, shall sprinkle H2236 (8804) his blood H1818 round about H5439 upon the altar H4196.
001:012 And he shall cut H5408 (8765) it into his pieces H5409, with his head H7218 and his fat H6309: and the priest H3548 shall lay them in order H6186 (8804) on the wood H6086 that [is] on the fire H0784 which [is] upon the altar H4196:
001:013 But he shall wash H7364 (8799) the inwards H7130 and the legs H3767 with water H4325: and the priest H3548 shall bring H7126 (8689) [it] all, and burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196: it [is] a burnt sacrifice H5930, an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice H5930 for his offering H7133 to the LORD H3068 [be] of fowls H5775, then he shall bring H7126 (8689) his offering H7133 of turtledoves H8449, or of young H1121 pigeons H3123.
001:015 And the priest H3548 shall bring H7126 (8689) it unto the altar H4196, and wring off H4454 (8804) his head H7218, and burn H6999 (8689) [it] on the altar H4196; and the blood H1818 thereof shall be wrung out H4680 (8738) at the side H7023 of the altar H4196:
001:016 And he shall pluck away H5493 (8689) his crop H4760 with his feathers H5133, and cast H7993 (8689) it beside H0681 the altar H4196 on the east part H6924, by the place H4725 of the ashes H1880:
001:017 And he shall cleave H8156 (8765) it with the wings H3671 thereof, [but] shall not divide [it] asunder H0914 (8686): and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) it upon the altar H4196, upon the wood H6086 that [is] upon the fire H0784: it [is] a burnt sacrifice H5930, an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
002:001 ¶ And when any H5315 will offer H7126 (8686) a meat H4503 offering H7133 unto the LORD H3068, his offering H7133 shall be [of] fine flour H5560; and he shall pour H3332 (8804) oil H8081 upon it, and put H5414 (8804) frankincense H3828 thereon:
002:002 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) it to Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 the priests H3548: and he shall take H7061 (8804) thereout H8033 his handful H7062 H4393 of the flour H5560 thereof, and of the oil H8081 thereof, with all the frankincense H3828 thereof; and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) the memorial H0234 of it upon the altar H4196, [to be] an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068:
002:003 And the remnant H3498 (8737) of the meat offering H4503 [shall be] Aaron’s H0175 and his sons H1121 ’: [it is] a thing most H6944 holy H6944 of the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801.
002:004 And if thou bring H7126 (8686) an oblation H7133 of a meat offering H4503 baken H3989 in the oven H8574, [it shall be] unleavened H4682 cakes H2471 of fine flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, or unleavened H4682 wafers H7550 anointed H4886 (8803) with oil H8081.
002:005 And if thy oblation H7133 [be] a meat offering H4503 [baken] in a pan H4227, it shall be [of] fine flour H5560 unleavened H4682, mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081.
002:006 Thou shalt part H6626 (8800) it in pieces H6595, and pour H3332 (8804) oil H8081 thereon: it [is] a meat offering H4503.
002:007 And if thy oblation H7133 [be] a meat offering H4503 [baken] in the fryingpan H4802, it shall be made H6213 (8735) [of] fine flour H5560 with oil H8081.
002:008 And thou shalt bring H0935 (8689) the meat offering H4503 that is made H6213 (8735) of these things unto the LORD H3068: and when it is presented H7126 (8689) unto the priest H3548, he shall bring H5066 (8689) it unto the altar H4196.
002:009 And the priest H3548 shall take H7311 (8689) from the meat offering H4503 a memorial H0234 thereof, and shall burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196: [it is] an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
002:010 And that which is left H3498 (8737) of the meat offering H4503 [shall be] Aaron’s H0175 and his sons H1121 ’: [it is] a thing most H6944 holy H6944 of the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801.
002:011 No meat offering H4503, which ye shall bring H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068, shall be made H6213 (8735) with leaven H2557: for ye shall burn H6999 (8686) no leaven H7603, nor any honey H1706, in any offering H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801.
002:012 As for the oblation H7133 of the firstfruits H7225, ye shall offer H7126 (8686) them unto the LORD H3068: but they shall not be burnt H5927 (8799) on the altar H4196 for a sweet H5207 savour H7381.
002:013 And every oblation H7133 of thy meat offering H4503 shalt thou season H4414 (8799) with salt H4417; neither shalt thou suffer the salt H4417 of the covenant H1285 of thy God H0430 to be lacking H7673 (8686) from thy meat offering H4503: with all thine offerings H7133 thou shalt offer H7126 (8686) salt H4417.
002:014 And if thou offer H7126 (8686) a meat offering H4503 of thy firstfruits H1061 unto the LORD H3068, thou shalt offer H7126 (8686) for the meat offering H4503 of thy firstfruits H1061 green ears H0024 of corn dried H7033 (8803) by the fire H0784, [even] corn beaten H1643 out of full ears H3759.
002:015 And thou shalt put H5414 (8804) oil H8081 upon it, and lay H7760 (8804) frankincense H3828 thereon: it [is] a meat offering H4503.
002:016 And the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) the memorial H0234 of it, [part] of the beaten corn H1643 thereof, and [part] of the oil H8081 thereof, with all the frankincense H3828 thereof: [it is] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
003:001 ¶ And if his oblation H7133 [be] a sacrifice H2077 of peace offering H8002, if he offer H7126 (8688) [it] of the herd H1241; whether [it be] a male H2145 or female H5347, he shall offer H7126 (8686) it without blemish H8549 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
003:002 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of his offering H7133, and kill H7819 (8804) it [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 the priests H3548 shall sprinkle H2236 (8804) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196 round about H5439.
003:003 And he shall offer H7126 (8689) of the sacrifice H2077 of the peace offering H8002 an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068; the fat H2459 that covereth H3680 (8764) the inwards H7130, and all the fat H2459 that [is] upon the inwards H7130,
003:004 And the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and the fat H2459 that [is] on them, which [is] by the flanks H3689, and the caul H3508 above the liver H3516, with the kidneys H3629, it shall he take away H5493 (8686).
003:005 And Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 shall burn H6999 (8689) it on the altar H4196 upon the burnt sacrifice H5930, which [is] upon the wood H6086 that [is] on the fire H0784: [it is] an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
003:006 And if his offering H7133 for a sacrifice H2077 of peace offering H8002 unto the LORD H3068 [be] of the flock H6629; male H2145 or female H5347, he shall offer H7126 (8686) it without blemish H8549.
003:007 If he offer H7126 (8688) a lamb H3775 for his offering H7133, then shall he offer H7126 (8689) it before H6440 the LORD H3068.
003:008 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of his offering H7133, and kill H7819 (8804) it before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 shall sprinkle H2236 (8804) the blood H1818 thereof round about H5439 upon the altar H4196.
003:009 And he shall offer H7126 (8689) of the sacrifice H2077 of the peace offering H8002 an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068; the fat H2459 thereof, [and] the whole H8549 rump H0451, it shall he take off H5493 (8686) hard H5980 by the backbone H6096; and the fat H2459 that covereth H3680 (8764) the inwards H7130, and all the fat H2459 that [is] upon the inwards H7130,
003:010 And the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and the fat H2459 that [is] upon them, which [is] by the flanks H3689, and the caul H3508 above the liver H3516, with the kidneys H3629, it shall he take away H5493 (8686).
003:011 And the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) it upon the altar H4196: [it is] the food H3899 of the offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
003:012 And if his offering H7133 [be] a goat H5795, then he shall offer H7126 (8689) it before H6440 the LORD H3068.
003:013 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of it, and kill H7819 (8804) it before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 shall sprinkle H2236 (8804) the blood H1818 thereof upon the altar H4196 round about H5439.
003:014 And he shall offer H7126 (8689) thereof his offering H7133, [even] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068; the fat H2459 that covereth H3680 (8764) the inwards H7130, and all the fat H2459 that [is] upon the inwards H7130,

003:017 [It shall be] a perpetual H5769 statute H2708 for your generations H1755 throughout all your dwellings H4186, that ye eat H0398 (8799) neither fat H2459 nor blood H1818.
004:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
004:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), If a soul H5315 shall sin H2398 (8799) through ignorance H7684 against any of the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 [concerning things] which ought not to be done H6213 (8735), and shall do H6213 (8804) against any H0259 of them H2007:
004:003 If the priest H3548 that is anointed H4899 do sin H2398 (8799) according to the sin H0819 of the people H5971; then let him bring H7126 (8689) for his sin H2403, which he hath sinned H2398 (8804), a young H1241 H1121 bullock H6499 without blemish H8549 unto the LORD H3068 for a sin offering H2403.
004:004 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) the bullock H6499 unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the bullock’s H6499 head H7218, and kill H7819 (8804) the bullock H6499 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
004:005 And the priest H3548 that is anointed H4899 shall take H3947 (8804) of the bullock’s H6499 blood H1818, and bring H0935 (8689) it to the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150:
004:006 And the priest H3548 shall dip H2881 (8804) his finger H0676 in the blood H1818, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) of the blood H1818 seven H7651 times H6471 before H6440 the LORD H3068, before H6440 the vail H6532 of the sanctuary H6944.
004:007 And the priest H3548 shall put H5414 (8804) [some] of the blood H1818 upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 of sweet H5561 incense H7004 before H6440 the LORD H3068, which [is] in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150; and shall pour H8210 (8799) all the blood H1818 of the bullock H6499 at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930, which [is at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
004:008 And he shall take off H7311 (8686) from it all the fat H2459 of the bullock H6499 for the sin offering H2403; the fat H2459 that covereth H3680 (8764) the inwards H7130, and all the fat H2459 that [is] upon the inwards H7130,
004:009 And the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and the fat H2459 that [is] upon them, which [is] by the flanks H3689, and the caul H3508 above the liver H3516, with the kidneys H3629, it shall he take away H5493 (8686),
004:010 As it was taken off H7311 (8714) from the bullock H7794 of the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002: and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) them upon the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930.
004:011 And the skin H5785 of the bullock H6499, and all his flesh H1320, with his head H7218, and with his legs H3767, and his inwards H7130, and his dung H6569,
004:012 Even the whole bullock H6499 shall he carry forth H3318 (8689) without H2351 the camp H4264 unto a clean H2889 place H4725, where the ashes H1880 are poured out H8211, and burn H8313 (8804) him on the wood H6086 with fire H0784: where H0413 the ashes H1880 are poured out H8211 shall he be burnt H8313 (8735).
004:013 And if the whole congregation H5712 of Israel H3478 sin through ignorance H7686 (8799), and the thing H1697 be hid H5956 (8738) from the eyes H5869 of the assembly H6951, and they have done H6213 (8804) [somewhat against] any H0259 of the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 [concerning things] which should not be done H6213 (8735), and are guilty H0816 (8804);
004:014 When the sin H2403, which they have sinned H2398 (8804) against it, is known H3045 (8738), then the congregation H6951 shall offer H7126 (8689) a young H1241 H1121 bullock H6499 for the sin H2403, and bring H0935 (8689) him before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
004:015 And the elders H2205 of the congregation H5712 shall lay H5564 (8804) their hands H3027 upon the head H7218 of the bullock H6499 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and the bullock H6499 shall be killed H7819 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
004:016 And the priest H3548 that is anointed H4899 shall bring H0935 (8689) of the bullock’s H6499 blood H1818 to the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150:
004:017 And the priest H3548 shall dip H2881 (8804) his finger H0676 [in some] of the blood H1818, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) [it] seven H7651 times H6471 before H6440 the LORD H3068, [even] before H6440 the vail H6532.
004:018 And he shall put H5414 (8799) [some] of the blood H1818 upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 which [is] before H6440 the LORD H3068, that [is] in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and shall pour out H8210 (8799) all the blood H1818 at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930, which [is at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
004:019 And he shall take H7311 (8686) all his fat H2459 from him, and burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196.
004:020 And he shall do H6213 (8804) with the bullock H6499 as he did H6213 (8804) with the bullock H6499 for a sin offering H2403, so shall he do H6213 (8799) with this: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for them, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) them.
004:021 And he shall carry forth H3318 (8689) the bullock H6499 without H2351 the camp H4264, and burn H8313 (8804) him as he burned H8313 (8804) the first H7223 bullock H6499: it [is] a sin offering H2403 for the congregation H6951.
004:022 When a ruler H5387 hath sinned H2398 (8799), and done H6213 (8804) [somewhat] through ignorance H7684 [against] any H0259 of the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430 [concerning things] which should not be done H6213 (8735), and is guilty H0816 (8804);
004:023 Or if his sin H2403, wherein he hath sinned H2398 (8804), come to his knowledge H3045 (8717); he shall bring H0935 (8689) his offering H7133, a kid H8163 of the goats H5795, a male H2145 without blemish H8549:
004:024 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of the goat H8163, and kill H7819 (8804) it in the place H4725 where they kill H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930 before H6440 the LORD H3068: it [is] a sin offering H2403.
004:025 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 of the sin offering H2403 with his finger H0676, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930, and shall pour out H8210 (8799) his blood H1818 at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930.
004:026 And he shall burn H6999 (8686) all his fat H2459 upon the altar H4196, as the fat H2459 of the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him as concerning his sin H2403, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
004:027 And if any H0259 one H5315 of the common H0776 people H5971 sin H2398 (8799) through ignorance H7684, while he doeth H6213 (8800) [somewhat against] any H0259 of the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 [concerning things] which ought not to be done H6213 (8735), and be guilty H0816 (8804);
004:028 Or if his sin H2403, which he hath sinned H2398 (8804), come to his knowledge H3045 (8717): then he shall bring H0935 (8689) his offering H7133, a kid H8166 of the goats H5795, a female H5347 without blemish H8549, for his sin H2403 which he hath sinned H2398 (8804).
004:029 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of the sin offering H2403, and slay H7819 (8804) the sin offering H2403 in the place H4725 of the burnt offering H5930.
004:030 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 thereof with his finger H0676, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930, and shall pour out H8210 (8799) all the blood H1818 thereof at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196.
004:031 And he shall take away H5493 (8686) all the fat H2459 thereof, as the fat H2459 is taken away H5493 (8717) from off the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002; and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196 for a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068; and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
004:032 And if he bring H0935 (8686) a lamb H3532 for a sin H2403 offering H7133, he shall bring H0935 (8686) it a female H5347 without blemish H8549.
004:033 And he shall lay H5564 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of the sin offering H2403, and slay H7819 (8804) it for a sin offering H2403 in the place H4725 where they kill H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930.
004:034 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 of the sin offering H2403 with his finger H0676, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930, and shall pour out H8210 (8799) all the blood H1818 thereof at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196:
004:035 And he shall take away H5493 (8686) all the fat H2459 thereof, as the fat H2459 of the lamb H3775 is taken away H5493 (8714) from the sacrifice H2077 of the peace offerings H8002; and the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) them upon the altar H4196, according to the offerings made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for his sin H2403 that he hath committed H2398 (8804), and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
005:001 ¶ And if a soul H5315 sin H2398 (8799), and hear H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of swearing H0423, and [is] a witness H5707, whether H0176 he hath seen H7200 (8804) or known H3045 (8804) [of it]; if he do not utter H5046 (8686) [it], then he shall bear H5375 (8804) his iniquity H5771.
005:002 Or if a soul H5315 touch H5060 (8799) any unclean H2931 thing H1697, whether [it be] a carcase H5038 of an unclean H2931 beast H2416, or a carcase H5038 of unclean H2931 cattle H0929, or the carcase H5038 of unclean H2931 creeping things H8318, and [if] it be hidden H5956 (8738) from him; he also shall be unclean H2931, and guilty H0816 (8804).
005:003 Or if he touch H5060 (8799) the uncleanness H2932 of man H0120, whatsoever uncleanness H2932 [it be] that a man shall be defiled H2930 (8799) withal, and it be hid H5956 (8738) from him; when he knoweth H3045 (8804) [of it], then he shall be guilty H0816 (8804).
005:004 Or if a soul H5315 swear H7650 (8735), pronouncing H0981 (8763) with [his] lips H8193 to do evil H7489 (8687), or to do good H3190 (8687), whatsoever [it be] that a man H0120 shall pronounce H0981 (8762) with an oath H7621, and it be hid H5956 (8738) from him; when he knoweth H3045 (8804) [of it], then he shall be guilty H0816 (8804) in one H0259 of these.
005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty H0816 (8799) in one H0259 of these [things], that he shall confess H3034 (8694) that he hath sinned H2398 (8804) in that [thing]:
005:006 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) his trespass offering H0817 unto the LORD H3068 for his sin H2403 which he hath sinned H2398 (8804), a female H5347 from the flock H6629, a lamb H3776 or a kid H8166 of the goats H5795, for a sin offering H2403; and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him concerning his sin H2403.
005:007 And if he H3027 be not able H1767 to bring H5060 (8686) a lamb H7716, then he shall bring H0935 (8689) for H0854 his trespass H0817, which he hath committed H2398 (8804), two H8147 turtledoves H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, unto the LORD H3068; one H0259 for a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 for a burnt offering H5930.
005:008 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) them unto the priest H3548, who shall offer H7126 (8689) [that] which [is] for the sin offering H2403 first H7223, and wring off H4454 (8804) his head H7218 from H4136 his neck H6203, but shall not divide [it] asunder H0914 (8686):
005:009 And he shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) of the blood H1818 of the sin offering H2403 upon the side H7023 of the altar H4196; and the rest H7604 (8737) of the blood H1818 shall be wrung out H4680 (8735) at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196: it [is] a sin offering H2403.
005:010 And he shall offer H6213 (8799) the second H8145 [for] a burnt offering H5930, according to the manner H4941: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him for his sin H2403 which he hath sinned H2398 (8804), and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
005:011 But if he H3027 be not able to bring H5381 (8686) two H8147 turtledoves H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, then he that sinned H2398 (8804) shall bring H0935 (8689) for his offering H7133 the tenth H6224 part of an ephah H0374 of fine flour H5560 for a sin offering H2403; he shall put H7760 (8799) no oil H8081 upon it, neither shall he put H5414 (8799) [any] frankincense H3828 thereon: for it [is] a sin offering H2403.
005:012 Then shall he bring H0935 (8689) it to the priest H3548, and the priest H3548 shall take H7061 (8804) his handful H4393 H7062 of it, [even] a memorial H0234 thereof, and burn H6999 (8689) [it] on the altar H4196, according to the offerings made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068: it [is] a sin offering H2403.
005:013 And the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him as touching his sin H2403 that he hath sinned H2398 (8804) in one H0259 of these, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him: and [the remnant] shall be the priest’s H3548, as a meat offering H4503.
005:014 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
005:015 If a soul H5315 commit H4603 (8799) a trespass H4604, and sin H2398 (8804) through ignorance H7684, in the holy things H6944 of the LORD H3068; then he shall bring H0935 (8689) for his trespass H0817 unto the LORD H3068 a ram H0352 without blemish H8549 out of the flocks H6629, with thy estimation H6187 by shekels H8255 of silver H3701, after the shekel H8255 of the sanctuary H6944, for a trespass offering H0817:
005:016 And he shall make amends H7999 (8762) for the harm H2398 (8804) that he hath done in the holy thing H6944, and shall add H3254 (8686) the fifth part H2549 thereto, and give H5414 (8804) it unto the priest H3548: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8762) for him with the ram H0352 of the trespass offering H0817, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
005:017 And if a soul H5315 sin H2398 (8799), and commit H6213 (8804) any H0259 of these things which are forbidden to be done H6213 (8735) by the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068; though he wist H3045 (8804) [it] not, yet is he guilty H0816 (8804), and shall bear H5375 (8804) his iniquity H5771.
005:018 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) a ram H0352 without blemish H8549 out of the flock H6629, with thy estimation H6187, for a trespass offering H0817, unto the priest H3548: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him concerning his ignorance H7684 wherein he erred H7683 (8804) and wist H3045 (8804) [it] not, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
005:019 It [is] a trespass offering H0817: he hath certainly H0816 (8800) trespassed H0816 (8804) against the LORD H3068.
006:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
006:002 If a soul H5315 sin H2398 (8799), and commit H4603 (8804) a trespass H4604 against the LORD H3068, and lie H3584 (8765) unto his neighbour H5997 in that which was delivered H6487 him to keep, or in fellowship H8667 H3027, or in a thing taken away by violence H1498, or hath deceived H6231 (8804) his neighbour H5997;
006:003 Or have found H4672 (8804) that which was lost H0009, and lieth H3584 (8765) concerning it, and sweareth H7650 (8738) falsely H8267; in any H0259 of all these that a man H0120 doeth H6213 (8799), sinning H2398 (8800) therein H2007:
006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned H2398 (8799), and is guilty H0816 (8804), that he shall restore H7725 (8689) that H1500 which he took violently away H1497 (8804), or the thing H6233 which he hath deceitfully gotten H6231 (8804), or that which was delivered H6487 H0853 him to keep H6485 (8717), or the lost thing H0009 which he found H4672 (8804),
006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn H7650 (8735) falsely H8267; he shall even restore H7999 (8765) it in the principal H7218, and shall add H3254 the fifth part H2549 more H3254 (8686) thereto, [and] give H5414 (8799) it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day H3117 of his trespass offering H0819.
006:006 And he shall bring H0935 (8686) his trespass offering H0817 unto the LORD H3068, a ram H0352 without blemish H8549 out of the flock H6629, with thy estimation H6187, for a trespass offering H0817, unto the priest H3548:
006:007 And the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him before H6440 the LORD H3068: and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him for any thing H0259 of all that he hath done H6213 (8799) in trespassing H0819 therein.
006:008 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
006:009 Command H6680 (8761) Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121, saying H0559 (8800), This [is] the law H8451 of the burnt offering H5930: It [is] the burnt offering H5930, because of the burning H4169 upon the altar H4196 all night H3915 unto the morning H1242, and the fire H0784 of the altar H4196 shall be burning H3344 (8714) in it.
006:010 And the priest H3548 shall put H3847 (8804) on his linen H0906 garment H4055, and his linen H0906 breeches H4370 shall he put H3847 (8799) upon his flesh H1320, and take up H7311 (8689) the ashes H1880 which the fire H0784 hath consumed H0398 (8799) with the burnt offering H5930 on the altar H4196, and he shall put H7760 (8804) them beside H0681 the altar H4196.
006:011 And he shall put off H6584 (8804) his garments H0899, and put on H3847 (8804) other H0312 garments H0899, and carry forth H3318 (8689) the ashes H1880 without H2351 the camp H4264 unto a clean H2889 place H4725.
006:012 And the fire H0784 upon the altar H4196 shall be burning H3344 (8714) in it; it shall not be put out H3518 (8799): and the priest H3548 shall burn H1197 (8765) wood H6086 on it every morning H1242, and lay the burnt offering H5930 in order H6186 (8804) upon it; and he shall burn H6999 (8689) thereon the fat H2459 of the peace offerings H8002.
006:013 The fire H0784 shall ever H8548 be burning H3344 (8714) upon the altar H4196; it shall never go out H3518 (8799).
006:014 And this [is] the law H8451 of the meat offering H4503: the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 shall offer H7126 (8685) it before H6440 the LORD H3068, before H6440 the altar H4196.
006:015 And he shall take H7311 (8689) of it his handful H7062, of the flour H5560 of the meat offering H4503, and of the oil H8081 thereof, and all the frankincense H3828 which [is] upon the meat offering H4503, and shall burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196 [for] a sweet H5207 savour H7381, [even] the memorial H0234 of it, unto the LORD H3068.
006:016 And the remainder H3498 (8737) thereof shall Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 eat H0398 (8799): with unleavened bread H4682 shall it be eaten H0398 (8735) in the holy H6918 place H4725; in the court H2691 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 they shall eat H0398 (8799) it.
006:017 It shall not be baken H0644 (8735) with leaven H2557. I have given H5414 (8804) it [unto them for] their portion H2506 of my offerings made by fire H0801; it [is] most H6944 holy H6944, as [is] the sin offering H2403, and as the trespass offering H0817.
006:018 All the males H2145 among the children H1121 of Aaron H0175 shall eat H0398 (8799) of it. [It shall be] a statute H2706 for ever H5769 in your generations H1755 concerning the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801: every one that toucheth H5060 (8799) them shall be holy H6942 (8799).
006:019 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
006:020 This [is] the offering H7133 of Aaron H0175 and of his sons H1121, which they shall offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 in the day H3117 when he is anointed H4886 (8736); the tenth part H6224 of an ephah H0374 of fine flour H5560 for a meat offering H4503 perpetual H8548, half H4276 of it in the morning H1242, and half H4276 thereof at night H6153.
006:021 In a pan H4227 it shall be made H6213 (8735) with oil H8081; [and when it is] baken H7246 (8716), thou shalt bring H0935 (8686) it in: [and] the baken H8601 pieces H6595 of the meat offering H4503 shalt thou offer H7126 (8686) [for] a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
006:022 And the priest H3548 of his sons H1121 that is anointed H4899 in his stead shall offer H6213 (8799) it: [it is] a statute H2706 for ever H5769 unto the LORD H3068; it shall be wholly H3632 burnt H6999 (8714).
006:023 For every meat offering H4503 for the priest H3548 shall be wholly burnt H3632: it shall not be eaten H0398 (8735).
006:024 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
006:025 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175 and to his sons H1121, saying H0559 (8800), This [is] the law H8451 of the sin offering H2403: In the place H4725 where the burnt offering H5930 is killed H7819 (8735) shall the sin offering H2403 be killed H7819 (8735) before H6440 the LORD H3068: it [is] most H6944 holy H6944.
006:026 The priest H3548 that offereth it for sin H2398 (8764) shall eat H0398 (8799) it: in the holy H6918 place H4725 shall it be eaten H0398 (8735), in the court H2691 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
006:027 Whatsoever shall touch H5060 (8799) the flesh H1320 thereof shall be holy H6942 (8799): and when there is sprinkled H5137 (8799) of the blood H1818 thereof upon any garment H0899, thou shalt wash H3526 (8762) that whereon it was sprinkled H5137 (8799) in the holy H6918 place H4725.
006:028 But the earthen H2789 vessel H3627 wherein it is sodden H1310 (8792) shall be broken H7665 (8735): and if it be sodden H1310 (8795) in a brasen H5178 pot H3627, it shall be both scoured H4838 (8795), and rinsed H7857 (8795) in water H4325.
006:029 All the males H2145 among the priests H3548 shall eat H0398 (8799) thereof: it [is] most H6944 holy H6944.
006:030 And no sin offering H2403, whereof [any] of the blood H1818 is brought H0935 (8714) into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 to reconcile H3722 (8763) [withal] in the holy H6944 [place], shall be eaten H0398 (8735): it shall be burnt H8313 (8735) in the fire H0784.
007:001 ¶ Likewise this [is] the law H8451 of the trespass offering H0817: it [is] most H6944 holy H6944.
007:002 In the place H4725 where they kill H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930 shall they kill H7819 (8799) the trespass offering H0817: and the blood H1818 thereof shall he sprinkle H2236 (8799) round about H5439 upon the altar H4196.
007:003 And he shall offer H7126 (8686) of it all the fat H2459 thereof; the rump H0451, and the fat H2459 that covereth H3680 (8764) the inwards H7130,
007:004 And the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and the fat H2459 that [is] on them, which [is] by the flanks H3689, and the caul H3508 [that is] above the liver H3516, with the kidneys H3629, it shall he take away H5493 (8686):
007:005 And the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) them upon the altar H4196 [for] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068: it [is] a trespass offering H0817.
007:006 Every male H2145 among the priests H3548 shall eat H0398 (8799) thereof: it shall be eaten H0398 (8735) in the holy H6918 place H4725: it [is] most H6944 holy H6944.
007:007 As the sin offering H2403 [is], so [is] the trespass offering H0817: [there is] one H0259 law H8451 for them: the priest H3548 that maketh atonement H3722 (8762) therewith shall have [it].
007:008 And the priest H3548 that offereth H7126 (8688) any man’s H0376 burnt offering H5930, [even] the priest H3548 shall have to himself the skin H5785 of the burnt offering H5930 which he hath offered H7126 (8689).
007:009 And all the meat offering H4503 that is baken H0644 (8735) in the oven H8574, and all that is dressed H6213 (8738) in the fryingpan H4802, and in the pan H4227, shall be the priest’s H3548 that offereth H7126 (8688) it.
007:010 And every meat offering H4503, mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, and dry H2720, shall all the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 have, one H0376 [as much] as another H0251.
007:011 And this [is] the law H8451 of the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002, which he shall offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068.
007:012 If he offer H7126 (8686) it for a thanksgiving H8426, then he shall offer H7126 (8689) with the sacrifice H2077 of thanksgiving H8426 unleavened H4682 cakes H2471 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, and unleavened H4682 wafers H7550 anointed H4886 (8803) with oil H8081, and cakes H2471 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, of fine flour H5560, fried H7246 (8716).
007:013 Besides the cakes H2471, he shall offer H7126 (8686) [for] his offering H7133 leavened H2557 bread H3899 with the sacrifice H2077 of thanksgiving H8426 of his peace offerings H8002.
007:014 And of it he shall offer H7126 (8689) one H0259 out of the whole oblation H7133 [for] an heave offering H8641 unto the LORD H3068, [and] it shall be the priest’s H3548 that sprinkleth H2236 (8802) the blood H1818 of the peace offerings H8002.
007:015 And the flesh H1320 of the sacrifice H2077 of his peace offerings H8002 for thanksgiving H8426 shall be eaten H0398 (8735) the same day H3117 that it is offered H7133; he shall not leave H3240 (8686) any of it until the morning H1242.
007:016 But if the sacrifice H2077 of his offering H7133 [be] a vow H5088, or a voluntary offering H5071, it shall be eaten H0398 (8735) the same day H3117 that he offereth H7126 (8687) his sacrifice H2077: and on the morrow H4283 also the remainder H3498 (8737) of it shall be eaten H0398 (8735):
007:017 But the remainder H3498 (8737) of the flesh H1320 of the sacrifice H2077 on the third H7992 day H3117 shall be burnt H8313 (8735) with fire H0784.
007:018 And if [any] of the flesh H1320 of the sacrifice H2077 of his peace offerings H8002 be eaten H0398 (8735) at all H0398 (8736) on the third H7992 day H3117, it shall not be accepted H7521 (8735), neither shall it be imputed H2803 (8735) unto him that offereth H7126 (8688) it: it shall be an abomination H6292, and the soul H5315 that eateth H0398 (8802) of it shall bear H5375 (8799) his iniquity H5771.
007:019 And the flesh H1320 that toucheth H5060 (8799) any unclean H2931 [thing] shall not be eaten H0398 (8735); it shall be burnt H8313 (8735) with fire H0784: and as for the flesh H1320, all that be clean H2889 shall eat H0398 (8799) thereof.
007:020 But the soul H5315 that eateth H0398 (8799) [of] the flesh H1320 of the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002, that [pertain] unto the LORD H3068, having his uncleanness H2932 upon him, even that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from his people H5971.
007:021 Moreover the soul H5315 that shall touch H5060 (8799) any unclean H2932 [thing, as] the uncleanness H2932 of man H0120, or [any] unclean H2931 beast H0929, or any abominable H8263 unclean H2931 [thing], and eat H0398 (8804) of the flesh H1320 of the sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002, which [pertain] unto the LORD H3068, even that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from his people H5971.
007:022 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
007:023 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall eat H0398 (8799) no manner of fat H2459, of ox H7794, or of sheep H3775, or of goat H5795.
007:024 And the fat H2459 of the beast that dieth of itself H5038, and the fat H2459 of that which is torn with beasts H2966, may be used H6213 (8735) in any other use H4399: but ye shall in no wise H0398 (8800) eat H0398 (8799) of it.
007:025 For whosoever eateth H0398 (8802) the fat H2459 of the beast H0929, of which men offer H7126 (8686) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068, even the soul H5315 that eateth H0398 (8802) [it] shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from his people H5971.
007:026 Moreover ye shall eat H0398 (8799) no manner of blood H1818, [whether it be] of fowl H5775 or of beast H0929, in any of your dwellings H4186.
007:027 Whatsoever soul H5315 [it be] that eateth H0398 (8799) any manner H3605 of blood H1818, even that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from his people H5971.
007:028 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
007:029 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), He that offereth H7126 (8688) the sacrifice H2077 of his peace offerings H8002 unto the LORD H3068 shall bring H0935 (8686) his oblation H7133 unto the LORD H3068 of the sacrifice H2077 of his peace offerings H8002.
007:030 His own hands H3027 shall bring H0935 (8686) the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801, the fat H2459 with the breast H2373, it shall he bring H0935 (8686), that the breast H2373 may be waved H5130 (8687) [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
007:031 And the priest H3548 shall burn H6999 (8689) the fat H2459 upon the altar H4196: but the breast H2373 shall be Aaron’s H0175 and his sons H1121 ’.
007:032 And the right H3225 shoulder H7785 shall ye give H5414 (8799) unto the priest H3548 [for] an heave offering H8641 of the sacrifices H2077 of your peace offerings H8002.
007:033 He among the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, that offereth H7126 (8688) the blood H1818 of the peace offerings H8002, and the fat H2459, shall have the right H3225 shoulder H7785 for [his] part H4490.
007:034 For the wave H8573 breast H2373 and the heave H8641 shoulder H7785 have I taken H3947 (8804) of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 from off the sacrifices H2077 of their peace offerings H8002, and have given H5414 (8799) them unto Aaron H0175 the priest H3548 and unto his sons H1121 by a statute H2706 for ever H5769 from among the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
007:035 This [is the portion] of the anointing H4888 of Aaron H0175, and of the anointing H4888 of his sons H1121, out of the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801, in the day H3117 [when] he presented H7126 (8689) them to minister unto the LORD H3068 in the priest’s office H3547 (8763);
007:036 Which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) to be given H5414 (8800) them of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, in the day H3117 that he anointed H4886 (8800) them, [by] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 throughout their generations H1755.
007:037 This [is] the law H8451 of the burnt offering H5930, of the meat offering H4503, and of the sin offering H2403, and of the trespass offering H0817, and of the consecrations H4394, and of the sacrifice H2077 of the peace offerings H8002;
007:038 Which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 in mount H2022 Sinai H5514, in the day H3117 that he commanded H6680 (8763) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 to offer H7126 (8687) their oblations H7133 unto the LORD H3068, in the wilderness H4057 of Sinai H5514.
008:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
008:002 Take H3947 (8798) Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 with him, and the garments H0899, and the anointing H4888 oil H8081, and a bullock H6499 for the sin offering H2403, and two H8147 rams H0352, and a basket H5536 of unleavened bread H4682;
008:003 And gather H6950 thou all the congregation H5712 together H6950 (8685) unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
008:004 And Moses H4872 did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) him; and the assembly H5712 was gathered together H6950 (8735) unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
008:005 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto the congregation H5712, This [is] the thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) to be done H6213 (8800).
008:006 And Moses H4872 brought H7126 (8686) Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121, and washed H7364 (8799) them with water H4325.
008:007 And he put H5414 (8799) upon him the coat H3801, and girded H2296 (8799) him with the girdle H0073, and clothed H3847 (8686) him with the robe H4598, and put H5414 (8799) the ephod H0646 upon him, and he girded H2296 (8799) him with the curious girdle H2805 of the ephod H0646, and bound H0640 (8799) [it] unto him therewith.
008:008 And he put H7760 (8799) the breastplate H2833 upon him: also he put H5414 (8799) in the breastplate H2833 the Urim H0224 and the Thummim H8550.
008:009 And he put H7760 (8799) the mitre H4701 upon his head H7218; also upon the mitre H4701, [even] upon his forefront H6440 H4136, did he put H7760 (8799) the golden H2091 plate H6731, the holy H6944 crown H5145; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:010 And Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) the anointing H4888 oil H8081, and anointed H4886 (8799) the tabernacle H4908 and all that [was] therein, and sanctified H6942 (8762) them.
008:011 And he sprinkled H5137 (8686) thereof upon the altar H4196 seven H7651 times H6471, and anointed H4886 (8799) the altar H4196 and all his vessels H3627, both the laver H3595 and his foot H3653, to sanctify H6942 (8763) them.
008:012 And he poured H3332 (8799) of the anointing H4888 oil H8081 upon Aaron’s H0175 head H7218, and anointed H4886 (8799) him, to sanctify H6942 (8763) him.
008:013 And Moses H4872 brought H7126 (8686) Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121, and put H3847 (8686) coats H3801 upon them, and girded H2296 (8799) them with girdles H0073, and put H2280 (8799) bonnets H4021 upon them; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:014 And he brought H5066 (8686) the bullock H6499 for the sin offering H2403: and Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 laid H5564 (8799) their hands H3027 upon the head H7218 of the bullock H6499 for the sin offering H2403.
008:015 And he slew H7819 (8799) [it]; and Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) the blood H1818, and put H5414 (8799) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 round about H5439 with his finger H0676, and purified H2398 (8762) the altar H4196, and poured H3332 (8804) the blood H1818 at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196, and sanctified H6942 (8762) it, to make reconciliation H3722 (8763) upon it.
008:016 And he took H3947 (8799) all the fat H2459 that [was] upon the inwards H7130, and the caul H3508 [above] the liver H3516, and the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and their fat H2459, and Moses H4872 burned H6999 (8686) [it] upon the altar H4196.
008:017 But the bullock H6499, and his hide H5785, his flesh H1320, and his dung H6569, he burnt H8313 (8804) with fire H0784 without H2351 the camp H4264; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:018 And he brought H7126 (8686) the ram H0352 for the burnt offering H5930: and Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 laid H5564 (8799) their hands H3027 upon the head H7218 of the ram H0352.
008:019 And he killed H7819 (8799) [it]; and Moses H4872 sprinkled H2236 (8799) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196 round about H5439.
008:020 And he cut H5408 (8765) the ram H0352 into pieces H5409; and Moses H4872 burnt H6999 (8686) the head H7218, and the pieces H5409, and the fat H6309.
008:021 And he washed H7364 (8804) the inwards H7130 and the legs H3767 in water H4325; and Moses H4872 burnt H6999 (8686) the whole ram H0352 upon the altar H4196: it [was] a burnt sacrifice H5930 for a sweet H5207 savour H7381, [and] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:022 And he brought H7126 (8686) the other H8145 ram H0352, the ram H0352 of consecration H4394: and Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 laid H5564 (8799) their hands H3027 upon the head H7218 of the ram H0352.
008:023 And he slew H7819 (8799) [it]; and Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) of the blood H1818 of it, and put H5414 (8799) [it] upon the tip H8571 of Aaron’s H0175 right H3233 ear H0241, and upon the thumb H0931 of his right H3233 hand H3027, and upon the great toe H0931 of his right H3233 foot H7272.
008:024 And he brought H7126 (8686) Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121, and Moses H4872 put H5414 (8799) of the blood H1818 upon the tip H8571 of their right H3233 ear H0241, and upon the thumbs H0931 of their right H3233 hands H3027, and upon the great toes H0931 of their right H3233 feet H7272: and Moses H4872 sprinkled H2236 (8799) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196 round about H5439.
008:025 And he took H3947 (8799) the fat H2459, and the rump H0451, and all the fat H2459 that [was] upon the inwards H7130, and the caul H3508 [above] the liver H3516, and the two H8147 kidneys H3629, and their fat H2459, and the right H3225 shoulder H7785:
008:026 And out of the basket H5536 of unleavened H4682 bread H3899, that [was] before H6440 the LORD H3068, he took H3947 (8804) one H0259 unleavened H4682 cake H2471, and a cake H2471 of oiled H8081 bread, and one H0259 wafer H7550, and put H7760 (8799) [them] on the fat H2459, and upon the right H3225 shoulder H7785:
008:027 And he put H5414 (8799) all upon Aaron’s H0175 hands H3709, and upon his sons H1121 ’ hands H3709, and waved H5130 (8686) them [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
008:028 And Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) them from off their hands H3709, and burnt H6999 (8686) [them] on the altar H4196 upon the burnt offering H5930: they [were] consecrations H4394 for a sweet H5207 savour H7381: it [is] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
008:029 And Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) the breast H2373, and waved H5130 (8686) it [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068: [for] of the ram H0352 of consecration H4394 it was Moses H4872 ’ part H4490; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:030 And Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) of the anointing H4888 oil H8081, and of the blood H1818 which [was] upon the altar H4196, and sprinkled H5137 (8686) [it] upon Aaron H0175, [and] upon his garments H0899, and upon his sons H1121, and upon his sons H1121 ’ garments H0899 with him; and sanctified H6942 (8762) Aaron H0175, [and] his garments H0899, and his sons H1121, and his sons H1121 ’ garments H0899 with him.
008:031 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175 and to his sons H1121, Boil H1310 (8761) the flesh H1320 [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and there eat H0398 (8799) it with the bread H3899 that [is] in the basket H5536 of consecrations H4394, as I commanded H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 shall eat H0398 (8799) it.
008:032 And that which remaineth H3498 (8737) of the flesh H1320 and of the bread H3899 shall ye burn H8313 (8799) with fire H0784.
008:033 And ye shall not go out H3318 (8799) of the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 [in] seven H7651 days H3117, until the days H3117 of your consecration H4394 be at an end H4390 (8800): for seven H7651 days H3117 shall he consecrate H4390 (8762) H3027 you.
008:034 As he hath done H6213 (8804) this day H3117, [so] the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8765) to do H6213 (8800), to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for you.
008:035 Therefore shall ye abide H3427 (8799) [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 day H3119 and night H3915 seven H7651 days H3117, and keep H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the LORD H3068, that ye die H4191 (8799) not: for so I am commanded H6680 (8795).
008:036 So Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 did H6213 (8799) all things H1697 which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
009:001 ¶ And it came to pass on the eighth H8066 day H3117, [that] Moses H4872 called H7121 (8804) Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121, and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478;
009:002 And he said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, Take H3947 (8798) thee a young H1241 H1121 calf H5695 for a sin offering H2403, and a ram H0352 for a burnt offering H5930, without blemish H8549, and offer H7126 (8685) [them] before H6440 the LORD H3068.
009:003 And unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 thou shalt speak H1696 (8762), saying H0559 (8800), Take H3947 (8798) ye a kid H8163 of the goats H5795 for a sin offering H2403; and a calf H5695 and a lamb H3532, [both] of the first H1121 year H8141, without blemish H8549, for a burnt offering H5930;
009:004 Also a bullock H7794 and a ram H0352 for peace offerings H8002, to sacrifice H2076 (8800) before H6440 the LORD H3068; and a meat offering H4503 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081: for to day H3117 the LORD H3068 will appear H7200 (8738) unto you.
009:005 And they brought H3947 (8799) [that] which Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765) before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and all the congregation H5712 drew near H7126 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
009:006 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799), This [is] the thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) that ye should do H6213 (8799): and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 shall appear H7200 (8735) unto you.
009:007 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, Go H7126 (8798) unto the altar H4196, and offer H6213 (8798) thy sin offering H2403, and thy burnt offering H5930, and make an atonement H3722 (8761) for thyself, and for the people H5971: and offer H6213 (8798) the offering H7133 of the people H5971, and make an atonement H3722 (8761) for them; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765).
009:008 Aaron H0175 therefore went H7126 (8799) unto the altar H4196, and slew H7819 (8799) the calf H5695 of the sin offering H2403, which [was] for himself.
009:009 And the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 brought H7126 (8686) the blood H1818 unto him: and he dipped H2881 (8799) his finger H0676 in the blood H1818, and put H5414 (8799) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196, and poured H3332 (8804) out the blood H1818 at the bottom H3247 of the altar H4196:
009:010 But the fat H2459, and the kidneys H3629, and the caul H3508 above H4480 the liver H3516 of the sin offering H2403, he burnt H6999 (8689) upon the altar H4196; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
009:011 And the flesh H1320 and the hide H5785 he burnt H8313 (8804) with fire H0784 without H2351 the camp H4264.
009:012 And he slew H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930; and Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 presented H4672 (8686) unto him the blood H1818, which he sprinkled H2236 (8799) round about H5439 upon the altar H4196.
009:013 And they presented H4672 (8689) the burnt offering H5930 unto him, with the pieces H5409 thereof, and the head H7218: and he burnt H6999 (8686) [them] upon the altar H4196.
009:014 And he did wash H7364 (8799) the inwards H7130 and the legs H3767, and burnt H6999 (8686) [them] upon the burnt offering H5930 on the altar H4196.
009:015 And he brought H7126 (8686) the people’s H5971 offering H7133, and took H3947 (8799) the goat H8163, which [was] the sin offering H2403 for the people H5971, and slew H7819 (8799) it, and offered it for sin H2398 (8762), as the first H7223.
009:016 And he brought H7126 (8686) the burnt offering H5930, and offered H6213 (8799) it according to the manner H4941.
009:017 And he brought H7126 (8686) the meat offering H4503, and took H4390 (8762) an handful H3709 thereof, and burnt H6999 (8686) [it] upon the altar H4196, beside H0905 the burnt sacrifice H5930 of the morning H1242.
009:018 He slew H7819 (8799) also the bullock H7794 and the ram H0352 [for] a sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002, which [was] for the people H5971: and Aaron’s H0175 sons H1121 presented H4672 (8686) unto him the blood H1818, which he sprinkled H2236 (8799) upon the altar H4196 round about H5439,
009:019 And the fat H2459 of the bullock H7794 and of the ram H0352, the rump H0451, and that which covereth H4374 [the inwards], and the kidneys H3629, and the caul H3508 [above] the liver H3516:
009:020 And they put H7760 (8799) the fat H2459 upon the breasts H2373, and he burnt H6999 (8686) the fat H2459 upon the altar H4196:
009:021 And the breasts H2373 and the right H3225 shoulder H7785 Aaron H0175 waved H5130 (8689) [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068; as Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765).
009:022 And Aaron H0175 lifted up H5375 (8799) his hand H3027 toward the people H5971, and blessed H1288 (8762) them, and came down H3381 (8799) from offering H6213 (8800) of the sin offering H2403, and the burnt offering H5930, and peace offerings H8002.
009:023 And Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 went H0935 (8799) into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and came out H3318 (8799), and blessed H1288 (8762) the people H5971: and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto all the people H5971.
009:024 And there came H3318 (8799) a fire H0784 out from before H6440 the LORD H3068, and consumed H0398 (8799) upon the altar H4196 the burnt offering H5930 and the fat H2459: [which] when all the people H5971 saw H7200 (8799), they shouted H7442 (8799), and fell H5307 (8799) on their faces H6440.
010:001 ¶ And Nadab H5070 and Abihu H0030, the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, took H3947 (8799) either H0376 of them his censer H4289, and put H5414 (8799) fire H0784 therein H2004, and put H7760 (8799) incense H7004 thereon, and offered H7126 (8686) strange H2114 (8801) fire H0784 before H6440 the LORD H3068, which he commanded H6680 (8765) them not.
010:002 And there went out H3318 (8799) fire H0784 from the LORD H3068, and devoured H0398 (8799) them, and they died H4191 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
010:003 Then Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, This [is it] that the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), I will be sanctified H6942 (8735) in them that come nigh H7138 me, and before H6440 all the people H5971 I will be glorified H3513 (8735). And Aaron H0175 held his peace H1826 (8799).
010:004 And Moses H4872 called H7121 (8799) Mishael H4332 and Elzaphan H0469, the sons H1121 of Uzziel H5816 the uncle H1730 of Aaron H0175, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Come near H7126 (8798), carry H5375 (8798) your brethren H0251 from before H6440 the sanctuary H6944 out H2351 of the camp H4264.
010:005 So they went near H7126 (8799), and carried H5375 (8799) them in their coats H3801 out H2351 of the camp H4264; as Moses H4872 had said H1696 (8765).
010:006 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, and unto Eleazar H0499 and unto Ithamar H0385, his sons H1121, Uncover H6544 (8799) not your heads H7218, neither rend H6533 (8799) your clothes H0899; lest ye die H4191 (8799), and lest wrath H7107 (8799) come upon all the people H5712: but let your brethren H0251, the whole house H1004 of Israel H3478, bewail H1058 (8799) the burning H8316 which the LORD H3068 hath kindled H8313 (8804).
010:007 And ye shall not go out H3318 (8799) from the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, lest ye die H4191 (8799): for the anointing H4888 oil H8081 of the LORD H3068 [is] upon you. And they did H6213 (8799) according to the word H1697 of Moses H4872.
010:008 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
010:009 Do not drink H8354 (8799) wine H3196 nor strong drink H7941, thou, nor thy sons H1121 with thee, when ye go H0935 (8800) into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, lest ye die H4191 (8799): [it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 throughout your generations H1755:
010:010 And that ye may put difference H0914 (8687) between holy H6944 and unholy H2455, and between unclean H2931 and clean H2889;
010:011 And that ye may teach H3384 (8687) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 all the statutes H2706 which the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) unto them by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
010:012 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) unto Aaron H0175, and unto Eleazar H0499 and unto Ithamar H0385, his sons H1121 that were left H3498 (8737), Take H3947 (8798) the meat offering H4503 that remaineth H3498 (8737) of the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801, and eat H0398 (8798) it without leaven H4682 beside H0681 the altar H4196: for it [is] most H6944 holy H6944:
010:013 And ye shall eat H0398 (8804) it in the holy H6918 place H4725, because it [is] thy due H2706, and thy sons H1121 ’ due H2706, of the sacrifices H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801: for so I am commanded H6680 (8795).
010:014 And the wave H8573 breast H2373 and heave H8641 shoulder H7785 shall ye eat H0398 (8799) in a clean H2889 place H4725; thou, and thy sons H1121, and thy daughters H1323 with thee: for [they be] thy due H2706, and thy sons H1121 ’ due H2706, [which] are given H5414 (8738) out of the sacrifices H2077 of peace offerings H8002 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
010:015 The heave H8641 shoulder H7785 and the wave H8573 breast H2373 shall they bring H0935 (8686) with the offerings made by fire H0801 of the fat H2459, to wave H5130 (8687) [it for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and it shall be thine, and thy sons H1121 ’ with thee, by a statute H2706 for ever H5769; as the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8765).
010:016 And Moses H4872 diligently H1875 (8800) sought H1875 (8804) the goat H8163 of the sin offering H2403, and, behold, it was burnt H8313 (8795): and he was angry H7107 (8799) with Eleazar H0499 and Ithamar H0385, the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 [which were] left H3498 (8737) [alive], saying H0559 (8800),
010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten H0398 (8804) the sin offering H2403 in the holy H6944 place H4725, seeing it [is] most H6944 holy H6944, and [God] hath given H5414 (8804) it you to bear H5375 (8800) the iniquity H5771 of the congregation H5712, to make atonement H3722 (8763) for them before H6440 the LORD H3068?
010:018 Behold H2005, the blood H1818 of it was not brought H0935 (8717) in within H6441 the holy H6944 [place]: ye should indeed H0398 (8800) have eaten H0398 (8799) it in the holy H6944 [place], as I commanded H6680 (8765).
010:019 And Aaron H0175 said H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, Behold, this day H3117 have they offered H7126 (8689) their sin offering H2403 and their burnt offering H5930 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and such things have befallen H7122 (8799) me: and [if] I had eaten H0398 (8804) the sin offering H2403 to day H3117, should it have been accepted H3190 (8799) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068?
010:020 And when Moses H4872 heard H8085 (8799) [that], he was content H3190 (8799) H5869.
011:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and to Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800) unto them,
011:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), These H2063 [are] the beasts H2416 which ye shall eat H0398 (8799) among all the beasts H0929 that [are] on the earth H0776.
011:003 Whatsoever parteth H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541, and is clovenfooted H8156 (8802) H8157, [and] cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, among the beasts H0929, that shall ye eat H0398 (8799).
011:004 Nevertheless H0389 these shall ye not eat H0398 (8799) of them that chew H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, or of them that divide H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541: [as] the camel H1581, because he cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, but divideth H6536 (8688) not the hoof H6541; he [is] unclean H2931 unto you.
011:005 And the coney H8227, because he cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, but divideth H6536 (8686) not the hoof H6541; he [is] unclean H2931 unto you.
011:006 And the hare H0768, because he cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, but divideth H6536 (8689) not the hoof H6541; he [is] unclean H2931 unto you.
011:007 And the swine H2386, though he divide H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541, and be clovenfooted H8156 (8802) H8157, yet he cheweth H1641 (8735) not the cud H1625; he [is] unclean H2931 to you.
011:008 Of their flesh H1320 shall ye not eat H0398 (8799), and their carcase H5038 shall ye not touch H5060 (8799); they [are] unclean H2931 to you.
011:009 These shall ye eat H0398 (8799) of all that [are] in the waters H4325: whatsoever hath fins H5579 and scales H7193 in the waters H4325, in the seas H3220, and in the rivers H5158, them shall ye eat H0398 (8799).
011:010 And all that have not fins H5579 and scales H7193 in the seas H3220, and in the rivers H5158, of all that move H8318 in the waters H4325, and of any living H2416 thing H5315 which [is] in the waters H4325, they [shall be] an abomination H8263 unto you:
011:011 They shall be even an abomination H8263 unto you; ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) of their flesh H1320, but ye shall have their carcases H5038 in abomination H8262 (8762).
011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins H5579 nor scales H7193 in the waters H4325, that [shall be] an abomination H8263 unto you.
011:013 And these [are they which] ye shall have in abomination H8262 (8762) among H4480 the fowls H5775; they shall not be eaten H0398 (8735), they [are] an abomination H8263: the eagle H5404, and the ossifrage H6538, and the ospray H5822,
011:014 And the vulture H1676, and the kite H0344 after his kind H4327;
011:015 Every raven H6158 after his kind H4327;
011:016 And the owl H1323 H3284, and the night hawk H8464, and the cuckow H7828, and the hawk H5322 after his kind H4327,
011:017 And the little owl H3563, and the cormorant H7994, and the great owl H3244,
011:018 And the swan H8580, and the pelican H6893, and the gier eagle H7360,
011:019 And the stork H2624, the heron H0601 after her kind H4327, and the lapwing H1744, and the bat H5847.
011:020 All fowls H5775 that creep H8318, going H1980 (8802) upon [all] four H0702, [shall be] an abomination H8263 unto you.
011:021 Yet these may ye eat H0398 (8799) of every flying H5775 creeping H8318 thing that goeth H1980 (8802) upon [all] four H0702, which have legs H3767 above H4605 their feet H7272, to leap H5425 (8763) withal H2004 upon the earth H0776;
011:022 [Even] these of them ye may eat H0398 (8799); the locust H0697 after his kind H4327, and the bald locust H5556 after his kind H4327, and the beetle H2728 after his kind H4327, and the grasshopper H2284 after his kind H4327.
011:023 But all [other] flying H5775 creeping things H8318, which have four H0702 feet H7272, [shall be] an abomination H8263 unto you.
011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean H2930 (8691): whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) the carcase H5038 of them shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
011:025 And whosoever beareth H5375 (8802) [ought] of the carcase H5038 of them shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
011:026 [The carcases] of every beast H0929 which divideth H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541, and [is] not clovenfooted H8157 H8156 (8802), nor cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, [are] unclean H2931 unto you: every one that toucheth H5060 (8802) them shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
011:027 And whatsoever H3605 H1992 goeth H1980 (8802) upon his paws H3709, among all manner of beasts H2416 that go H1980 (8802) on [all] four H0702, those [are] unclean H2931 unto you: whoso toucheth H5060 (8802) their carcase H5038 shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
011:028 And he that beareth H5375 (8802) the carcase H5038 of them shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153: they [are] unclean H2931 unto you.
011:029 These also [shall be] unclean H2931 unto you among the creeping things H8318 that creep H8317 (8802) upon the earth H0776; the weasel H2467, and the mouse H5909, and the tortoise H6632 after his kind H4327,
011:030 And the ferret H0604, and the chameleon H3581, and the lizard H3911, and the snail H2546, and the mole H8580.
011:031 These [are] unclean H2931 to you among all that creep H8318: whosoever doth touch H5060 (8802) them, when they be dead H4194, shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
011:032 And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead H4194, doth fall H5307 (8799), it shall be unclean H2930 (8799); whether [it be] any vessel H3627 of wood H6086, or raiment H0899, or skin H5785, or sack H8242, whatsoever vessel H3627 [it be], wherein [any] work H4399 is done H6213 (8735), it must be put H0935 (8714) into water H4325, and it shall be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153; so it shall be cleansed H2891 (8804).
011:033 And every earthen H2789 vessel H3627, whereinto [any] of them falleth H5307 (8799) H8432, whatsoever [is] in it shall be unclean H2930 (8799); and ye shall break H7665 (8799) it.
011:034 Of all meat H0400 which may be eaten H0398 (8735), [that] on which [such] water H4325 cometh H0935 (8799) shall be unclean H2930 (8799): and all drink H4945 that may be drunk H8354 (8735) in every [such] vessel H3627 shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
011:035 And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcase H5038 falleth H5307 (8799) shall be unclean H2930 (8799); [whether it be] oven H8574, or ranges H3600 for pots, they shall be broken down H5422 (8714): [for] they [are] unclean H2931, and shall be unclean H2931 unto you.
011:036 Nevertheless a fountain H4599 or pit H0953, [wherein there is] plenty H4723 of water H4325, shall be clean H2889: but that which toucheth H5060 (8802) their carcase H5038 shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
011:037 And if [any part] of their carcase H5038 fall H5307 (8799) upon any sowing H2221 seed H2233 which is to be sown H2232 (8735), it [shall be] clean H2889.
011:038 But if [any] water H4325 be put H5414 (8714) upon the seed H2233, and [any part] of their carcase H5038 fall H5307 (8804) thereon, it [shall be] unclean H2931 unto you.
011:039 And if any beast H0929, of which ye may eat H0402, die H4191 (8799); he that toucheth H5060 (8802) the carcase H5038 thereof shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
011:040 And he that eateth H0398 (8802) of the carcase H5038 of it shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153: he also that beareth H5375 (8802) the carcase H5038 of it shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
011:041 And every creeping thing H8318 that creepeth H8317 (8802) upon the earth H0776 [shall be] an abomination H8263; it shall not be eaten H0398 (8735).
011:042 Whatsoever goeth H1980 (8802) upon the belly H1512, and whatsoever goeth H1980 (8802) upon [all] four H0702, or whatsoever hath more H7235 (8688) feet H7272 among all creeping things H8318 that creep H8317 (8802) upon the earth H0776, them ye shall not eat H0398 (8799); for they [are] an abomination H8263.
011:043 Ye shall not make H8262 yourselves H5315 abominable H8262 (8762) with any creeping thing H8318 that creepeth H8317 (8802), neither shall ye make yourselves unclean H2933 (8738) with them, that ye should be defiled H2930 (8691) thereby.
011:044 For I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves H6942 (8694), and ye shall be holy H6918; for I [am] holy H6918: neither shall ye defile H2930 (8762) yourselves H5315 with any manner of creeping thing H8318 that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776.
011:045 For I [am] the LORD H3068 that bringeth H5927 (8688) you up out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, to be your God H0430: ye shall therefore be holy H6918, for I [am] holy H6918.
011:046 This [is] the law H8451 of the beasts H0929, and of the fowl H5775, and of every living H2416 creature H5315 that moveth H7430 (8802) in the waters H4325, and of every creature H5315 that creepeth H8317 (8802) upon the earth H0776:
011:047 To make a difference H0914 (8687) between the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889, and between the beast H2416 that may be eaten H0398 (8737) and the beast H2416 that may not be eaten H0398 (8735).
012:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
012:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), If a woman H0802 have conceived seed H2232 (8686), and born H3205 (8804) a man child H2145: then she shall be unclean H2930 (8804) seven H7651 days H3117; according to the days H3117 of the separation H5079 for her infirmity H1738 (8800) shall she be unclean H2930 (8799).
012:003 And in the eighth H8066 day H3117 the flesh H1320 of his foreskin H6190 shall be circumcised H4135 (8735).
012:004 And she shall then continue H3427 (8799) in the blood H1818 of her purifying H2893 three H7969 and thirty H7970 days H3117; she shall touch H5060 (8799) no hallowed H6944 thing, nor come H0935 (8799) into the sanctuary H4720, until the days H3117 H3117 of her purifying H2892 be fulfilled H4390 (8800).
012:005 But if she bear H3205 (8799) a maid child H5347, then she shall be unclean H2930 (8804) two weeks H7620, as in her separation H5079: and she shall continue H3427 (8799) in the blood H1818 of her purifying H2893 threescore H8346 and six H8337 days H3117.
012:006 And when the days H3117 of her purifying H2892 are fulfilled H4390 (8800), for a son H1121, or for a daughter H1323, she shall bring H0935 (8686) a lamb H3532 of the first H1121 year H8141 for a burnt offering H5930, and a young H1121 pigeon H3123, or a turtledove H8449, for a sin offering H2403, unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, unto the priest H3548:
012:007 Who shall offer H7126 (8689) it before H6440 the LORD H3068, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for her; and she shall be cleansed H2891 (8804) from the issue H4726 of her blood H1818. This [is] the law H8451 for her that hath born H3205 (8802) a male H2145 or a female H5347.
012:008 And if she be not able to bring H4672 (8799) H1767 H3027 a lamb H7716, then she shall bring H3947 (8804) two H8147 turtles H8449, or two young H1121 pigeons H3123; the one H0259 for the burnt offering H5930, and the other H0259 for a sin offering H2403: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for her, and she shall be clean H2891 (8804).
013:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
013:002 When a man H0120 shall have in the skin H5785 of his flesh H1320 a rising H7613, a scab H5597, or bright spot H0934, and it be in the skin H5785 of his flesh H1320 [like] the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883; then he shall be brought H0935 (8717) unto Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, or unto one H0259 of his sons H1121 the priests H3548:
013:003 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on the plague H5061 in the skin H5785 of the flesh H1320: and [when] the hair H8181 in the plague H5061 is turned H2015 (8804) white H3836, and the plague H5061 in sight H4758 [be] deeper H6013 than the skin H5785 of his flesh H1320, it [is] a plague H5061 of leprosy H6883: and the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on him, and pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765).
013:004 If the bright spot H0934 [be] white H3836 in the skin H5785 of his flesh H1320, and in sight H4758 [be] not deeper H6013 than the skin H5785, and the hair H8181 thereof be not turned H2015 (8804) white H3836; then the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) up [him that hath] the plague H5061 seven H7651 days H3117:
013:005 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on him the seventh H7637 day H3117: and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 in his sight H5869 be at a stay H5975 (8804), [and] the plague H5061 spread H6581 (8804) not in the skin H5785; then the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) him up seven H7651 days H3117 more H8145:
013:006 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on him again H8145 the seventh H7637 day H3117: and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 [be] somewhat dark H3544, [and] the plague H5061 spread H6581 (8804) not in the skin H5785, the priest H3548 shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765): it [is but] a scab H4556: and he shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and be clean H2891 (8804).
013:007 But if the scab H4556 spread much H6581 (8800) abroad H6581 (8799) in the skin H5785, after H0310 that he hath been seen H7200 (8736) of the priest H3548 for his cleansing H2893, he shall be seen H7200 (8738) of the priest H3548 again H8145:
013:008 And [if] the priest H3548 see H7200 (8804) that, behold, the scab H4556 spreadeth H6581 (8804) in the skin H5785, then the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] a leprosy H6883.
013:009 When the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 is in a man H0120, then he shall be brought H0935 (8717) unto the priest H3548;
013:010 And the priest H3548 shall see H7200 (8804) [him]: and, behold, [if] the rising H7613 [be] white H3836 in the skin H5785, and it have turned H2015 (8804) the hair H8181 white H3836, and [there be] quick H4241 raw H2416 flesh H1320 in the rising H7613;
013:011 It [is] an old H3462 (8737) leprosy H6883 in the skin H5785 of his flesh H1320, and the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765), and shall not shut H5462 (8686) him up: for he [is] unclean H2931.
013:012 And if a leprosy H6883 break out H6524 (8799) abroad H6524 (8800) in the skin H5785, and the leprosy H6883 cover H3680 (8765) all the skin H5785 of [him that hath] the plague H5061 from his head H7218 even to his foot H7272, wheresoever the priest H3548 looketh H4758 H5869;
013:013 Then the priest H3548 shall consider H7200 (8804): and, behold, [if] the leprosy H6883 have covered H3680 (8765) all his flesh H1320, he shall pronounce [him] clean H2891 (8765) [that hath] the plague H5061: it is all turned H2015 (8804) white H3836: he [is] clean H2889.
013:014 But when H3117 raw H2416 flesh H1320 appeareth H7200 (8736) in him, he shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
013:015 And the priest H3548 shall see H7200 (8804) the raw H2416 flesh H1320, and pronounce him to be unclean H2930 (8765): [for] the raw H2416 flesh H1320 [is] unclean H2931: it [is] a leprosy H6883.
013:016 Or if the raw H2416 flesh H1320 turn again H7725 (8799), and be changed H2015 (8738) unto white H3836, he shall come H0935 (8804) unto the priest H3548;
013:017 And the priest H3548 shall see H7200 (8804) him: and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 be turned H2015 (8738) into white H3836; then the priest H3548 shall pronounce [him] clean H2891 (8765) [that hath] the plague H5061: he [is] clean H2889.
013:018 The flesh H1320 also, in which H3588, [even] in the skin H5785 thereof, was a boil H7822, and is healed H7495 (8738),
013:019 And in the place H4725 of the boil H7822 there be a white H3836 rising H7613, or a bright spot H0934, white H3836, and somewhat reddish H0125, and it be shewed H7200 (8738) to the priest H3548;
013:020 And if, when the priest H3548 seeth H7200 (8804) it, behold, it [be] in sight H4758 lower H8217 than the skin H5785, and the hair H8181 thereof be turned H2015 (8804) white H3836; the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] a plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 broken H6524 (8804) out of the boil H7822.
013:021 But if the priest H3548 look H7200 (8799) on it, and, behold, [there be] no white H3836 hairs H8181 therein, and [if] it [be] not lower H8217 than the skin H5785, but [be] somewhat dark H3544; then the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) him up seven H7651 days H3117:
013:022 And if it spread much H6581 (8800) abroad H6581 (8799) in the skin H5785, then the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] a plague H5061.
013:023 But if the bright spot H0934 stay H5975 (8799) in his place, [and] spread H6581 (8804) not, it [is] a burning H6867 boil H7822; and the priest H3548 shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765).
013:024 Or if there be [any] flesh H1320, in the skin H5785 whereof [there is] a hot H0784 burning H4348, and the quick H4241 [flesh] that burneth H4348 have a white H3836 bright spot H0934, somewhat reddish H0125, or white H3836;
013:025 Then the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) upon it: and, behold, [if] the hair H8181 in the bright spot H0934 be turned H2015 (8738) white H3836, and it [be in] sight H4758 deeper H6013 than the skin H5785; it [is] a leprosy H6883 broken H6524 (8804) out of the burning H4348: wherefore the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883.
013:026 But if the priest H3548 look H7200 (8799) on it, and, behold, [there be] no white H3836 hair H8181 in the bright spot H0934, and it [be] no lower H8217 than the [other] skin H5785, but [be] somewhat dark H3544; then the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) him up seven H7651 days H3117:
013:027 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) upon him the seventh H7637 day H3117: [and] if it be spread much H6581 (8800) abroad H6581 (8799) in the skin H5785, then the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883.
013:028 And if the bright H0934 spot H0934 stay H5975 (8799) in his place, [and] spread H6581 (8804) not in the skin H5785, but it [be] somewhat dark H3544; it [is] a rising H7613 of the burning H4348, and the priest H3548 shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765): for it [is] an inflammation H6867 of the burning H4348.
013:029 If a man H0376 or woman H0802 have a plague H5061 upon the head H7218 or the beard H2206;
013:030 Then the priest H3548 shall see H7200 (8804) the plague H5061: and, behold, if it [be] in sight H4758 deeper H6013 than the skin H5785; [and there be] in it a yellow H6669 thin H1851 hair H8181; then the priest H3548 shall pronounce him unclean H2930 (8765): it [is] a dry scall H5424, [even] a leprosy H6883 upon the head H7218 or beard H2206.
013:031 And if the priest H3548 look H7200 (8799) on the plague H5061 of the scall H5424, and, behold, it [be] not in sight H4758 deeper H6013 than the skin H5785, and [that there is] no black H7838 hair H8181 in it; then the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) up [him that hath] the plague H5061 of the scall H5424 seven H7651 days H3117:
013:032 And in the seventh H7637 day H3117 the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on the plague H5061: and, behold, [if] the scall H5424 spread H6581 (8804) not, and there be in it no yellow H6669 hair H8181, and the scall H5424 [be] not in sight H4758 deeper H6013 than the skin H5785;
013:033 He shall be shaven H1548 (8694), but the scall H5424 shall he not shave H1548 (8762); and the priest H3548 shall shut H5462 (8689) up [him that hath] the scall H5424 seven H7651 days H3117 more H8145:
013:034 And in the seventh H7637 day H3117 the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on the scall H5424: and, behold, [if] the scall H5424 be not spread H6581 (8804) in the skin H5785, nor [be] in sight H4758 deeper H6013 than the skin H5785; then the priest H3548 shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765): and he shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and be clean H2891 (8804).
013:035 But if the scall H5424 spread H6581 (8799) much H6581 (8800) in the skin H5785 after H0310 his cleansing H2893;
013:036 Then the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on him: and, behold, if the scall H5424 be spread H6581 (8804) in the skin H5785, the priest H3548 shall not seek H1239 (8762) for yellow H6669 hair H8181; he [is] unclean H2931.
013:037 But if the scall H5424 be in his sight H5869 at a stay H5975 (8804), and [that] there is black H7838 hair H8181 grown H6779 (8804) up therein; the scall H5424 is healed H7495 (8738), he [is] clean H2889: and the priest H3548 shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765).
013:038 If a man H0376 also or a woman H0802 have in the skin H5785 of their flesh H1320 bright spots H0934, [even] white H3836 bright spots H0934;
013:039 Then the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804): and, behold, [if] the bright spots H0934 in the skin H5785 of their flesh H1320 [be] darkish H3544 white H3836; it [is] a freckled spot H0933 [that] groweth H6524 (8804) in the skin H5785; he [is] clean H2889.
013:040 And the man H0376 H3588 whose hair is fallen H4803 (8735) off his head H7218, he [is] bald H7142; [yet is] he clean H2889.
013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen H4803 (8735) off from the part H6285 of his head H7218 toward his face H6440, he [is] forehead bald H1371: [yet is] he clean H2889.
013:042 And if there be in the bald head H7146, or bald forehead H1372, a white H3836 reddish H0125 sore H5061; it [is] a leprosy H6883 sprung H6524 (8802) up in his bald head H7146, or his bald forehead H1372.
013:043 Then the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) upon it: and, behold, [if] the rising H7613 of the sore H5061 [be] white H3836 reddish H0125 in his bald head H7146, or in his bald forehead H1372, as the leprosy H6883 appeareth H4758 in the skin H5785 of the flesh H1320;
013:044 He is a leprous H6879 (8803) man H0376, he [is] unclean H2931: the priest H3548 shall pronounce him utterly H2930 (8763) unclean H2930 (8762); his plague H5061 [is] in his head H7218.
013:045 And the leper H6879 (8803) in whom the plague H5061 [is], his clothes H0899 shall be rent H6533 (8803), and his head H7218 bare H6544 (8803), and he shall put a covering H5844 (8799) upon his upper lip H8222, and shall cry H7121 (8799), Unclean H2931, unclean H2931.
013:046 All the days H3117 wherein the plague H5061 [shall be] in him he shall be defiled H2930 (8799); he [is] unclean H2931: he shall dwell H3427 (8799) alone H0910; without H2351 the camp H4264 [shall] his habitation H4186 [be].
013:047 The garment H0899 also that the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 is in, [whether it be] a woollen H6785 garment H0899, or a linen H6593 garment H0899;
013:048 Whether [it be] in the warp H8359, or woof H6154; of linen H6593, or of woollen H6785; whether in a skin H5785, or in any thing made H4399 of skin H5785;
013:049 And if the plague H5061 be greenish H3422 or reddish H0125 in the garment H0899, or in the skin H5785, either H0176 in the warp H8359, or in the woof H6154, or in any thing H3627 of skin H5785; it [is] a plague H5061 of leprosy H6883, and shall be shewed H7200 (8717) unto the priest H3548:
013:050 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) upon the plague H5061, and shut H5462 (8689) up [it that hath] the plague H5061 seven H7651 days H3117:
013:051 And he shall look H7200 (8804) on the plague H5061 on the seventh H7637 day H3117: if the plague H5061 be spread H6581 (8804) in the garment H0899, either in the warp H8359, or in the woof H6154, or in a skin H5785, [or] in any work H4399 that is made H6213 (8735) of skin H5785; the plague H5061 [is] a fretting H3992 (8688) leprosy H6883; it [is] unclean H2931.
013:052 He shall therefore burn H8313 (8804) that garment H0899, whether warp H8359 or woof H6154, in woollen H6785 or in linen H6593, or any thing H3627 of skin H5785, wherein the plague H5061 is: for it [is] a fretting H3992 (8688) leprosy H6883; it shall be burnt H8313 (8735) in the fire H0784.
013:053 And if the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8799), and, behold, the plague H5061 be not spread H6581 (8804) in the garment H0899, either H0176 in the warp H8359, or H0176 in the woof H6154, or H0176 in any thing H3627 of skin H5785;
013:054 Then the priest H3548 shall command H6680 (8765) that they wash H3526 (8765) [the thing] wherein the plague H5061 [is], and he shall shut H5462 (8689) it up seven H7651 days H3117 more H8145:
013:055 And the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804) on the plague H5061, after H0310 that it is washed H3526 (8718): and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 have not changed H2015 (8804) his colour H5869, and the plague H5061 be not spread H6581 (8804); it [is] unclean H2931; thou shalt burn H8313 (8799) it in the fire H0784; it [is] fret H6356 inward, [whether] it [be] bare within H7146 or without H1372.
013:056 And if the priest H3548 look H7200 (8804), and, behold, the plague H5061 [be] somewhat dark H3544 after H0310 the washing H3526 (8718) of it; then he shall rend H7167 (8804) it out of the garment H0899, or out of the skin H5785, or out of the warp H8359, or out of the woof H6154:
013:057 And if it appear H7200 (8735) still H5750 in the garment H0899, either in the warp H8359, or in the woof H6154, or in any thing H3627 of skin H5785; it [is] a spreading H6524 (8802) [plague]: thou shalt burn H8313 (8799) that wherein the plague H5061 [is] with fire H0784.
013:058 And the garment H0899, either warp H8359, or woof H6154, or whatsoever thing H3627 of skin H5785 [it be], which thou shalt wash H3526 (8762), if the plague H5061 be departed H5493 (8804) from them, then it shall be washed H3526 (8795) the second H8145 time, and shall be clean H2891 (8804).
013:059 This [is] the law H8451 of the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 in a garment H0899 of woollen H6785 or linen H6593, either in the warp H8359, or woof H6154, or any thing H3627 of skins H5785, to pronounce it clean H2891 (8763), or to pronounce it unclean H2930 (8763).
014:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
014:002 This shall be the law H8451 of the leper H6879 (8794) in the day H3117 of his cleansing H2893: He shall be brought H0935 (8717) unto the priest H3548:
014:003 And the priest H3548 shall go forth H3318 (8804) out H2351 of the camp H4264; and the priest H3548 shall look H7200 (8804), and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 be healed H7495 (8738) in the leper H6879 (8803);
014:004 Then shall the priest H3548 command H6680 (8765) to take H3947 (8804) for him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693) two H8147 birds H6833 alive H2416 [and] clean H2889, and cedar H0730 wood H6086, and scarlet H8144 H8438, and hyssop H0231:
014:005 And the priest H3548 shall command H6680 (8765) that one H0259 of the birds H6833 be killed H7819 (8804) in an earthen H2789 vessel H3627 over running H2416 water H4325:
014:006 As for the living H2416 bird H6833, he shall take H3947 (8799) it, and the cedar H0730 wood H6086, and the scarlet H8144 H8438, and the hyssop H0231, and shall dip H2881 (8804) them and the living H2416 bird H6833 in the blood H1818 of the bird H6833 [that was] killed H7819 (8803) over the running H2416 water H4325:
014:007 And he shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) upon him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693) from the leprosy H6883 seven H7651 times H6471, and shall pronounce him clean H2891 (8765), and shall let the living H2416 bird H6833 loose H7971 (8765) into the open H6440 field H7704.
014:008 And he that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693) shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and shave H1548 (8765) off all his hair H8181, and wash H7364 (8804) himself in water H4325, that he may be clean H2891 (8804): and after H0310 that he shall come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264, and shall tarry H3427 (8804) abroad H2351 out of his tent H0168 seven H7651 days H3117.
014:009 But it shall be on the seventh H7637 day H3117, that he shall shave H1548 (8762) all his hair H8181 off his head H7218 and his beard H2206 and his eyebrows H1354 H5869, even all his hair H8181 he shall shave H1548 (8762) off: and he shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, also he shall wash H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and he shall be clean H2891 (8804).
014:010 And on the eighth H8066 day H3117 he shall take H3947 (8799) two H8147 he lambs H3532 without blemish H8549, and one H0259 ewe lamb H3535 of the first H1323 year H8141 without blemish H8549, and three H7969 tenth deals H6241 of fine flour H5560 [for] a meat offering H4503, mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, and one H0259 log H3849 of oil H8081.
014:011 And the priest H3548 that maketh [him] clean H2891 (8764) shall present H5975 (8689) the man H0376 that is to be made clean H2891 (8693), and those things, before H6440 the LORD H3068, [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150:
014:012 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) one H0259 he lamb H3532, and offer H7126 (8689) him for a trespass offering H0817, and the log H3849 of oil H8081, and wave H5130 (8689) them [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068:
014:013 And he shall slay H7819 (8804) the lamb H3532 in the place H4725 where he shall kill H7819 (8799) the sin offering H2403 and the burnt offering H5930, in the holy H6944 place H4725: for as the sin offering H2403 [is] the priest’s H3548, [so is] the trespass offering H0817: it [is] most H6944 holy H6944:
014:014 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) [some] of the blood H1818 of the trespass offering H0817, and the priest H3548 shall put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the tip H8571 of the right H3233 ear H0241 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693), and upon the thumb H0931 of his right H3233 hand H3027, and upon the great toe H0931 of his right H3233 foot H7272:
014:015 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) [some] of the log H3849 of oil H8081, and pour H3332 (8804) [it] into the palm H3709 of his own H3548 left hand H8042:
014:016 And the priest H3548 shall dip H2881 (8804) his right H3233 finger H0676 in the oil H8081 that [is] in his left H8042 hand H3709, and shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) of the oil H8081 with his finger H0676 seven H7651 times H6471 before H6440 the LORD H3068:
014:017 And of the rest H3499 of the oil H8081 that [is] in his hand H3709 shall the priest H3548 put H5414 (8799) upon the tip H8571 of the right H3233 ear H0241 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693), and upon the thumb H0931 of his right H3233 hand H3027, and upon the great toe H0931 of his right H3233 foot H7272, upon the blood H1818 of the trespass offering H0817:
014:018 And the remnant H3498 (8737) of the oil H8081 that [is] in the priest’s H3548 hand H3709 he shall pour H5414 (8799) upon the head H7218 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693): and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him before H6440 the LORD H3068.
014:019 And the priest H3548 shall offer H6213 (8804) the sin offering H2403, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693) from his uncleanness H2932; and afterward H0310 he shall kill H7819 (8799) the burnt offering H5930:
014:020 And the priest H3548 shall offer H5927 (8689) the burnt offering H5930 and the meat offering H4503 upon the altar H4196: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him, and he shall be clean H2891 (8804).
014:021 And if he [be] poor H1800, and cannot get H3027 H5381 (8688) so much; then he shall take H3947 (8804) one H0259 lamb H3532 [for] a trespass offering H0817 to be waved H8573, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for him, and one H0259 tenth deal H6241 of fine flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081 for a meat offering H4503, and a log H3849 of oil H8081;
014:022 And two H8147 turtledoves H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, such as he is able to get H3027 H5381 (8686); and the one H0259 shall be a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 a burnt offering H5930.
014:023 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) them on the eighth H8066 day H3117 for his cleansing H2893 unto the priest H3548, unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, before H6440 the LORD H3068.
014:024 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) the lamb H3532 of the trespass offering H0817, and the log H3849 of oil H8081, and the priest H3548 shall wave H5130 (8689) them [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068:
014:025 And he shall kill H7819 (8804) the lamb H3532 of the trespass offering H0817, and the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) [some] of the blood H1818 of the trespass offering H0817, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the tip H8571 of the right H3233 ear H0241 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693), and upon the thumb H0931 of his right H3233 hand H3027, and upon the great toe H0931 of his right H3233 foot H7272:
014:026 And the priest H3548 shall pour H3332 (8799) of the oil H8081 into the palm H3709 of his own H3548 left hand H8042:
014:027 And the priest H3548 shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) with his right H3233 finger H0676 [some] of the oil H8081 that [is] in his left H8042 hand H3709 seven H7651 times H6471 before H6440 the LORD H3068:
014:028 And the priest H3548 shall put H5414 (8804) of the oil H8081 that [is] in his hand H3709 upon the tip H8571 of the right H3233 ear H0241 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693), and upon the thumb H0931 of his right H3233 hand H3027, and upon the great toe H0931 of his right H3233 foot H7272, upon the place H4725 of the blood H1818 of the trespass offering H0817:
014:029 And the rest H3498 (8737) of the oil H8081 that [is] in the priest’s H3548 hand H3709 he shall put H5414 (8799) upon the head H7218 of him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693), to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for him before H6440 the LORD H3068.
014:030 And he shall offer H6213 (8804) the one H0259 of the turtledoves H8449, or of the young H1121 pigeons H3123, such as H0834 he can get H3027 H5381 (8686);
014:031 [Even] such as he H3027 is able to get H5381 (8686), the one H0259 [for] a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 [for] a burnt offering H5930, with the meat offering H4503: and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him that is to be cleansed H2891 (8693) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
014:032 This [is] the law H8451 [of him] in whom [is] the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883, whose hand H3027 is not able to get H5381 (8686) [that which pertaineth] to his cleansing H2893.
014:033 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
014:034 When ye be come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, which I give H5414 (8802) to you for a possession H0272, and I put H5414 (8804) the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883 in a house H1004 of the land H0776 of your possession H0272;
014:035 And he that owneth the house H1004 shall come H0935 (8804) and tell H5046 (8689) the priest H3548, saying H0559 (8800), It seemeth H7200 (8738) to me [there is] as it were a plague H5061 in the house H1004:
014:036 Then the priest H3548 shall command H6680 (8765) that they empty H6437 (8765) the house H1004, before the priest H3548 go H0935 (8799) [into it] to see H7200 (8800) the plague H5061, that all that [is] in the house H1004 be not made unclean H2930 (8799): and afterward H0310 the priest H3548 shall go H0935 (8799) in to see H7200 (8800) the house H1004:
014:037 And he shall look H7200 (8804) on the plague H5061, and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 [be] in the walls H7023 of the house H1004 with hollow strakes H8258, greenish H3422 or reddish H0125, which in sight H4758 [are] lower H8217 than H4480 the wall H7023;
014:038 Then the priest H3548 shall go H3318 (8804) out of the house H1004 to the door H6607 of the house H1004, and shut H5462 (8689) up the house H1004 seven H7651 days H3117:
014:039 And the priest H3548 shall come again H7725 (8804) the seventh H7637 day H3117, and shall look H7200 (8804): and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 be spread H6581 (8804) in the walls H7023 of the house H1004;
014:040 Then the priest H3548 shall command H6680 (8765) that they take H2502 (8765) away the stones H0068 in which H2004 the plague H5061 [is], and they shall cast H7993 (8689) H0853 them into an unclean H2931 place H4725 without H2351 the city H5892:
014:041 And he shall cause the house H1004 to be scraped H7106 (8686) within H1004 round about H5439, and they shall pour H8210 (8804) out the dust H6083 that they scrape H7096 (8689) off without H2351 the city H5892 into an unclean H2931 place H4725:
014:042 And they shall take H3947 (8804) other H0312 stones H0068, and put H0935 (8689) [them] in the place H8478 of those stones H0068; and he shall take H3947 (8799) other H0312 morter H6083, and shall plaister H2902 (8804) the house H1004.
014:043 And if the plague H5061 come again H7725 (8799), and break H6524 (8804) out in the house H1004, after H0310 that he hath taken H2502 (8765) away the stones H0068, and after H0310 he hath scraped H7096 (8687) the house H1004, and after H0310 it is plaistered H2902 (8736);
014:044 Then the priest H3548 shall come H0935 (8804) and look H7200 (8804), and, behold, [if] the plague H5061 be spread H6581 (8804) in the house H1004, it [is] a fretting H3992 (8688) leprosy H6883 in the house H1004: it [is] unclean H2931.
014:045 And he shall break down H5422 (8804) the house H1004, the stones H0068 of it, and the timber H6086 thereof, and all the morter H6083 of the house H1004; and he shall carry [them] forth H3318 (8689) out H2351 of the city H5892 into an unclean H2931 place H4725.
014:046 Moreover he that goeth H0935 (8802) into the house H1004 all the while H3117 that it is shut H5462 (8689) up shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
014:047 And he that lieth H7901 (8802) in the house H1004 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899; and he that eateth H0398 (8802) in the house H1004 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899.
014:048 And if the priest H3548 shall come in H0935 (8799) H0935 (8800), and look H7200 (8804) [upon it], and, behold, the plague H5061 hath not spread H6581 (8804) in the house H1004, after H0310 the house H1004 was plaistered H2902 (8736): then the priest H3548 shall pronounce the house H1004 clean H2891 (8765), because the plague H5061 is healed H7495 (8738).
014:049 And he shall take H3947 (8804) to cleanse H2398 (8763) the house H1004 two H8147 birds H6833, and cedar H0730 wood H6086, and scarlet H8144 H8438, and hyssop H0231:
014:050 And he shall kill H7819 (8804) the one H0259 of the birds H6833 in an earthen H2789 vessel H3627 over running H2416 water H4325:
014:051 And he shall take H3947 (8804) the cedar H0730 wood H6086, and the hyssop H0231, and the scarlet H8144 H8438, and the living H2416 bird H6833, and dip H2881 (8804) them in the blood H1818 of the slain H7819 (8803) bird H6833, and in the running H2416 water H4325, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) the house H1004 seven H7651 times H6471:
014:052 And he shall cleanse H2398 (8765) the house H1004 with the blood H1818 of the bird H6833, and with the running H2416 water H4325, and with the living H2416 bird H6833, and with the cedar H0730 wood H6086, and with the hyssop H0231, and with the scarlet H8144 H8438:
014:053 But he shall let go H7971 (8765) the living H2416 bird H6833 out H2351 of the city H5892 into the open H6440 fields H7704, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for the house H1004: and it shall be clean H2891 (8804).
014:054 This [is] the law H8451 for all manner of plague H5061 of leprosy H6883, and scall H5424,
014:055 And for the leprosy H6883 of a garment H0899, and of a house H1004,
014:056 And for a rising H7613, and for a scab H5597, and for a bright spot H0934:
014:057 To teach H3384 (8687) when H3117 [it is] unclean H2931, and when H3117 [it is] clean H2889: this [is] the law H8451 of leprosy H6883.
015:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and to Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
015:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When any H0376 man H0376 hath a running issue H2100 (8802) out of his flesh H1320, [because of] his issue H2101 he [is] unclean H2931.
015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness H2932 in his issue H2101: whether his flesh H1320 run H7325 (8804) with his issue H2101, or his flesh H1320 be stopped H2856 (8689) from his issue H2101, it [is] his uncleanness H2932.
015:004 Every bed H4904, whereon he lieth H7901 (8799) that hath the issue H2100 (8802), is unclean H2930 (8799): and every thing H3627, whereon he sitteth H3427 (8799), shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
015:005 And whosoever H0376 toucheth H5060 (8799) his bed H4904 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:006 And he that sitteth H3427 (8802) on [any] thing H3627 whereon he sat H3427 (8799) that hath the issue H2100 (8802) shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:007 And he that toucheth H5060 (8802) the flesh H1320 of him that hath the issue H2100 (8802) shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:008 And if he that hath the issue H2100 (8802) spit H7556 (8799) upon him that is clean H2889; then he shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:009 And what saddle H4817 soever he rideth H7392 (8799) upon that hath the issue H2100 (8802) shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
015:010 And whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) any thing that was under him shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153: and he that beareth H5375 (8802) [any of] those things shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth H5060 (8799) that hath the issue H2100 (8802), and hath not rinsed H7857 (8804) his hands H3027 in water H4325, he shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:012 And the vessel H3627 of earth H2789, that he toucheth H5060 (8799) which hath the issue H2100 (8802), shall be broken H7665 (8735): and every vessel H3627 of wood H6086 shall be rinsed H7857 (8735) in water H4325.
015:013 And when he that hath an issue H2100 (8802) is cleansed H2891 (8799) of his issue H2101; then he shall number H5608 (8804) to himself seven H7651 days H3117 for his cleansing H2893, and wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in running H2416 water H4325, and shall be clean H2891 (8804).
015:014 And on the eighth H8066 day H3117 he shall take H3947 (8799) to him two H8147 turtledoves H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, and come H0935 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and give H5414 (8804) them unto the priest H3548:
015:015 And the priest H3548 shall offer H6213 (8804) them, the one H0259 [for] a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 [for] a burnt offering H5930; and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him before H6440 the LORD H3068 for his issue H2101.
015:016 And if any man’s H0376 seed H2233 of copulation H7902 go out H3318 (8799) from him, then he shall wash H7364 (8804) all his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:017 And every garment H0899, and every skin H5785, whereon is the seed H2233 of copulation H7902, shall be washed H3526 (8795) with water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:018 The woman H0802 also with whom man H0376 shall lie H7901 (8799) [with] seed H2233 of copulation H7902, they shall [both] bathe H7364 (8804) [themselves] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:019 And if a woman H0802 have an issue H2100 (8802), [and] her issue H2101 in her flesh H1320 be blood H1818, she shall be put apart H5079 seven H7651 days H3117: and whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) her shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
015:020 And every thing that she lieth H7901 (8799) upon in her separation H5079 shall be unclean H2930 (8799): every thing also that she sitteth H3427 (8799) upon shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
015:021 And whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) her bed H4904 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:022 And whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) any thing H3627 that she sat H3427 (8799) upon shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:023 And if it [be] on [her] bed H4904, or on any thing H3627 whereon she sitteth H3427 (8802), when he toucheth H5060 (8800) it, he shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until the even H6153.
015:024 And if any man H0376 lie H7901 (8799) with her at all H7901 (8800), and her flowers H5079 be upon him, he shall be unclean H2930 (8804) seven H7651 days H3117; and all the bed H4904 whereon he lieth H7901 (8799) shall be unclean H2930 (8799).
015:025 And if a woman H0802 have H2100 (8799) an issue H2101 of her blood H1818 many H7227 days H3117 out H3808 of the time H6256 of her separation H5079, or if it run H2100 (8799) beyond the time H5921 of her separation H5079; all the days H3117 of the issue H2101 of her uncleanness H2932 shall be as the days H3117 of her separation H5079: she [shall be] unclean H2931.
015:026 Every bed H4904 whereon she lieth H7901 (8799) all the days H3117 of her issue H2101 shall be unto her as the bed H4904 of her separation H5079: and whatsoever H3627 she sitteth H3427 (8799) upon shall be unclean H2931, as the uncleanness H2932 of her separation H5079.
015:027 And whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) those things shall be unclean H2930 (8799), and shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
015:028 But if she be cleansed H2891 (8804) of her issue H2101, then she shall number H5608 (8804) to herself seven H7651 days H3117, and after H0310 that she shall be clean H2891 (8799).
015:029 And on the eighth H8066 day H3117 she shall take H3947 (8799) unto her two H8147 turtles H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, and bring H0935 (8689) them unto the priest H3548, to the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
015:030 And the priest H3548 shall offer H6213 (8804) the one H0259 [for] a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 [for] a burnt offering H5930; and the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for her before H6440 the LORD H3068 for the issue H2101 of her uncleanness H2932.
015:031 Thus shall ye separate H5144 (8689) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 from their uncleanness H2932; that they die H4191 (8799) not in their uncleanness H2932, when they defile H2930 (8763) my tabernacle H4908 that [is] among H8432 them.
015:032 This [is] the law H8451 of him that hath an issue H2100 (8802), and [of him] whose seed H2233 H7902 goeth H3318 (8799) from him, and is defiled H2930 (8800) therewith;
015:033 And of her that is sick H1739 of her flowers H5079, and of him that hath H2100 (8802) an issue H2101, of the man H2145, and of the woman H5347, and of him H0376 that lieth H7901 (8799) with her that is unclean H2931.
016:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 after H0310 the death H4194 of the two H8147 sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, when they offered H7126 (8800) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and died H4191 (8799);
016:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175 thy brother H0251, that he come H0935 (8799) not at all times H6256 into the holy H6944 [place] within H1004 the vail H6532 before H6440 the mercy seat H3727, which [is] upon the ark H0727; that he die H4191 (8799) not: for I will appear H7200 (8735) in the cloud H6051 upon the mercy H3727 seat.
016:003 Thus H2063 shall Aaron H0175 come H0935 (8799) into the holy H6944 [place]: with a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 for a sin offering H2403, and a ram H0352 for a burnt offering H5930.
016:004 He shall put on H3847 (8799) the holy H6944 linen H0906 coat H3801, and he shall have the linen H0906 breeches H4370 upon his flesh H1320, and shall be girded H2296 (8799) with a linen H0906 girdle H0073, and with the linen H0906 mitre H4701 shall he be attired H6801 (8799): these H1992 [are] holy H6944 garments H0899; therefore shall he wash H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and [so] put them on H3847 (8804).
016:005 And he shall take H3947 (8799) of the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 two H8147 kids H8163 of the goats H5795 for a sin offering H2403, and one H0259 ram H0352 for a burnt offering H5930.
016:006 And Aaron H0175 shall offer H7126 (8689) his bullock H6499 of the sin offering H2403, which [is] for himself H1157, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for himself, and for his house H1004.
016:007 And he shall take H3947 (8804) the two H8147 goats H8163, and present H5975 (8689) them before H6440 the LORD H3068 [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
016:008 And Aaron H0175 shall cast H5414 (8804) lots H1486 upon the two H8147 goats H8163; one H0259 lot H1486 for the LORD H3068, and the other H0259 lot H1486 for the scapegoat H5799.
016:009 And Aaron H0175 shall bring H7126 (8689) the goat H8163 upon which the LORD’S H3068 lot H1486 fell H5927 (8804), and offer H6213 (8804) him [for] a sin offering H2403.
016:010 But the goat H8163, on which the lot H1486 fell H5927 (8804) to be the scapegoat H5799, shall be presented H5975 (8714) alive H2416 before H6440 the LORD H3068, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) with him, [and] to let him go H7971 (8763) for a scapegoat H5799 into the wilderness H4057.
016:011 And Aaron H0175 shall bring H7126 (8689) the bullock H6499 of the sin offering H2403, which [is] for himself, and shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for himself, and for his house H1004, and shall kill H7819 (8804) the bullock H6499 of the sin offering H2403 which [is] for himself:
016:012 And he shall take H3947 (8804) a censer H4289 full H4393 of burning H0784 coals H1513 of fire H0784 from off the altar H4196 before H6440 the LORD H3068, and his hands H2651 full H4393 of sweet H5561 incense H7004 beaten small H1851, and bring H0935 (8689) [it] within H1004 the vail H6532:
016:013 And he shall put H5414 (8804) the incense H7004 upon the fire H0784 before H6440 the LORD H3068, that the cloud H6051 of the incense H7004 may cover H3680 (8765) the mercy seat H3727 that [is] upon the testimony H5715, that he die H4191 (8799) not:
016:014 And he shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 of the bullock H6499, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) [it] with his finger H0676 upon the mercy seat H3727 eastward H6924; and before H6440 the mercy seat H3727 shall he sprinkle H5137 (8686) of the blood H1818 with his finger H0676 seven H7651 times H6471.
016:015 Then shall he kill H7819 (8804) the goat H8163 of the sin offering H2403, that [is] for the people H5971, and bring H0935 (8689) his blood H1818 within H1004 the vail H6532, and do H6213 (8804) with that blood H1818 as he did H6213 (8804) with the blood H1818 of the bullock H6499, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) it upon the mercy seat H3727, and before H6440 the mercy seat H3727:
016:016 And he shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for the holy H6944 [place], because of the uncleanness H2932 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and because of their transgressions H6588 in all their sins H2403: and so shall he do H6213 (8799) for the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, that remaineth H7931 (8802) among them in the midst H8432 of their uncleanness H2932.
016:017 And there shall be no man H0120 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 when he goeth H0935 (8800) in to make an atonement H3722 (8763) in the holy H6944 [place], until he come out H3318 (8800), and have made an atonement H3722 (8765) for himself, and for his household H1004, and for all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478.
016:018 And he shall go out H3318 (8804) unto the altar H4196 that [is] before H6440 the LORD H3068, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for it; and shall take H3947 (8804) of the blood H1818 of the bullock H6499, and of the blood H1818 of the goat H8163, and put H5414 (8804) [it] upon the horns H7161 of the altar H4196 round about H5439.
016:019 And he shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) of the blood H1818 upon it with his finger H0676 seven H7651 times H6471, and cleanse H2891 (8765) it, and hallow H6942 (8765) it from the uncleanness H2932 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
016:020 And when he hath made an end H3615 (8765) of reconciling H3722 (8763) the holy H6944 [place], and the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and the altar H4196, he shall bring H7126 (8689) the live H2416 goat H8163:
016:021 And Aaron H0175 shall lay H5564 (8804) both H8147 his hands H3027 upon the head H7218 of the live H2416 goat H8163, and confess H3034 (8694) over him all the iniquities H5771 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and all their transgressions H6588 in all their sins H2403, putting H5414 (8804) them upon the head H7218 of the goat H8163, and shall send [him] away H7971 (8765) by the hand H3027 of a fit H6261 man H0376 into the wilderness H4057:
016:022 And the goat H8163 shall bear H5375 (8804) upon him all their iniquities H5771 unto a land H0776 not inhabited H1509: and he shall let go H7971 (8765) the goat H8163 in the wilderness H4057.
016:023 And Aaron H0175 shall come H0935 (8804) into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and shall put off H6584 (8804) the linen H0906 garments H0899, which he put on H3847 (8804) when he went H0935 (8800) into the holy H6944 [place], and shall leave H3240 (8689) them there:
016:024 And he shall wash H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 with water H4325 in the holy H6918 place H4725, and put on H3847 (8804) his garments H0899, and come forth H3318 (8804), and offer H6213 (8804) his burnt offering H5930, and the burnt offering H5930 of the people H5971, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for himself, and for the people H5971.
016:025 And the fat H2459 of the sin offering H2403 shall he burn H6999 (8686) upon the altar H4196.
016:026 And he that let go H7971 (8764) the goat H8163 for the scapegoat H5799 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and afterward H0310 come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264.
016:027 And the bullock H6499 [for] the sin offering H2403, and the goat H8163 [for] the sin offering H2403, whose blood H1818 was brought in H0935 (8717) to make atonement H3722 (8763) in the holy H6944 [place], shall [one] carry forth H3318 (8686) without H2351 the camp H4264; and they shall burn H8313 (8804) in the fire H0784 their skins H5785, and their flesh H1320, and their dung H6569.
016:028 And he that burneth H8313 (8802) them shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and afterward H0310 he shall come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264.
016:029 And [this] shall be a statute H2708 for ever H5769 unto you: [that] in the seventh H7637 month H2320, on the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, ye shall afflict H6031 (8762) your souls H5315, and do H6213 (8799) no work H4399 at all, [whether it be] one of your own country H0249, or a stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 you:
016:030 For on that day H3117 shall [the priest] make an atonement H3722 (8762) for you, to cleanse H2891 (8763) you, [that] ye may be clean H2891 (8799) from all your sins H2403 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
016:031 It [shall be] a sabbath H7676 of rest H7677 unto you, and ye shall afflict H6031 (8765) your souls H5315, by a statute H2708 for ever H5769.
016:032 And the priest H3548, whom he shall anoint H4886 (8799), and whom he shall consecrate H4390 (8762) H3027 to minister in the priest’s office H3547 (8763) in his father’s H0001 stead, shall make the atonement H3722 (8765), and shall put on H3847 (8804) the linen H0906 clothes H0899, [even] the holy H6944 garments H0899:
016:033 And he shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for the holy H6944 sanctuary H4720, and he shall make an atonement H3722 (8762) for the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and for the altar H4196, and he shall make an atonement H3722 (8762) for the priests H3548, and for all the people H5971 of the congregation H6951.
016:034 And this shall be an everlasting H5769 statute H2708 unto you, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 for all their sins H2403 once H0259 a year H8141. And he did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
017:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
017:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175, and unto his sons H1121, and unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them; This [is] the thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800),
017:003 What H0376 man H0376 soever [there be] of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, that killeth H7819 (8799) an ox H7794, or lamb H3775, or goat H5795, in the camp H4264, or that killeth H7819 (8799) [it] out H2351 of the camp H4264,
017:004 And bringeth H0935 (8689) it not unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, to offer H7126 (8687) an offering H7133 unto the LORD H3068 before H6440 the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068; blood H1818 shall be imputed H2803 (8735) unto that man H0376; he hath shed H8210 (8804) blood H1818; and that man H0376 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among H7130 his people H5971:
017:005 To the end that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 may bring H0935 (8686) their sacrifices H2077, which they offer H2076 (8802) in the open H6440 field H7704, even that they may bring H0935 (8689) them unto the LORD H3068, unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, unto the priest H3548, and offer H2076 (8804) them [for] peace H8002 offerings H2077 unto the LORD H3068.
017:006 And the priest H3548 shall sprinkle H2236 (8804) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 [at] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and burn H6999 (8689) the fat H2459 for a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
017:007 And they shall no more offer H2076 (8799) their sacrifices H2077 unto devils H8163, after H0310 whom they have gone a whoring H2181 (8802). This shall be a statute H2708 for ever H5769 unto them throughout their generations H1755.
017:008 And thou shalt say H0559 (8799) unto them, Whatsoever man H0376 [there be] of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, or of the strangers H1616 which sojourn H1481 (8799) among H8432 you, that offereth H5927 (8686) a burnt offering H5930 or sacrifice H2077,
017:009 And bringeth H0935 (8686) it not unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, to offer H6213 (8800) it unto the LORD H3068; even that man H0376 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among his people H5971.
017:010 And whatsoever man H0376 [there be] of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, or of the strangers H1616 that sojourn H1481 (8802) among H8432 you, that eateth H0398 (8799) any manner of blood H1818; I will even set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 against that soul H5315 that eateth H0398 (8802) blood H1818, and will cut him off H3772 (8689) from among H7130 his people H5971.
017:011 For the life H5315 of the flesh H1320 [is] in the blood H1818: and I have given H5414 (8804) it to you upon the altar H4196 to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for your souls H5315: for it [is] the blood H1818 [that] maketh an atonement H3722 (8762) for the soul H5315.
017:012 Therefore I said H0559 (8804) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, No soul H5315 of you shall eat H0398 (8799) blood H1818, neither shall any stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 you eat H0398 (8799) blood H1818.
017:013 And whatsoever man H0376 [there be] of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, or of the strangers H1616 that sojourn H1481 (8802) among H8432 you, which hunteth H6679 (8799) and catcheth H6718 any beast H2416 or fowl H5775 that may be eaten H0398 (8735); he shall even pour H8210 (8804) out the blood H1818 thereof, and cover H3680 (8765) it with dust H6083.
017:014 For [it is] the life H5315 of all flesh H1320; the blood H1818 of it [is] for the life H5315 thereof: therefore I said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, Ye shall eat H0398 (8799) the blood H1818 of no manner of flesh H1320: for the life H5315 of all flesh H1320 [is] the blood H1818 thereof: whosoever eateth H0398 (8802) it shall be cut off H3772 (8735).
017:015 And every soul H5315 that eateth H0398 (8799) that which died H5038 [of itself], or that which was torn H2966 [with beasts, whether it be] one of your own country H0249, or a stranger H1616, he shall both wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) [himself] in water H4325, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153: then shall he be clean H2891 (8804).
017:016 But if he wash H3526 (8762) [them] not, nor bathe H7364 (8799) his flesh H1320; then he shall bear H5375 (8804) his iniquity H5771.
018:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
018:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, I am the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
018:003 After the doings H4639 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, wherein ye dwelt H3427 (8804), shall ye not do H6213 (8799): and after the doings H4639 of the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, whither I bring H0935 (8688) you, shall ye not do H6213 (8799): neither shall ye walk H3212 (8799) in their ordinances H2708.
018:004 Ye shall do H6213 (8799) my judgments H4941, and keep H8104 (8799) mine ordinances H2708, to walk H3212 (8800) therein: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
018:005 Ye shall therefore keep H8104 (8804) my statutes H2708, and my judgments H4941: which H0834 if a man H0120 do H6213 (8799), he shall live H2425 (8804) in them: I [am] the LORD H3068.
018:006 None of you shall approach H7126 (8799) to any H0376 that is near H7607 of kin H1320 to him, to uncover H1540 (8763) [their] nakedness H6172: I [am] the LORD H3068.
018:007 The nakedness H6172 of thy father H0001, or the nakedness H6172 of thy mother H0517, shalt thou not uncover H1540 (8762): she [is] thy mother H0517; thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) her nakedness H6172.
018:008 The nakedness H6172 of thy father’s H0001 wife H0802 shalt thou not uncover H1540 (8762): it [is] thy father’s H0001 nakedness H6172.
018:009 The nakedness H6172 of thy sister H0269, the daughter H1323 of thy father H0001, or daughter H1323 of thy mother H0517, [whether she be] born H4138 at home H1004, or born H4138 abroad H2351, [even] their nakedness H6172 thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762).
018:010 The nakedness H6172 of thy son’s H1121 daughter H1323, or of thy daughter’s H1323 daughter H1323, [even] their nakedness H6172 thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762): for theirs H2007 [is] thine own nakedness H6172.
018:011 The nakedness H6172 of thy father’s H0001 wife’s H0802 daughter H1323, begotten H4138 of thy father H0001, she [is] thy sister H0269, thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) her nakedness H6172.
018:012 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy father’s H0001 sister H0269: she [is] thy father’s H0001 near kinswoman H7607.
018:013 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy mother’s H0517 sister H0269: for she [is] thy mother’s H0517 near kinswoman H7607.
018:014 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy father’s H0001 brother H0251, thou shalt not approach H7126 (8799) to his wife H0802: she [is] thine aunt H1733.
018:015 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy daughter in law H3618: she [is] thy son’s H1121 wife H0802; thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) her nakedness H6172.
018:016 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy brother’s H0251 wife H0802: it [is] thy brother’s H0251 nakedness H6172.
018:017 Thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of a woman H0802 and her daughter H1323, neither shalt thou take H3947 (8799) her son’s H1121 daughter H1323, or her daughter’s H1323 daughter H1323, to uncover H1540 (8763) her nakedness H6172; [for] they [are] her near kinswomen H7608: it [is] wickedness H2154.
018:018 Neither shalt thou take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 to her sister H0269, to vex H6887 (8800) [her], to uncover H1540 (8763) her nakedness H6172, beside the other in her life H2416 [time].
018:019 Also thou shalt not approach H7126 (8799) unto a woman H0802 to uncover H1540 (8763) her nakedness H6172, as long as she is put apart H5079 for her uncleanness H2932.
018:020 Moreover thou shalt not H5414 (8799) lie H7903 carnally H2233 with thy neighbour’s H5997 wife H0802, to defile H2930 (8800) thyself with her.
018:021 And thou shalt not H5414 (8799) let any of thy seed H2233 pass H5674 (8687) through [the fire] to Molech H4432, neither shalt thou profane H2490 (8762) the name H8034 of thy God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
018:022 Thou shalt not lie H7901 (8799) with mankind H2145, as with H4904 womankind H0802: it [is] abomination H8441.
018:023 Neither shalt thou H5414 (8799) lie H7903 with any beast H0929 to defile H2930 (8800) thyself therewith: neither shall any woman H0802 stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 a beast H0929 to lie down H7250 (8800) thereto: it [is] confusion H8397.
018:024 Defile H2930 (8691) not ye yourselves in any of these things H0428: for in all these the nations H1471 are defiled H2930 (8738) which I cast out H7971 (8764) before H6440 you:
018:025 And the land H0776 is defiled H2930 (8799): therefore I do visit H6485 (8799) the iniquity H5771 thereof upon it, and the land H0776 itself vomiteth out H6958 (8686) her inhabitants H3427 (8802).
018:026 Ye shall therefore keep H8104 (8804) my statutes H2708 and my judgments H4941, and shall not commit H6213 (8799) [any] of these abominations H8441; [neither] any of your own nation H0249, nor any stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 you:
018:027 (For all these H0411 abominations H8441 have the men H0582 of the land H0776 done H6213 (8804), which [were] before H6440 you, and the land H0776 is defiled H2930 (8799);)
018:028 That the land H0776 spue not you out H6958 (8686) also, when ye defile H2930 (8763) it, as it spued out H6958 (8804) the nations H1471 that [were] before H6440 you.
018:029 For whosoever shall commit H6213 (8799) any of these abominations H8441, even the souls H5315 that commit H6213 (8802) [them] shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among H7130 their people H5971.
018:030 Therefore shall ye keep H8104 (8804) mine ordinance H4931, that [ye] commit H6213 (8800) not [any one] of these abominable H8441 customs H2708, which were committed H6213 (8738) before H6440 you, and that ye defile H2930 (8691) not yourselves therein: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
019:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Ye shall be holy H6918: for I the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [am] holy H6918.
019:003 Ye shall fear H3372 (8799) every man H0376 his mother H0517, and his father H0001, and keep H8104 (8799) my sabbaths H7676: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:004 Turn H6437 (8799) ye not unto idols H0457, nor make H6213 (8799) to yourselves molten H4541 gods H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:005 And if ye offer H2076 (8799) a sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002 unto the LORD H3068, ye shall offer H2076 (8799) it at your own will H7522.
019:006 It shall be eaten H0398 (8735) the same day H3117 ye offer H2077 it, and on the morrow H4283: and if ought remain H3498 (8737) until the third H7992 day H3117, it shall be burnt H8313 (8735) in the fire H0784.
019:007 And if it be eaten H0398 (8735) at all H0398 (8736) on the third H7992 day H3117, it [is] abominable H6292; it shall not be accepted H7521 (8735).
019:008 Therefore [every one] that eateth H0398 (8802) it shall bear H5375 (8799) his iniquity H5771, because he hath profaned H2490 (8765) the hallowed thing H6944 of the LORD H3068: and that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among his people H5971.
019:009 And when ye reap H7114 (8800) the harvest H7105 of your land H0776, thou shalt not wholly reap H3615 (8762) the corners H6285 of thy field H7704, neither shalt thou gather H3950 (8762) the gleanings H3951 of thy harvest H7105.
019:010 And thou shalt not glean H5953 (8779) thy vineyard H3754, neither shalt thou gather H3950 (8762) [every] grape H6528 of thy vineyard H3754; thou shalt leave H5800 (8799) them for the poor H6041 and stranger H1616: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:011 Ye shall not steal H1589 (8799), neither deal falsely H3584 (8762), neither lie H8266 (8762) one H0376 to another H5997.
019:012 And ye shall not swear H7650 (8735) by my name H8034 falsely H8267, neither shalt thou profane H2490 (8765) the name H8034 of thy God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:013 Thou shalt not defraud H6231 (8799) thy neighbour H7453, neither rob H1497 (8799) [him]: the wages H6468 of him that is hired H7916 shall not abide H3885 (8799) with thee all night until the morning H1242.
019:014 Thou shalt not curse H7043 (8762) the deaf H2795, nor put H5414 (8799) a stumblingblock H4383 before H6440 the blind H5787, but shalt fear H3372 (8804) thy God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:015 Ye shall do H6213 (8799) no unrighteousness H5766 in judgment H4941: thou shalt not respect H5375 (8799) the person H6440 of the poor H1800, nor honour H1921 (8799) the person H6440 of the mighty H1419: [but] in righteousness H6664 shalt thou judge H8199 (8799) thy neighbour H5997.
019:016 Thou shalt not go H3212 (8799) up and down [as] a talebearer H7400 among thy people H5971: neither shalt thou stand H5975 (8799) against the blood H1818 of thy neighbour H7453: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:017 Thou shalt not hate H8130 (8799) thy brother H0251 in thine heart H3824: thou shalt in any wise H3198 (8687) rebuke H3198 (8686) thy neighbour H5997, and not suffer H5375 (8799) sin H2399 upon him.
019:018 Thou shalt not avenge H5358 (8799), nor bear any grudge H5201 (8799) against the children H1121 of thy people H5971, but thou shalt love H0157 (8804) thy neighbour H7453 as thyself H3644: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:019 Ye shall keep H8104 (8799) my statutes H2708. Thou shalt not let thy cattle H0929 gender H7250 (8686) with a diverse kind H3610: thou shalt not sow H2232 (8799) thy field H7704 with mingled seed H3610: neither shall a garment H0899 mingled H3610 of linen and woollen H8162 come H5927 (8799) upon thee.
019:020 And whosoever H0376 lieth H7901 (8799) carnally H2233 H7902 with a woman H0802, that [is] a bondmaid H8198, betrothed H2778 (8737) to an husband H0376, and not at all H6299 (8715) redeemed H6299 (8738), nor freedom H2668 given H5414 (8738) her; she shall be scourged H1244; they shall not be put to death H4191 (8714), because she was not free H2666 (8795).
019:021 And he shall bring H0935 (8689) his trespass offering H0817 unto the LORD H3068, unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, [even] a ram H0352 for a trespass offering H0817.
019:022 And the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him with the ram H0352 of the trespass offering H0817 before H6440 the LORD H3068 for his sin H2403 which he hath done H2398 (8804): and the sin H2403 which he hath done H2398 (8804) shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
019:023 And when ye shall come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776, and shall have planted H5193 (8804) all manner of trees H6086 for food H3978, then ye shall count H6188 the fruit H6529 thereof as uncircumcised H6188 (8804) H6190: three H7969 years H8141 shall it be as uncircumcised H6189 unto you: it shall not be eaten H0398 (8735) of.
019:024 But in the fourth H7243 year H8141 all the fruit H6529 thereof shall be holy H6944 to praise H1974 the LORD H3068 [withal].
019:025 And in the fifth H2549 year H8141 shall ye eat H0398 (8799) of the fruit H6529 thereof, that it may yield H3254 (8687) unto you the increase H8393 thereof: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:026 Ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) [any thing] with the blood H1818: neither shall ye use enchantment H5172 (8762), nor observe times H6049 (8779).
019:027 Ye shall not round H5362 (8686) the corners H6285 of your heads H7218, neither shalt thou mar H7843 (8686) the corners H6285 of thy beard H2206.
019:028 Ye shall not make H5414 (8799) any H3793 cuttings H8296 in your flesh H1320 for the dead H5315, nor print H5414 (8799) any marks H7085 upon you: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:029 Do not prostitute H2490 (8762) thy daughter H1323, to cause her to be a whore H2181 (8687); lest the land H0776 fall to whoredom H2181 (8799), and the land H0776 become full H4390 (8804) of wickedness H2154.
019:030 Ye shall keep H8104 (8799) my sabbaths H7676, and reverence H3372 (8799) my sanctuary H4720: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:031 Regard H6437 (8799) not them that have familiar spirits H0178, neither seek H1245 (8762) after wizards H3049, to be defiled H2930 (8800) by them: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:032 Thou shalt rise up H6965 (8799) before H6440 the hoary head H7872, and honour H1921 (8804) the face H6440 of the old man H2205, and fear H3372 (8804) thy God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
019:033 And if a stranger H1616 sojourn H1481 (8799) with thee in your land H0776, ye shall not vex H3238 (8686) him.
019:034 [But] the stranger H1616 that dwelleth H1481 (8802) with you shall be unto you as one born H0249 among you, and thou shalt love H0157 (8804) him as thyself; for ye were strangers H1616 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
019:035 Ye shall do H6213 (8799) no unrighteousness H5766 in judgment H4941, in meteyard H4060, in weight H4948, or in measure H4884.
019:036 Just H6664 balances H3976, just H6664 weights H0068, a just H6664 ephah H0374, and a just H6664 hin H1969, shall ye have: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which brought you out H3318 (8689) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
019:037 Therefore shall ye observe H8104 (8804) all my statutes H2708, and all my judgments H4941, and do H6213 (8804) them: I [am] the LORD H3068.
020:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
020:002 Again, thou shalt say H0559 (8799) to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, Whosoever H0376 [he be] of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, or of the strangers H1616 that sojourn H1481 (8802) in Israel H3478, that giveth H5414 (8799) [any] of his seed H2233 unto Molech H4432; he shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714): the people H5971 of the land H0776 shall stone H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068.
020:003 And I will set H5414 (8799) my face H6440 against that man H0376, and will cut him off H3772 (8689) from among H7130 his people H5971; because he hath given H5414 (8804) of his seed H2233 unto Molech H4432, to defile H2930 (8763) my sanctuary H4720, and to profane H2490 (8763) my holy H6944 name H8034.
020:004 And if the people H5971 of the land H0776 do any ways H5956 (8687) hide H5956 (8686) their eyes H5869 from the man H0376, when he giveth H5414 (8800) of his seed H2233 unto Molech H4432, and kill H4191 (8687) him not H1115:
020:005 Then I will set H7760 (8804) my face H6440 against that man H0376, and against his family H4940, and will cut him off H3772 (8689), and all that go a whoring H2181 (8802) after H0310 him, to commit whoredom H2181 (8800) with Molech H4432, from among H7130 their people H5971.
020:006 And the soul H5315 that turneth H6437 (8799) after H0413 such as have familiar spirits H0178, and after H0310 wizards H3049, to go a whoring H2181 (8800) after H0310 them, I will even set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 against that soul H5315, and will cut him off H3772 (8689) from among H7130 his people H5971.
020:007 Sanctify H6942 (8694) yourselves therefore, and be ye holy H6918: for I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
020:008 And ye shall keep H8104 (8804) my statutes H2708, and do H6213 (8804) them: I [am] the LORD H3068 which sanctify H6942 (8764) you.
020:009 For every H0376 one H0376 that curseth H7043 (8762) his father H0001 or his mother H0517 shall be surely H4191 (8800) put to death H4191 (8714): he hath cursed H7043 (8765) his father H0001 or his mother H0517; his blood H1818 [shall be] upon him.
020:010 And the man H0376 that committeth adultery H5003 (8799) with [another] man’s H0376 wife H0802, [even he] that committeth adultery H5003 (8799) with his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802, the adulterer H5003 (8802) and the adulteress H5003 (8802) shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
020:011 And the man H0376 that lieth H7901 (8799) with his father’s H0001 wife H0802 hath uncovered H1540 (8765) his father’s H0001 nakedness H6172: both H8147 of them shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714); their blood H1818 [shall be] upon them.
020:012 And if a man H0376 lie H7901 (8799) with his daughter in law H3618, both H8147 of them shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714): they have wrought H6213 (8804) confusion H8397; their blood H1818 [shall be] upon them.
020:013 If a man H0376 also lie H7901 (8799) with mankind H2145, as he lieth H4904 with a woman H0802, both H8147 of them have committed H6213 (8804) an abomination H8441: they shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714); their blood H1818 [shall be] upon them.
020:014 And if a man H0376 take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 and her mother H0517, it [is] wickedness H2154: they shall be burnt H8313 (8799) with fire H0784, both he and they; that there be no wickedness H2154 among H8432 you.
020:015 And if a man H0376 lie H5414 (8799) H7903 with a beast H0929, he shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714): and ye shall slay H2026 (8799) the beast H0929.
020:016 And if a woman H0802 approach H7126 (8799) unto any beast H0929, and lie down H7250 (8800) thereto, thou shalt kill H2026 (8804) the woman H0802, and the beast H0929: they shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714); their blood H1818 [shall be] upon them.
020:017 And if a man H0376 shall take H3947 (8799) his sister H0269, his father’s H0001 daughter H1323, or H0176 his mother’s H0517 daughter H1323, and see H7200 (8804) her nakedness H6172, and she see H7200 (8799) his nakedness H6172; it [is] a wicked thing H2617; and they shall be cut off H3772 (8738) in the sight H5869 of their people H5971 H1121: he hath uncovered H1540 (8765) his sister’s H0269 nakedness H6172; he shall bear H5375 (8799) his iniquity H5771.
020:018 And if a man H0376 shall lie H7901 (8799) with a woman H0802 having her sickness H1739, and shall uncover H1540 (8765) her nakedness H6172; he hath discovered H6168 (8689) her fountain H4726, and she hath uncovered H1540 (8765) the fountain H4726 of her blood H1818: and both H8147 of them shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among H7130 their people H5971.
020:019 And thou shalt not uncover H1540 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of thy mother’s H0517 sister H0269, nor of thy father’s H0001 sister H0269: for he uncovereth H6168 (8689) his near kin H7607: they shall bear H5375 (8799) their iniquity H5771.
020:020 And if a man H0376 shall lie H7901 (8799) with his uncle’s wife H1733, he hath uncovered H1540 (8765) his uncle’s H1730 nakedness H6172: they shall bear H5375 (8799) their sin H2399; they shall die H4191 (8799) childless H6185.
020:021 And if a man H0376 shall take H3947 (8799) his brother’s H0251 wife H0802, it [is] an unclean thing H5079: he hath uncovered H1540 (8765) his brother’s H0251 nakedness H6172; they shall be childless H6185.
020:022 Ye shall therefore keep H8104 (8804) all my statutes H2708, and all my judgments H4941, and do H6213 (8804) them: that the land H0776, whither I bring H0935 (8688) you to dwell H3427 (8800) therein, spue you not out H6958 (8686).
020:023 And ye shall not walk H3212 (8799) in the manners H2708 of the nation H1471, which I cast out H7971 (8764) before H6440 you: for they committed H6213 (8804) all these things, and therefore I abhorred H6973 (8799) them.
020:024 But I have said H0559 (8799) unto you, Ye shall inherit H3423 (8799) their land H0127, and I will give H5414 (8799) it unto you to possess H3423 (8800) it, a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which have separated H0914 (8689) you from [other] people H5971.
020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference H0914 (8689) between clean H2889 beasts H0929 and unclean H2931, and between unclean H2931 fowls H5775 and clean H2889: and ye shall not make your souls H5315 abominable H8262 (8762) by beast H0929, or by fowl H5775, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth H7430 (8799) on the ground H0127, which I have separated H0914 (8689) from you as unclean H2930 (8763).
020:026 And ye shall be holy H6918 unto me: for I the LORD H3068 [am] holy H6918, and have severed H0914 (8686) you from [other] people H5971, that ye should be mine.
020:027 A man H0376 also or woman H0802 that hath H3588 a familiar spirit H0178, or that is a wizard H3049, shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714): they shall stone H7275 (8799) them with stones H0068: their blood H1818 [shall be] upon them.
021:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Speak H0559 (8798) unto the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, There shall none be defiled H2930 (8691) for the dead H5315 among his people H5971:
021:002 But for his kin H7607, that is near H7138 unto him, [that is], for his mother H0517, and for his father H0001, and for his son H1121, and for his daughter H1323, and for his brother H0251,
021:003 And for his sister H0269 a virgin H1330, that is nigh H7138 unto him, which hath had no husband H0376; for her may he be defiled H2930 (8691).
021:004 [But] he shall not defile H2930 (8691) himself, [being] a chief man H1167 among his people H5971, to profane H2490 (8736) himself.
021:005 They shall not make H7139 (8799) baldness H7144 upon their head H7218, neither shall they shave off H1548 (8762) the corner H6285 of their beard H2206, nor make H8295 (8799) any cuttings H8296 in their flesh H1320.
021:006 They shall be holy H6944 unto their God H0430, and not profane H2490 (8762) the name H8034 of their God H0430: for the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801, [and] the bread H3899 of their God H0430, they do offer H7126 (8688): therefore they shall be holy H6918.
021:007 They shall not take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 [that is] a whore H2181 (8802), or profane H2491; neither shall they take H3947 (8799) a woman H0802 put away H1644 (8803) from her husband H0376: for he [is] holy H6918 unto his God H0430.
021:008 Thou shalt sanctify H6942 (8765) him therefore; for he offereth H7126 (8688) the bread H3899 of thy God H0430: he shall be holy H6918 unto thee: for I the LORD H3068, which sanctify H6942 (8764) you, [am] holy H6918.
021:009 And the daughter H1323 of any H0376 priest H3548, if she profane H2490 (8735) herself by playing the whore H2181 (8800), she profaneth H2490 (8764) her father H0001: she shall be burnt H8313 (8735) with fire H0784.
021:010 And [he that is] the high H1419 priest H3548 among his brethren H0251, upon whose head H7218 the anointing H4888 oil H8081 was poured H3332 (8714), and that is consecrated H4390 (8765) H3027 to put H3847 (8800) on the garments H0899, shall not uncover H6544 (8799) his head H7218, nor rend H6533 (8799) his clothes H0899;
021:011 Neither shall he go in H0935 (8799) to any dead H4191 (8801) body H5315, nor defile H2930 (8691) himself for his father H0001, or for his mother H0517;
021:012 Neither shall he go out H3318 (8799) of the sanctuary H4720, nor profane H2490 (8762) the sanctuary H4720 of his God H0430; for the crown H5145 of the anointing H4888 oil H8081 of his God H0430 [is] upon him: I [am] the LORD H3068.
021:013 And he shall take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 in her virginity H1331.
021:014 A widow H0490, or a divorced woman H1644 (8803), or profane H2491, [or] an harlot H2181 (8802), these shall he not take H3947 (8799): but he shall take H3947 (8799) a virgin H1330 of his own people H5971 to wife H0802.
021:015 Neither shall he profane H2490 (8762) his seed H2233 among his people H5971: for I the LORD H3068 do sanctify H6942 (8764) him.
021:016 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
021:017 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800), Whosoever H0376 [he be] of thy seed H2233 in their generations H1755 that hath [any] blemish H3971, let him not approach H7126 (8799) to offer H7126 (8687) the bread H3899 of his God H0430.
021:018 For whatsoever man H0376 [he be] that hath a blemish H3971, he shall not approach H7126 (8799): a blind H5787 man H0376, or a lame H6455, or he that hath a flat nose H2763 (8803), or any thing superfluous H8311 (8803),
021:019 Or a man H0376 that is brokenfooted H7667 H7272, or brokenhanded H7667 H3027,
021:020 Or crookbackt H1384, or a dwarf H1851, or that hath a blemish H8400 in his eye H5869, or be scurvy H1618, or scabbed H3217, or hath his stones H0810 broken H4790;
021:021 No man H0376 that hath a blemish H3971 of the seed H2233 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548 shall come nigh H5066 (8799) to offer H7126 (8687) the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801: he hath a blemish H3971; he shall not come nigh H5066 (8799) to offer H7126 (8687) the bread H3899 of his God H0430.
021:022 He shall eat H0398 (8799) the bread H3899 of his God H0430, [both] of the most H6944 holy H6944, and of the holy H6944.
021:023 Only he shall not go in H0935 (8799) unto the vail H6532, nor come nigh H5066 (8799) unto the altar H4196, because he hath a blemish H3971; that he profane H2490 (8762) not my sanctuaries H4720: for I the LORD H3068 do sanctify H6942 (8764) them.
021:024 And Moses H4872 told H1696 (8762) [it] unto Aaron H0175, and to his sons H1121, and unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
022:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
022:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175 and to his sons H1121, that they separate H5144 (8735) themselves from the holy things H6944 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and that they profane H2490 (8762) not my holy H6944 name H8034 [in those things] which they hallow H6942 (8688) unto me: I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:003 Say H0559 (8798) unto them, Whosoever H0376 [he be] of all your seed H2233 among your generations H1755, that goeth H7126 (8799) unto the holy things H6944, which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 hallow H6942 (8686) unto the LORD H3068, having his uncleanness H2932 upon him, that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from my presence H6440: I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:004 What man soever H0376 of the seed H2233 of Aaron H0175 [is] a leper H6879 (8803), or hath a running issue H2100 (8802); he shall not eat H0398 (8799) of the holy things H6944, until he be clean H2891 (8799). And whoso toucheth H5060 (8802) any thing [that is] unclean H2931 [by] the dead H5315, or a man H0376 whose seed H2233 H7902 goeth H3318 (8799) from him;
022:005 Or whosoever H0376 toucheth H5060 (8799) any creeping thing H8318, whereby he may be made unclean H2930 (8799), or a man H0120 of whom he may take uncleanness H2930 (8799), whatsoever uncleanness H2932 he hath;
022:006 The soul H5315 which hath touched H5060 (8799) any such shall be unclean H2930 (8804) until even H6153, and shall not eat H0398 (8799) of the holy things H6944, unless H0518 he wash H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 with water H4325.
022:007 And when the sun H8121 is down H0935 (8804), he shall be clean H2891 (8804), and shall afterward H0310 eat H0398 (8799) of the holy things H6944; because it [is] his food H3899.
022:008 That which dieth of itself H5038, or is torn H2966 [with beasts], he shall not eat H0398 (8799) to defile H2930 (8800) himself therewith: I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:009 They shall therefore keep H8104 (8804) mine ordinance H4931, lest they bear H5375 (8799) sin H2399 for it, and die H4191 (8804) therefore, if they profane H2490 (8762) it: I the LORD H3068 do sanctify H6942 (8764) them.
022:010 There shall no stranger H2114 (8801) eat H0398 (8799) [of] the holy thing H6944: a sojourner H8453 of the priest H3548, or an hired servant H7916, shall not eat H0398 (8799) [of] the holy thing H6944.
022:011 But if the priest H3548 buy H7069 (8799) [any] soul H5315 with H7075 his money H3701, he shall eat H0398 (8799) of it, and he that is born H3211 in his house H1004: they shall eat H0398 (8799) of his meat H3899.
022:012 If the priest’s H3548 daughter H1323 also be [married] unto a stranger H0376 H2114 (8801), she may not eat H0398 (8799) of an offering H8641 of the holy things H6944.
022:013 But if the priest’s H3548 daughter H1323 be a widow H0490, or divorced H1644 (8803), and have no child H2233, and is returned H7725 (8804) unto her father’s H0001 house H1004, as in her youth H5271, she shall eat H0398 (8799) of her father’s H0001 meat H3899: but there shall no stranger H2114 (8801) eat H0398 (8799) thereof.
022:014 And if a man H0376 eat H0398 (8799) [of] the holy thing H6944 unwittingly H7684, then he shall put H3254 (8804) the fifth H2549 [part] thereof unto it, and shall give H5414 (8804) [it] unto the priest H3548 with the holy thing H6944.
022:015 And they shall not profane H2490 (8762) the holy things H6944 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which they offer H7311 (8686) unto the LORD H3068;
022:016 Or suffer them to bear H5375 (8689) the iniquity H5771 of trespass H0819, when they eat H0398 (8800) their holy things H6944: for I the LORD H3068 do sanctify H6942 (8764) them.
022:017 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
022:018 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175, and to his sons H1121, and unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, Whatsoever H0376 [he be] of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, or of the strangers H1616 in Israel H3478, that will offer H7126 (8686) his oblation H7133 for all his vows H5088, and for all his freewill offerings H5071, which they will offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 for a burnt offering H5930;
022:019 [Ye shall offer] at your own will H7522 a male H2145 without blemish H8549, of the beeves H1241, of the sheep H3775, or of the goats H5795.
022:020 [But] whatsoever hath a blemish H3971, [that] shall ye not offer H7126 (8686): for it shall not be acceptable H7522 for you.
022:021 And whosoever H0376 offereth H7126 (8686) a sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002 unto the LORD H3068 to accomplish H6381 (8763) [his] vow H5088, or a freewill offering H5071 in beeves H1241 or sheep H6629, it shall be perfect H8549 to be accepted H7522; there shall be no blemish H3971 therein.
022:022 Blind H5788, or broken H7665 (8803), or maimed H2782 (8803), or having a wen H2990, or scurvy H1618, or scabbed H3217, ye shall not offer H7126 (8686) these unto the LORD H3068, nor make H5414 (8799) an offering by fire H0801 of them upon the altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068.
022:023 Either a bullock H7794 or a lamb H7716 that hath any thing superfluous H8311 (8803) or lacking in his parts H7038 (8803), that mayest thou offer H6213 (8799) [for] a freewill offering H5071; but for a vow H5088 it shall not be accepted H7521 (8735).
022:024 Ye shall not offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 that which is bruised H4600 (8803), or crushed H3807 (8803), or broken H5423 (8803), or cut H3772 (8803); neither shall ye make H6213 (8799) [any offering thereof] in your land H0776.
022:025 Neither from a stranger’s H5236 hand H3027 H1121 shall ye offer H7126 (8686) the bread H3899 of your God H0430 of any of these; because their corruption H4893 [is] in them, [and] blemishes H3971 [be] in them: they shall not be accepted H7521 (8735) for you.
022:026 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
022:027 When a bullock H7794, or a sheep H3775, or a goat H5795, is brought forth H3205 (8735), then it shall be seven H7651 days H3117 under the dam H0517; and from the eighth H8066 day H3117 and thenceforth H1973 it shall be accepted H7521 (8735) for an offering H7133 made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
022:028 And [whether it be] cow H7794 or ewe H7716, ye shall not kill H7819 (8799) it and her young H1121 both in one H0259 day H3117.
022:029 And when ye will offer H2076 (8799) a sacrifice H2077 of thanksgiving H8426 unto the LORD H3068, offer H2076 (8799) [it] at your own will H7522.
022:030 On the same day H3117 it shall be eaten up H0398 (8735); ye shall leave H3498 (8686) none of it until the morrow H1242: I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:031 Therefore shall ye keep H8104 (8804) my commandments H4687, and do H6213 (8804) them: I [am] the LORD H3068.
022:032 Neither shall ye profane H2490 (8762) my holy H6944 name H8034; but I will be hallowed H6942 (8738) among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478: I [am] the LORD H3068 which hallow H6942 (8762) you,
022:033 That brought you out H3318 (8688) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, to be your God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
023:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
023:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, [Concerning] the feasts H4150 of the LORD H3068, which ye shall proclaim H7121 (8799) [to be] holy H6944 convocations H4744, [even] these [are] my feasts H4150.
023:003 Six H8337 days H3117 shall work H4399 be done H6213 (8735): but the seventh H7637 day H3117 [is] the sabbath H7676 of rest H7677, an holy H6944 convocation H4744; ye shall do H6213 (8799) no work H4399 [therein]: it [is] the sabbath H7676 of the LORD H3068 in all your dwellings H4186.
023:004 These [are] the feasts H4150 of the LORD H3068, [even] holy H6944 convocations H4744, which ye shall proclaim H7121 (8799) in their seasons H4150.
023:005 In the fourteenth H0702 H6240 [day] of the first H7223 month H2320 at even H6153 [is] the LORD’S H3068 passover H6453.
023:006 And on the fifteenth H2568 H6240 day H3117 of the same month H2320 [is] the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682 unto the LORD H3068: seven H7651 days H3117 ye must eat H0398 (8799) unleavened bread H4682.
023:007 In the first H7223 day H3117 ye shall have an holy H6944 convocation H4744: ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 therein.
023:008 But ye shall offer H7126 (8689) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068 seven H7651 days H3117: in the seventh H7637 day H3117 [is] an holy H6944 convocation H4744: ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 [therein].
023:009 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
023:010 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye be come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 which I give H5414 (8802) unto you, and shall reap H7114 (8804) the harvest H7105 thereof, then ye shall bring H0935 (8689) a sheaf H6016 of the firstfruits H7225 of your harvest H7105 unto the priest H3548:
023:011 And he shall wave H5130 (8689) the sheaf H6016 before H6440 the LORD H3068, to be accepted H7522 for you: on the morrow H4283 after the sabbath H7676 the priest H3548 shall wave H5130 (8686) it.
023:012 And ye shall offer H6213 (8804) that day H3117 when ye wave H5130 (8687) the sheaf H6016 an he lamb H3532 without blemish H8549 of the first H1121 year H8141 for a burnt offering H5930 unto the LORD H3068.
023:013 And the meat offering H4503 thereof [shall be] two H8147 tenth deals H6241 of fine flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068 [for] a sweet H5207 savour H7381: and the drink offering H5262 thereof [shall be] of wine H3196, the fourth H7243 [part] of an hin H1969.
023:014 And ye shall eat H0398 (8799) neither bread H3899, nor parched corn H7039, nor green ears H3759, until the selfsame H6106 H2088 day H3117 that H5704 ye have brought H0935 (8687) an offering H7133 unto your God H0430: [it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 throughout your generations H1755 in all your dwellings H4186.
023:015 And ye shall count H5608 (8804) unto you from the morrow H4283 after the sabbath H7676, from the day H3117 that ye brought H0935 (8687) the sheaf H6016 of the wave offering H8573; seven H7651 sabbaths H7676 shall be H1961 (8799) complete H8549:
023:016 Even unto H5704 the morrow H4283 after the seventh H7637 sabbath H7676 shall ye number H5608 (8799) fifty H2572 days H3117; and ye shall offer H7126 (8689) a new H2319 meat offering H4503 unto the LORD H3068.
023:017 Ye shall bring out H0935 (8686) of your habitations H4186 two H8147 wave H8573 loaves H3899 of two H8147 tenth deals H6241: they shall be of fine flour H5560; they shall be baken H0644 (8735) with leaven H2557; [they are] the firstfruits H1061 unto the LORD H3068.
023:018 And ye shall offer H7126 (8689) with the bread H3899 seven H7651 lambs H3532 without blemish H8549 of the first H1121 year H8141, and one H0259 young H1241 H1121 bullock H6499, and two H8147 rams H0352: they shall be [for] a burnt offering H5930 unto the LORD H3068, with their meat offering H4503, and their drink offerings H5262, [even] an offering made by fire H0801, of sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice H6213 (8804) one H0259 kid H8163 of the goats H5795 for a sin offering H2403, and two H8147 lambs H3532 of the first H1121 year H8141 for a sacrifice H2077 of peace offerings H8002.
023:020 And the priest H3548 shall wave H5130 (8689) them with the bread H3899 of the firstfruits H1061 [for] a wave offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068, with the two H8147 lambs H3532: they shall be holy H6944 to the LORD H3068 for the priest H3548.
023:021 And ye shall proclaim H7121 (8804) on the selfsame H6106 day H3117, [that] it may be an holy H6944 convocation H4744 unto you: ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 [therein: it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 in all your dwellings H4186 throughout your generations H1755.
023:022 And when ye reap H7114 (8800) the harvest H7105 of your land H0776, thou shalt not make clean riddance H3615 (8762) of the corners H6285 of thy field H7704 when thou reapest H7114 (8800), neither shalt thou gather H3950 (8762) any gleaning H3951 of thy harvest H7105: thou shalt leave H5800 (8799) them unto the poor H6041, and to the stranger H1616: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
023:023 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
023:024 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), In the seventh H7637 month H2320, in the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, shall ye have a sabbath H7677, a memorial H2146 of blowing H8643 of trumpets, an holy H6944 convocation H4744.
023:025 Ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 [therein]: but ye shall offer H7126 (8689) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
023:026 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
023:027 Also H0389 on the tenth H6218 [day] of this seventh H7637 month H2320 [there shall be] a day H3117 of atonement H3725: it shall be an holy H6944 convocation H4744 unto you; and ye shall afflict H6031 (8765) your souls H5315, and offer H7126 (8689) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
023:028 And ye shall do H6213 (8799) no work H4399 in that same H6106 day H3117: for it [is] a day H3117 of atonement H3725, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for you before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
023:029 For whatsoever soul H5315 [it be] that shall not be afflicted H6031 (8792) in that same H6106 day H3117, he shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among his people H5971.
023:030 And whatsoever soul H5315 [it be] that doeth H6213 (8799) any work H4399 in that same H6106 day H3117, the same soul H5315 will I destroy H0006 (8689) from among H7130 his people H5971.
023:031 Ye shall do H6213 (8799) no manner of work H4399: [it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 throughout your generations H1755 in all your dwellings H4186.
023:032 It [shall be] unto you a sabbath H7676 of rest H7677, and ye shall afflict H6031 (8765) your souls H5315: in the ninth H8672 [day] of the month H2320 at even H6153, from even H6153 unto even H6153, shall ye celebrate H7673 (8799) your sabbath H7676.
023:033 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
023:034 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The fifteenth H2568 H6240 day H3117 of this seventh H7637 month H2320 [shall be] the feast H2282 of tabernacles H5521 [for] seven H7651 days H3117 unto the LORD H3068.
023:035 On the first H7223 day H3117 [shall be] an holy H6944 convocation H4744: ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 [therein].
023:036 Seven H7651 days H3117 ye shall offer H7126 (8689) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068: on the eighth H8066 day H3117 shall be an holy H6944 convocation H4744 unto you; and ye shall offer H7126 (8686) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068: it [is] a solemn assembly H6116; [and] ye shall do H6213 (8799) no servile H5656 work H4399 [therein].
023:037 These [are] the feasts H4150 of the LORD H3068, which ye shall proclaim H7121 (8799) [to be] holy H6944 convocations H4744, to offer H7126 (8687) an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068, a burnt offering H5930, and a meat offering H4503, a sacrifice H2077, and drink offerings H5262, every thing H1697 upon his H3117 day H3117:
023:038 Beside the sabbaths H7676 of the LORD H3068, and beside your gifts H4979, and beside all your vows H5088, and beside all your freewill offerings H5071, which ye give H5414 (8799) unto the LORD H3068.
023:039 Also in the fifteenth H2568 H6240 day H3117 of the seventh H7637 month H2320, when ye have gathered H0622 (8800) in the fruit H8393 of the land H0776, ye shall keep H2287 (8799) a feast H2282 unto the LORD H3068 seven H7651 days H3117: on the first H7223 day H3117 [shall be] a sabbath H7677, and on the eighth H8066 day H3117 [shall be] a sabbath H7677.
023:040 And ye shall take H3947 (8804) you on the first H7223 day H3117 the boughs H6529 of goodly H1926 trees H6086, branches H3709 of palm H8558 trees, and the boughs H6057 of thick H5687 trees H6086, and willows H6155 of the brook H5158; and ye shall rejoice H8055 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430 seven H7651 days H3117.
023:041 And ye shall keep H2287 (8804) it a feast H2282 unto the LORD H3068 seven H7651 days H3117 in the year H8141. [It shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 in your generations H1755: ye shall celebrate H2287 (8799) it in the seventh H7637 month H2320.
023:042 Ye shall dwell H3427 (8799) in booths H5521 seven H7651 days H3117; all that are Israelites H3478 born H0249 shall dwell H3427 (8799) in booths H5521:
023:043 That your generations H1755 may know H3045 (8799) that I made the children H1121 of Israel H3478 to dwell H3427 (8689) in booths H5521, when I brought them out H3318 (8687) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
023:044 And Moses H4872 declared H1696 (8762) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 the feasts H4150 of the LORD H3068.
024:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
024:002 Command H6680 (8761) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they bring H3947 (8799) unto thee pure H2134 oil H8081 olive H2132 beaten H3795 for the light H3974, to cause the lamps H5216 to burn H5927 (8687) continually H8548.
024:003 Without H2351 the vail H6532 of the testimony H5715, in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, shall Aaron H0175 order H6186 (8799) it from the evening H6153 unto the morning H1242 before H6440 the LORD H3068 continually H8548: [it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 in your generations H1755.
024:004 He shall order H6186 (8799) the lamps H5216 upon the pure H2889 candlestick H4501 before H6440 the LORD H3068 continually H8548.
024:005 And thou shalt take H3947 (8804) fine flour H5560, and bake H0644 (8804) twelve H6240 cakes H2471 thereof: two H8147 tenth deals H6241 shall be in one H0259 cake H2471.
024:006 And thou shalt set H7760 (8804) them in two H8147 rows H4634, six H8337 on a row H4635, upon the pure H2889 table H7979 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
024:007 And thou shalt put H5414 (8804) pure H2134 frankincense H3828 upon [each] row H4635, that it may be on the bread H3899 for a memorial H0234, [even] an offering made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068.
024:008 Every sabbath H7676 he shall set it H3117 in order H6186 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068 continually H8548, [being taken] from the children H1121 of Israel H3478 by an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285.
024:009 And it shall be Aaron’s H0175 and his sons H1121 ’; and they shall eat H0398 (8804) it in the holy H6918 place H4725: for it [is] most H6944 holy H6944 unto him of the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801 by a perpetual H5769 statute H2706.
024:010 And the son H1121 of an Israelitish H3482 woman H0802, whose father H1121 [was] an Egyptian H0376 H4713, went out H3318 (8799) among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 H3481: and this son H1121 of the Israelitish H3482 [woman] and a man H0376 of Israel H3478 strove together H5327 (8735) in the camp H4264;
024:011 And the Israelitish H3482 woman’s H0802 son H1121 blasphemed H5344 (8799) the name H8034 [of the LORD], and cursed H7043 (8762). And they brought H0935 (8686) him unto Moses H4872: (and his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Shelomith H8019, the daughter H1323 of Dibri H1704, of the tribe H4294 of Dan H1835:)
024:012 And they put H3240 (8686) him in ward H4929, that the mind H6310 of the LORD H3068 might be shewed H6567 (8800) them.
024:013 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
024:014 Bring forth H3318 (8685) him that hath cursed H7043 (8764) without H2351 the camp H4264; and let all that heard H8085 (8802) [him] lay H5564 (8804) their hands H3027 upon his head H7218, and let all the congregation H5712 stone H7275 (8804) him.
024:015 And thou shalt speak H1696 (8762) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Whosoever H0376 curseth H3588 H7043 (8762) his God H0430 shall bear H5375 (8804) his sin H2399.
024:016 And he that blasphemeth H5344 (8802) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, he shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714), [and] all the congregation H5712 shall certainly H7275 (8800) stone H7275 (8799) him: as well the stranger H1616, as he that is born in the land H0249, when he blasphemeth H5344 (8800) the name H8034 [of the LORD], shall be put to death H4191 (8714).
024:017 And he H0376 that killeth H5221 (8686) any H5315 man H0120 shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
024:018 And he that killeth H5221 (8688) a beast H5315 H0929 shall make it good H7999 (8762); beast H5315 for beast H5315.
024:019 And if a man H0376 cause H5414 (8799) a blemish H3971 in his neighbour H5997; as he hath done H6213 (8804), so shall it be done H6213 (8735) to him;
024:020 Breach H7667 for breach H7667, eye H5869 for eye H5869, tooth H8127 for tooth H8127: as he hath caused H5414 (8799) a blemish H3971 in a man H0120, so shall it be done H5414 (8735) to him [again].
024:021 And he that killeth H5221 (8688) a beast H0929, he shall restore H7999 (8762) it: and he that killeth H5221 (8688) a man H0120, he shall be put to death H4191 (8714).
024:022 Ye shall have one H0259 manner of law H4941, as well for the stranger H1616, as for one of your own country H0249: for I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
024:023 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they should bring forth H3318 (8686) him that had cursed H7043 (8764) out H2351 of the camp H4264, and stone H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068. And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8804) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
025:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 in mount H2022 Sinai H5514, saying H0559 (8800),
025:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 which I give H5414 (8802) you, then shall the land H0776 keep H7673 (8804) a sabbath H7676 unto the LORD H3068.
025:003 Six H8337 years H8141 thou shalt sow H2232 (8799) thy field H7704, and six H8337 years H8141 thou shalt prune H2168 (8799) thy vineyard H3754, and gather H0622 (8804) in the fruit H8393 thereof;
025:004 But in the seventh H7637 year H8141 shall be a sabbath H7676 of rest H7677 unto the land H0776, a sabbath H7676 for the LORD H3068: thou shalt neither sow H2232 (8799) thy field H7704, nor prune H2168 (8799) thy vineyard H3754.
025:005 That which groweth of its own accord H5599 of thy harvest H7105 thou shalt not reap H7114 (8799), neither gather H1219 (8799) the grapes H6025 of thy vine undressed H5139: [for] it is a year H8141 of rest H7677 unto the land H0776.
025:006 And the sabbath H7676 of the land H0776 shall be meat H0402 for you; for thee, and for thy servant H5650, and for thy maid H0519, and for thy hired servant H7916, and for thy stranger H8453 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) with thee,
025:007 And for thy cattle H0929, and for the beast H2416 that [are] in thy land H0776, shall all the increase H8393 thereof be meat H0398 (8800).
025:008 And thou shalt number H5608 (8804) seven H7651 sabbaths H7676 of years H8141 unto thee, seven H7651 times H6471 seven H7651 years H8141; and the space H3117 of the seven H7651 sabbaths H7676 of years H8141 shall be unto thee forty H0705 and nine H8672 years H8141.
025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet H7782 of the jubile H8643 to sound H5674 (8689) on the tenth H6218 [day] of the seventh H7637 month H2320, in the day H3117 of atonement H3725 shall ye make the trumpet H7782 sound H5674 (8686) throughout all your land H0776.
025:010 And ye shall hallow H6942 (8765) the fiftieth H2572 H8141 year H8141, and proclaim H7121 (8804) liberty H1865 throughout [all] the land H0776 unto all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof: it shall be a jubile H3104 unto you; and ye shall return H7725 (8804) every man H0376 unto his possession H0272, and ye shall return H7725 (8799) every man H0376 unto his family H4940.
025:011 A jubile H3104 shall that fiftieth H2572 H8141 year H8141 be unto you: ye shall not sow H2232 (8799), neither reap H7114 (8799) that which groweth H5599 of itself in it, nor gather H1219 (8799) [the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed H5139.
025:012 For it [is] the jubile H3104; it shall be holy H6944 unto you: ye shall eat H0398 (8799) the increase H8393 thereof out of the field H7704.
025:013 In the year H8141 of this jubile H3104 ye shall return H7725 (8799) every man H0376 unto his possession H0272.
025:014 And if thou sell H4376 (8799) ought H4465 unto thy neighbour H5997, or buyest H7069 (8800) [ought] of thy neighbour’s H5997 hand H3027, ye shall not oppress H3238 (8686) one H0376 another H0251:
025:015 According to the number H4557 of years H8141 after H0310 the jubile H3104 thou shalt buy H7069 (8799) of thy neighbour H5997, [and] according unto the number H4557 of years H8141 of the fruits H8393 he shall sell H4376 (8799) unto thee:
025:016 According H6310 to the multitude H7230 of years H8141 thou shalt increase H7235 (8686) the price H4736 thereof, and according H6310 to the fewness H4591 (8800) of years H8141 thou shalt diminish H4591 (8686) the price H4736 of it: for [according] to the number H4557 [of the years] of the fruits H8393 doth he sell H4376 (8802) unto thee.
025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress H3238 (8686) one H0376 another H5997; but thou shalt fear H3372 (8804) thy God H0430: for I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
025:018 Wherefore ye shall do H6213 (8804) my statutes H2708, and keep H8104 (8799) my judgments H4941, and do H6213 (8804) them; and ye shall dwell H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 in safety H0983.
025:019 And the land H0776 shall yield H5414 (8804) her fruit H6529, and ye shall eat H0398 (8804) your fill H7648, and dwell H3427 (8804) therein in safety H0983.
025:020 And if ye shall say H0559 (8799), What shall we eat H0398 (8799) the seventh H7637 year H8141? behold, we shall not sow H2232 (8799), nor gather H0622 (8799) in our increase H8393:
025:021 Then I will command H6680 (8765) my blessing H1293 upon you in the sixth H8345 year H8141, and it shall bring forth H6213 (8804) fruit H8393 for three H7969 years H8141.
025:022 And ye shall sow H2232 (8804) the eighth H8066 year H8141, and eat H0398 (8804) [yet] of old H3465 fruit H8393 until the ninth H8671 year H8141; until her fruits H8393 come in H0935 (8800) ye shall eat H0398 (8799) [of] the old H3465 [store].
025:023 The land H0776 shall not be sold H4376 (8735) for ever H6783: for the land H0776 [is] mine; for ye [are] strangers H1616 and sojourners H8453 with me.
025:024 And in all the land H0776 of your possession H0272 ye shall grant H5414 (8799) a redemption H1353 for the land H0776.
025:025 If thy brother H0251 be waxen poor H4134 (8799), and hath sold H4376 (8804) away [some] of his possession H0272, and if any of his kin H7138 come H0935 (8804) to redeem H1350 (8802) it, then shall he redeem H1350 (8804) that which his brother H0251 sold H4465.
025:026 And if the man H0376 have none to redeem H1350 (8802) it, and himself H3027 be able H1767 H5381 (8689) to redeem H4672 (8804) H1353 it;
025:027 Then let him count H2803 (8765) the years H8141 of the sale H4465 thereof, and restore H7725 (8689) the overplus H5736 (8802) unto the man H0376 to whom he sold H4376 (8804) it; that he may return H7725 (8804) unto his possession H0272.
025:028 But if he H3027 be not able H1767 to restore H4672 (8804) H7725 (8687) [it] to him, then that which is sold H4465 shall remain in the hand H3027 of him that hath bought H7069 (8802) it until the year H8141 of jubile H3104: and in the jubile H3104 it shall go out H3318 (8804), and he shall return H7725 (8804) unto his possession H0272.
025:029 And if a man H0376 sell H4376 (8799) a dwelling H4186 house H1004 in a walled H2346 city H5892, then he may redeem H1353 it within a whole H8552 (8800) year H8141 after it is sold H4465; [within] a full year H3117 may he redeem H1353 it.
025:030 And if it be not redeemed H1350 (8735) within the space H4390 (8800) of a full H8549 year H8141, then the house H1004 that [is] in the walled H2346 city H5892 shall be established H6965 (8804) for ever H6783 to him that bought H7069 (8802) it throughout his generations H1755: it shall not go out H3318 (8799) in the jubile H3104.
025:031 But the houses H1004 of the villages H2691 which have no wall H2346 round about H5439 them shall be counted H2803 (8735) as the fields H7704 of the country H0776: they may be redeemed H1353, and they shall go out H3318 (8799) in the jubile H3104.
025:032 Notwithstanding the cities H5892 of the Levites H3881, [and] the houses H1004 of the cities H5892 of their possession H0272, may the Levites H3881 redeem H1353 at any time H5769.
025:033 And if a man purchase H1350 (8799) of the Levites H3881, then the house H1004 that was sold H4465, and the city H5892 of his possession H0272, shall go out H3318 (8804) in [the year of] jubile H3104: for the houses H1004 of the cities H5892 of the Levites H3881 [are] their possession H0272 among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
025:034 But the field H7704 of the suburbs H4054 of their cities H5892 may not be sold H4376 (8735); for it [is] their perpetual H5769 possession H0272.
025:035 And if thy brother H0251 be waxen poor H4134 (8799), and fallen in decay H4131 (8804) with thee H3027; then thou shalt relieve H2388 (8689) him: [yea, though he be] a stranger H1616, or a sojourner H8453; that he may live H2416 with thee.
025:036 Take H3947 (8799) thou no usury H5392 of him, or increase H8636: but fear H3372 (8804) thy God H0430; that thy brother H0251 may live H2416 with thee.
025:037 Thou shalt not give H5414 (8799) him thy money H3701 upon usury H5392, nor lend H5414 (8799) him thy victuals H0400 for increase H4768.
025:038 I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which brought you forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, to give H5414 (8800) you the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, [and] to be your God H0430.
025:039 And if thy brother H0251 [that dwelleth] by thee be waxen poor H4134 (8799), and be sold H4376 (8738) unto thee; thou shalt not compel H5647 (8799) him to serve H5656 as a bondservant H5650:
025:040 [But] as an hired servant H7916, [and] as a sojourner H8453, he shall be with thee, [and] shall serve H5647 (8799) thee unto the year H8141 of jubile H3104:
025:041 And [then] shall he depart H3318 (8804) from thee, [both] he and his children H1121 with him, and shall return H7725 (8804) unto his own family H4940, and unto the possession H0272 of his fathers H0001 shall he return H7725 (8799).
025:042 For they [are] my servants H5650, which I brought forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: they shall not be sold H4376 (8735) as H4466 bondmen H5650.
025:043 Thou shalt not rule H7287 (8799) over him with rigour H6531; but shalt fear H3372 (8804) thy God H0430.
025:044 Both thy bondmen H5650, and thy bondmaids H0519, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen H1471 that are round about H5439 you; of them shall ye buy H7069 (8799) bondmen H5650 and bondmaids H0519.
025:045 Moreover of the children H1121 of the strangers H8453 that do sojourn H1481 (8802) among you, of them shall ye buy H7069 (8799), and of their families H4940 that [are] with you, which they begat H3205 (8689) in your land H0776: and they shall be your possession H0272.
025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance H5157 (8694) for your children H1121 after H0310 you, to inherit H3423 (8800) [them for] a possession H0272; they shall be your bondmen H5647 (8799) for ever H5769: but over your brethren H0251 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, ye shall not rule H7287 (8799) one H0376 over another H0251 with rigour H6531.
025:047 And if a sojourner H1616 or stranger H8453 wax rich H5381 (8686) by thee H3027, and thy brother H0251 [that dwelleth] by him wax poor H4134 (8802), and sell H4376 (8738) himself unto the stranger H1616 [or] sojourner H8453 by thee, or to the stock H6133 of the stranger’s H1616 family H4940:
025:048 After H0310 that he is sold H4376 (8738) he may be redeemed again H1353; one H0259 of his brethren H0251 may redeem H1350 (8799) him:
025:049 Either his uncle H1730, or his uncle’s H1730 son H1121, may redeem H1350 (8799) him, or [any] that is nigh H7607 of kin H1320 unto him of his family H4940 may redeem H1350 (8799) him; or if he be able H5381 (8689), he may redeem H1350 (8738) himself H3027.
025:050 And he shall reckon H2803 (8765) with him that bought H7069 (8802) him from the year H8141 that he was sold H4376 (8736) to him unto the year H8141 of jubile H3104: and the price H3701 of his sale H4465 shall be according unto the number H4557 of years H8141, according to the time H3117 of an hired servant H7916 shall it be with him.
025:051 If [there be] yet many H7227 years H8141 [behind], according H6310 unto them he shall give again H7725 (8686) the price of his redemption H1353 out of the money H3701 that he was bought H4736 for.
025:052 And if there remain H7604 (8738) but few H4592 years H8141 unto the year H8141 of jubile H3104, then he shall count H2803 (8765) with him, [and] according H6310 unto his years H8141 shall he give him again H7725 (8686) the price of his redemption H1353.
025:053 [And] as a yearly H8141 H8141 hired servant H7916 shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule H7287 (8799) with rigour H6531 over him in thy sight H5869.
025:054 And if he be not redeemed H1350 (8735) in these [years], then he shall go out H3318 (8804) in the year H8141 of jubile H3104, [both] he, and his children H1121 with him.
025:055 For unto me the children H1121 of Israel H3478 [are] servants H5650; they [are] my servants H5650 whom I brought forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
026:001 ¶ Ye shall make H6213 (8799) you no idols H0457 nor graven image H6459, neither rear you up H6965 (8686) a standing image H4676, neither shall ye set up H5414 (8799) [any] image H4906 of stone H0068 in your land H0776, to bow down H7812 (8692) unto it: for I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
026:002 Ye shall keep H8104 (8799) my sabbaths H7676, and reverence H3372 (8799) my sanctuary H4720: I [am] the LORD H3068.
026:003 If ye walk H3212 (8799) in my statutes H2708, and keep H8104 (8799) my commandments H4687, and do H6213 (8804) them;
026:004 Then I will give H5414 (8804) you rain H1653 in due season H6256, and the land H0776 shall yield H5414 (8804) her increase H2981, and the trees H6086 of the field H7704 shall yield H5414 (8799) their fruit H6529.
026:005 And your threshing H1786 shall reach H5381 (8689) unto the vintage H1210, and the vintage H1210 shall reach H5381 (8686) unto the sowing time H2233: and ye shall eat H0398 (8804) your bread H3899 to the full H7648, and dwell H3427 (8804) in your land H0776 safely H0983.
026:006 And I will give H5414 (8804) peace H7965 in the land H0776, and ye shall lie down H7901 (8804), and none shall make [you] afraid H2729 (8688): and I will rid H7673 (8689) evil H7451 beasts H2416 out of the land H0776, neither shall the sword H2719 go H5674 (8799) through your land H0776.
026:007 And ye shall chase H7291 (8804) your enemies H0341 (8802), and they shall fall H5307 (8804) before H6440 you by the sword H2719.
026:008 And five H2568 of you shall chase H7291 (8804) an hundred H3967, and an hundred H3967 of you shall put ten thousand H7233 to flight H7291 (8799): and your enemies H0341 (8802) shall fall H5307 (8804) before H6440 you by the sword H2719.
026:009 For I will have respect H6437 (8804) unto you, and make you fruitful H6509 (8689), and multiply H7235 (8689) you, and establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285 with you.
026:010 And ye shall eat H0398 (8804) old store H3462 (8737), and bring forth H3318 (8686) the old H3465 because H6440 of the new H2319.
026:011 And I will set H5414 (8804) my tabernacle H4908 among H8432 you: and my soul H5315 shall not abhor H1602 (8799) you.
026:012 And I will walk H1980 (8694) among H8432 you, and will be H1961 (8799) your God H0430, and ye shall be H1961 (8799) my people H5971.
026:013 I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which brought you forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, that ye should not be their bondmen H5650; and I have broken H7665 (8799) the bands H4133 of your yoke H5923, and made you go H3212 (8686) upright H6968.
026:014 But if ye will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto me, and will not do H6213 (8799) all these commandments H4687;
026:015 And if ye shall despise H3988 (8799) my statutes H2708, or if your soul H5315 abhor H1602 (8799) my judgments H4941, so that ye will not do H6213 (8800) all my commandments H4687, [but] that ye break H6565 (8687) my covenant H1285:
026:016 I also will do H6213 (8799) this unto you; I will even appoint H6485 (8689) over you terror H0928, consumption H7829, and the burning ague H6920, that shall consume H3615 (8764) the eyes H5869, and cause sorrow H1727 (8688) of heart H5315: and ye shall sow H2232 (8804) your seed H2233 in vain H7385, for your enemies H0341 (8802) shall eat H0398 (8804) it.
026:017 And I will set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 against you, and ye shall be slain H5062 (8738) before H6440 your enemies H0341 (8802): they that hate H8130 (8802) you shall reign H7287 (8804) over you; and ye shall flee H5127 (8804) when none pursueth H7291 (8802) you.
026:018 And if ye will not yet H5704 for all this hearken H8085 (8799) unto me, then I will punish H3256 (8763) you seven times H7651 more H3254 (8804) for your sins H2403.
026:019 And I will break H7665 (8804) the pride H1347 of your power H5797; and I will make H5414 (8804) your heaven H8064 as iron H1270, and your earth H0776 as brass H5154:
026:020 And your strength H3581 shall be spent H8552 (8804) in vain H7385: for your land H0776 shall not yield H5414 (8799) her increase H2981, neither shall the trees H6086 of the land H0776 yield H5414 (8799) their fruits H6529.
026:021 And if ye walk H3212 (8799) contrary H7147 unto me, and will H0014 (8799) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto me; I will bring H3254 seven times H7651 more H3254 (8804) plagues H4347 upon you according to your sins H2403.
026:022 I will also send H7971 (8689) wild H7704 beasts H2416 among you, which shall rob you of your children H7921 (8765), and destroy H3772 (8689) your cattle H0929, and make you few in number H4591 (8689); and your [high] ways H1870 shall be desolate H8074 (8738).
026:023 And if ye will not be reformed H3256 (8735) by me by these things, but will walk H1980 (8804) contrary H7147 unto me;
026:024 Then will I also walk H1980 (8804) contrary H7147 unto you, and will punish H5221 (8689) you yet H1571 seven times H7651 for your sins H2403.
026:025 And I will bring H0935 (8689) a sword H2719 upon you, that shall avenge H5358 (8802) the quarrel H5359 of [my] covenant H1285: and when ye are gathered together H0622 (8738) within H0413 your cities H5892, I will send H7971 (8765) the pestilence H1698 among H8432 you; and ye shall be delivered H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the enemy H0341 (8802).
026:026 [And] when I have broken H7665 (8800) the staff H4294 of your bread H3899, ten H6235 women H0802 shall bake H0644 (8804) your bread H3899 in one H0259 oven H8574, and they shall deliver H7725 [you] your bread H3899 again H7725 (8689) by weight H4948: and ye shall eat H0398 (8804), and not be satisfied H7646 (8799).
026:027 And if ye will not for all this H2063 hearken H8085 (8799) unto me, but walk H1980 (8804) contrary H7147 unto me;
026:028 Then I will walk H1980 (8804) contrary H7147 unto you also in fury H2534; and I, even H0637 I, will chastise H3256 (8765) you seven times H7651 for your sins H2403.
026:029 And ye shall eat H0398 (8804) the flesh H1320 of your sons H1121, and the flesh H1320 of your daughters H1323 shall ye eat H0398 (8799).
026:030 And I will destroy H8045 (8689) your high places H1116, and cut down H3772 (8689) your images H2553, and cast H5414 (8804) your carcases H6297 upon the carcases H6297 of your idols H1544, and my soul H5315 shall abhor H1602 (8804) you.
026:031 And I will make H5414 (8804) your cities H5892 waste H2723, and bring H8074 your sanctuaries H4720 unto desolation H8074 (8689), and I will not smell H7306 (8686) the savour H7381 of your sweet odours H5207.
026:032 And I will bring H8074 the land H0776 into desolation H8074 (8689): and your enemies H0341 (8802) which dwell H3427 (8802) therein shall be astonished H8074 (8804) at it.
026:033 And I will scatter H2219 (8762) you among the heathen H1471, and will draw out H7324 (8689) a sword H2719 after H0310 you: and your land H0776 shall be desolate H8077, and your cities H5892 waste H2723.
026:034 Then shall the land H0776 enjoy H7521 (8799) her sabbaths H7676, as long H3117 as it lieth desolate H8074 (8715), and ye [be] in your enemies H0341 (8802) ’ land H0776; [even] then shall the land H0776 rest H7673 (8799), and enjoy H7521 (8689) her sabbaths H7676.
026:035 As long as H3117 it lieth desolate H8074 (8715) it shall rest H7673 (8799); because it did not rest H7673 (8804) in your sabbaths H7676, when ye dwelt H3427 (8800) upon it.
026:036 And upon them that are left H7604 (8737) [alive] of you I will send H0935 (8689) a faintness H4816 into their hearts H3824 in the lands H0776 of their enemies H0341 (8802); and the sound H6963 of a shaken H5086 (8737) leaf H5929 shall chase H7291 (8804) them; and they shall flee H5127 (8804), as fleeing H4499 from a sword H2719; and they shall fall H5307 (8804) when none pursueth H7291 (8802).
026:037 And they shall fall H3782 (8804) one H0376 upon another H0251, as it were before H6440 a sword H2719, when none pursueth H7291 (8802): and ye shall have no power to stand H8617 before H6440 your enemies H0341 (8802).
026:038 And ye shall perish H0006 (8804) among the heathen H1471, and the land H0776 of your enemies H0341 (8802) shall eat you up H0398 (8804).
026:039 And they that are left H7604 (8737) of you shall pine away H4743 (8735) in their iniquity H5771 in your enemies H0341 (8802) ’ lands H0776; and also in the iniquities H5771 of their fathers H0001 shall they pine away H4743 (8735) with them.
026:040 If they shall confess H3034 (8694) their iniquity H5771, and the iniquity H5771 of their fathers H0001, with their trespass H4604 which they trespassed H4603 (8804) against me, and that also they have walked H1980 (8804) contrary H7147 unto me;
026:041 And [that] I also have walked H3212 (8799) contrary H7147 unto them, and have brought H0935 (8689) them into the land H0776 of their enemies H0341 (8802); if then H0176 their uncircumcised H6189 hearts H3824 be humbled H3665 (8735), and they then accept H7521 (8799) of the punishment of their iniquity H5771:
026:042 Then will I remember H2142 (8804) my covenant H1285 with Jacob H3290, and also my covenant H1285 with Isaac H3327, and also my covenant H1285 with Abraham H0085 will I remember H2142 (8799); and I will remember H2142 (8799) the land H0776.
026:043 The land H0776 also shall be left H5800 (8735) of them, and shall enjoy H7521 (8799) her sabbaths H7676, while she lieth desolate H8074 (8715) without them: and they shall accept H7521 (8799) of the punishment of their iniquity H5771: because H3282, even because H3282 they despised H3988 (8804) my judgments H4941, and because their soul H5315 abhorred H1602 (8804) my statutes H2708.
026:044 And yet H0637 for all that H2063, when they be H1571 in the land H0776 of their enemies H0341 (8802), I will not cast them away H3988 (8804), neither will I abhor H1602 (8804) them, to destroy them utterly H3615 (8763), and to break H6565 (8687) my covenant H1285 with them: for I [am] the LORD H3068 their God H0430.
026:045 But I will for their sakes remember H2142 (8804) the covenant H1285 of their ancestors H7223, whom I brought forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 in the sight H5869 of the heathen H1471, that I might be their God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068.
026:046 These [are] the statutes H2706 and judgments H4941 and laws H8451, which the LORD H3068 made H5414 (8804) between him and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in mount H2022 Sinai H5514 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
027:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
027:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When a man H0376 shall make a singular H6381 (8686) vow H5088, the persons H5315 [shall be] for the LORD H3068 by thy estimation H6187.
027:003 And thy estimation H6187 shall be of the male H2145 from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 even unto sixty H8346 years H8141 old H1121, even thy estimation H6187 shall be fifty H2572 shekels H8255 of silver H3701, after the shekel H8255 of the sanctuary H6944.
027:004 And if it [be] a female H5347, then thy estimation H6187 shall be thirty H7970 shekels H8255.
027:005 And if [it be] from five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 even unto twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121, then thy estimation H6187 shall be of the male H2145 twenty H6242 shekels H8255, and for the female H5347 ten H6235 shekels H8255.
027:006 And if [it be] from a month H2320 old H1121 even unto five H2568 years H8141 old H1121, then thy estimation H6187 shall be of the male H2145 five H2568 shekels H8255 of silver H3701, and for the female H5347 thy estimation H6187 [shall be] three H7969 shekels H8255 of silver H3701.
027:007 And if [it be] from sixty H8346 years H8141 old H1121 and above H4605; if [it be] a male H2145, then thy estimation H6187 shall be fifteen H2568 H6240 shekels H8255, and for the female H5347 ten H6235 shekels H8255.
027:008 But if he be poorer H4134 (8802) than thy estimation H6187, then he shall present H5975 (8689) himself before H6440 the priest H3548, and the priest H3548 shall value H6186 (8689) him; according to H6310 his ability H3027 H5381 (8686) that vowed H5087 (8802) shall the priest H3548 value H6186 (8686) him.
027:009 And if [it be] a beast H0929, whereof men bring H7126 (8686) an offering H7133 unto the LORD H3068, all that [any man] giveth H5414 (8799) of such unto the LORD H3068 shall be holy H6944.
027:010 He shall not alter H2498 (8686) it, nor change H4171 (8686) it, a good H2896 for a bad H7451, or a bad H7451 for a good H2896: and if he shall at all H4171 (8687) change H4171 (8686) beast H0929 for beast H0929, then it and the exchange H8545 thereof shall be holy H6944.
027:011 And if [it be] any unclean H2931 beast H0929, of which they do not offer H7126 (8686) a sacrifice H7133 unto the LORD H3068, then he shall present H5975 (8689) the beast H0929 before H6440 the priest H3548:
027:012 And the priest H3548 shall value H6186 (8689) it, whether H0996 it be good H2896 or H0996 bad H7451: as thou valuest H6187 it, [who art] the priest H3548, so shall it be.
027:013 But if he will at all H1350 (8800) redeem H1350 (8799) it, then he shall add H3254 (8804) a fifth H2549 [part] thereof unto thy estimation H6187.
027:014 And when a man H0376 shall sanctify H6942 (8686) his house H1004 [to be] holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068, then the priest H3548 shall estimate H6186 (8689) it, whether it be good H2896 or bad H7451: as the priest H3548 shall estimate H6186 (8686) it, so shall it stand H6965 (8799).
027:015 And if he that sanctified H6942 (8688) it will redeem H1350 (8799) his house H1004, then he shall add H3254 (8804) the fifth H2549 [part] of the money H3701 of thy estimation H6187 unto it, and it shall be his.
027:016 And if a man H0376 shall sanctify H6942 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 [some part] of a field H7704 of his possession H0272, then thy estimation H6187 shall be according H6310 to the seed H2233 thereof: an homer H2563 of barley H8184 seed H2233 [shall be valued] at fifty H2572 shekels H8255 of silver H3701.
027:017 If he sanctify H6942 (8686) his field H7704 from the year H8141 of jubile H3104, according to thy estimation H6187 it shall stand H6965 (8799).
027:018 But if he sanctify H6942 (8686) his field H7704 after H0310 the jubile H3104, then the priest H3548 shall reckon H2803 (8765) unto him the money H3701 according to H6310 the years H8141 that remain H3498 (8737), even unto the year H8141 of the jubile H3104, and it shall be abated H1639 (8738) from thy estimation H6187.
027:019 And if he that sanctified H6942 (8688) the field H7704 will in any wise H1350 (8800) redeem H1350 (8799) it, then he shall add H3254 (8804) the fifth H2549 [part] of the money H3701 of thy estimation H6187 unto it, and it shall be assured H6965 (8804) to him.
027:020 And if he will not redeem H1350 (8799) the field H7704, or if he have sold H4376 (8804) the field H7704 to another H0312 man H0376, it shall not be redeemed H1350 (8735) any more.
027:021 But the field H7704, when it goeth out H3318 (8800) in the jubile H3104, shall be holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068, as a field H7704 devoted H2764; the possession H0272 thereof shall be the priest’s H3548.
027:022 And if [a man] sanctify H6942 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 a field H7704 which he hath bought H4736, which [is] not of the fields H7704 of his possession H0272;
027:023 Then the priest H3548 shall reckon H2803 (8765) unto him the worth H4373 of thy estimation H6187, [even] unto the year H8141 of the jubile H3104: and he shall give H5414 (8804) thine estimation H6187 in that day H3117, [as] a holy thing H6944 unto the LORD H3068.
027:024 In the year H8141 of the jubile H3104 the field H7704 shall return H7725 (8799) unto him of whom it was bought H7069 (8804), [even] to him to whom the possession H0272 of the land H0776 [did belong].
027:025 And all thy estimations H6187 shall be according to the shekel H8255 of the sanctuary H6944: twenty H6242 gerahs H1626 shall be the shekel H8255.
027:026 Only the firstling H1060 of the beasts H0929, which should be the LORD’S H3068 firstling H1069 (8792), no man H0376 shall sanctify H6942 (8686) it; whether [it be] ox H7794, or sheep H7716: it [is] the LORD’S H3068.
027:027 And if [it be] of an unclean H2931 beast H0929, then he shall redeem H6299 (8804) [it] according to thine estimation H6187, and shall add H3254 (8804) a fifth H2549 [part] of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed H1350 (8735), then it shall be sold H4376 (8738) according to thy estimation H6187.
027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing H2764, that a man H0376 shall devote H2763 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 of all that he hath, [both] of man H0120 and beast H0929, and of the field H7704 of his possession H0272, shall be sold H4376 (8735) or redeemed H1350 (8735): every devoted thing H2764 [is] most H6944 holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068.
027:029 None devoted H2764, which shall be H3808 devoted H2763 (8714) of men H0120, shall be redeemed H6299 (8735); [but] shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
027:030 And all the tithe H4643 of the land H0776, [whether] of the seed H2233 of the land H0776, [or] of the fruit H6529 of the tree H6086, [is] the LORD’S H3068: [it is] holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068.
027:031 And if a man H0376 will at all H1350 (8800) redeem H1350 (8799) [ought] of his tithes H4643, he shall add H3254 (8686) thereto the fifth H2549 [part] thereof.
027:032 And concerning the tithe H4643 of the herd H1241, or of the flock H6629, [even] of whatsoever passeth H5674 (8799) under the rod H7626, the tenth H6224 shall be holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068.
027:033 He shall not search H1239 (8762) whether it be good H2896 or bad H7451, neither shall he change H4171 (8686) it: and if he change H4171 (8686) it at all H4171 (8687), then both it and the change H8545 thereof shall be holy H6944; it shall not be redeemed H1350 (8735).
027:034 These [are] the commandments H4687, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in mount H2022 Sinai H5514.
