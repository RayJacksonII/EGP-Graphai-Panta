001:001 ¶ The Revelation G0602 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, which G3739 God G2316 gave G1325 (AorActInd) unto him G0846, to shew G1166 (AorActInf) unto his G0846 servants G1401 things which G3739 must G1163 (PresInd) shortly G1722 G5034 come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf); and G2532 he sent G0649 (AorActPtc) and signified G4591 (AorActInd) [it] by G1223 his G0846 angel G0032 unto his G0846 servant G1401 John G2491:
001:002 Who G3739 bare record G3140 (AorActInd) of the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 of the testimony G3141 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, and G5037 of all things G3745 that he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd).
001:003 Blessed G3107 [is] he that readeth G0314 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they that hear G0191 (PresActPtc) the words G3056 of this prophecy G4394, and G2532 keep G5083 (PresActPtc) those things which are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) therein G1722 G0846: for G1063 the time G2540 [is] at hand G1451.
001:004 John G2491 to the seven G2033 churches G1577 which G3588 are in G1722 Asia G0773: Grace G5485 [be] unto you G5213, and G2532 peace G1515, from G0575 him which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) G3801, and G2532 which G3588 was G2258 (ImpfInd) G3801, and G2532 which G3588 is to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G3801; and G2532 from G0575 the seven G2033 Spirits G4151 which G3739 are G2076 (PresInd) before G1799 his G0846 throne G2362;
001:005 And G2532 from G0575 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, [who is] the faithful G4103 witness G3144, [and] the first begotten G4416 of G1537 the dead G3498, and G2532 the prince G0758 of the kings G0935 of the earth G1093. Unto him that loved G0025 (AorActPtc) us G2248, and G2532 washed G3068 (AorActPtc) us G2248 from G0575 our G2257 sins G0266 in G1722 his own G0846 blood G0129,
001:006 And G2532 hath made G4160 (AorActInd) us G2248 kings G0935 and G2532 priests G2409 unto God G2316 and G2532 his G0846 Father G3962; to him G0846 [be] glory G1391 and G2532 dominion G2904 for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165. Amen G0281.
001:007 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) with G3326 clouds G3507; and G2532 every G3956 eye G3788 shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 they [also] which G3748 pierced G1574 (AorActInd) him G0846: and G2532 all G3956 kindreds G5443 of the earth G1093 shall wail G2875 (FutMidDepInd) because G1909 of him G0846. Even so G3483, Amen G0281.
001:008 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Alpha G0001 and G2532 Omega G5598, the beginning G0746 and G2532 the ending G5056, saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962, which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) G3801, and G2532 which G3588 was G2258 (ImpfInd) G3801, and G2532 which G3588 is to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G3801, the Almighty G3841.
001:009 I G1473 John G2491, who G3588 also G2532 am your G5216 brother G0080, and G2532 companion G4791 in G1722 tribulation G2347, and G2532 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 and G2532 patience G5281 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the isle G3520 that is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Patmos G3963, for G1223 the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 for G1223 the testimony G3141 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
001:010 I was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the Spirit G4151 on G1722 the Lord’s G2960 day G2250, and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd) behind G3694 me G3450 a great G3173 voice G5456, as G5613 of a trumpet G4536,
001:011 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Alpha G0001 and G2532 Omega G5598, the first G4413 and G2532 the last G2078: and G2532, What G3739 thou seest G0991 (PresActInd), write G1125 (AorActImpr) in G1519 a book G0975, and G2532 send G3992 (AorActImpr) [it] unto the seven G2033 churches G1577 which G3588 are in G1722 Asia G0773; unto G1519 Ephesus G2181, and G2532 unto G1519 Smyrna G4667, and G2532 unto G1519 Pergamos G4010, and G2532 unto G1519 Thyatira G2363, and G2532 unto G1519 Sardis G4554, and G2532 unto G1519 Philadelphia G5359, and G2532 unto G1519 Laodicea G2993.
001:012 And G2532 I turned G1994 (AorActInd) to see G0991 (PresActInf) the voice G5456 that G3748 spake G2980 (AorActInd) with G3326 me G1700. And G2532 being turned G1994 (AorActPtc), I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) seven G2033 golden G5552 candlesticks G3087;
001:013 And G2532 in G1722 the midst G3319 of the seven G2033 candlesticks G3087 [one] like G3664 unto the Son G5207 of man G0444, clothed with a garment G1746 (PerfMidPtc) down to the foot G4158, and G2532 girt G4024 (PerfPasPtc) about G4314 the paps G3149 with a golden G5552 girdle G2223.
001:014  G1161 His G0846 head G2776 and G2532 [his] hairs G2359 [were] white G3022 like G5616 wool G2053, as white G3022 as G5613 snow G5510; and G2532 his G0846 eyes G3788 [were] as G5613 a flame G5395 of fire G4442;
001:015 And G2532 his G0846 feet G4228 like G3664 unto fine brass G5474, as G5613 if they burned G4448 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 a furnace G2575; and G2532 his G0846 voice G5456 as G5613 the sound G5456 of many G4183 waters G5204.
001:016 And G2532 he had G2192 (PresActPtc) in G1722 his G0846 right G1188 hand G5495 seven G2033 stars G0792: and G2532 out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750 went G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) a sharp G3691 twoedged G1366 sword G4501: and G2532 his G0846 countenance G3799 [was] as G5613 the sun G2246 shineth G5316 (PresActInd) in G1722 his G0846 strength G1411.
001:017 And G2532 when G3753 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, I fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) at G4314 his G0846 feet G4228 as G5613 dead G3498. And G2532 he laid G2007 (AorActInd) his G0846 right G1188 hand G5495 upon G1909 me G1691, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361; I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the first G4413 and G2532 the last G2078:
001:018  G2532 I [am] he that liveth G2198 (PresActPtc), and G2532 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) dead G3498; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I am G1510 (PresInd) alive G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 evermore G0165 G0165, Amen G0281; and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) the keys G2807 of hell G0086 and G2532 of death G2288.
001:019 Write G1125 (AorActImpr) the things which G3739 thou hast seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the things which G3739 are G1526 (PresInd), and G2532 the things which G3739 shall G3195 (PresActInd) be G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf) hereafter G3326 G5023;
001:020 The mystery G3466 of the seven G2033 stars G0792 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G1909 my G3450 right hand G1188, and G2532 the seven G2033 golden G5552 candlesticks G3087. The seven G2033 stars G0792 are G1526 (PresInd) the angels G0032 of the seven G2033 churches G1577: and G2532 the seven G2033 candlesticks G3087 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) are G1526 (PresInd) the seven G2033 churches G1577.
002:001 ¶ Unto the angel G0032 of the church G1577 of Ephesus G2179 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he that holdeth G2902 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 stars G0792 in G1722 his G0846 right hand G1188, who G3588 walketh G4043 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319 of the seven G2033 golden G5552 candlesticks G3087;
002:002 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, and G2532 thy G4675 labour G2873, and G2532 thy G4675 patience G5281, and G2532 how G3754 thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 bear G0941 (AorActInf) them which are evil G2556: and G2532 thou hast tried G3985 (AorMidInd) them which say G5335 (PresActPtc) they are G1511 (PresInf) apostles G0652, and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756, and G2532 hast found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 liars G5571:
002:003 And G2532 hast borne G0941 (AorActInd), and G2532 hast G2192 (PresActInd) patience G5281, and G2532 for G1223 my G3450 name’s sake G1223 G3686 hast laboured G2872 (PerfActInd), and G2532 hast G2577 not G3756 fainted G2577 (PerfActInd).
002:004 Nevertheless G0235 I have G2192 (PresActInd) [somewhat] against G2596 thee G4675, because G3754 thou hast left G0863 (AorActInd) thy G4675 first G4413 love G0026.
002:005 Remember G3421 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767 from whence G4159 thou art fallen G1601 (PerfActInd), and G2532 repent G3340 (AorActImpr), and G2532 do G4160 (AorActImpr) the first G4413 works G2041; or else G1490 I will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto thee G4671 quickly G5035, and G2532 will remove G2795 (FutActInd) thy G4675 candlestick G3087 out of G1537 his G0846 place G5117, except G3362 thou repent G3340 (AorActSubj).
002:006 But G0235 this G5124 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd), that G3754 thou hatest G3404 (PresActInd) the deeds G2041 of the Nicolaitans G3531, which G3739 I also G2504 hate G3404 (PresActInd).
002:007 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577; To him G0846 that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) will I give G1325 (FutActInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) of G1537 the tree G3586 of life G2222, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 the midst G3319 of the paradise G3857 of God G2316.
002:008 And G2532 unto the angel G0032 of the church G1577 in Smyrna G4668 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the first G4413 and G2532 the last G2078, which G3739 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) dead G3498, and G2532 is alive G2198 (AorActInd);
002:009 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, and G2532 tribulation G2347, and G2532 poverty G4432, (but G1161 thou art G1488 (PresInd) rich G4145 ) and G2532 [I know] the blasphemy G0988 of them which G3588 say G3004 (PresActPtc) they G1438 are G1511 (PresInf) Jews G2453, and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756, but G0235 [are] the synagogue G4864 of Satan G4567.
002:010 Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) none G3367 of those things which G3739 thou shalt G3195 (PresActInd) suffer G3958 (PresActInf): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the devil G1228 shall G3195 (PresActInd) cast G0906 (Aor2ActInf) [some] of G1537 you G5216 into G1519 prison G5438, that G2443 ye may be tried G3985 (AorPasSubj); and G2532 ye shall have G2192 (FutActInd) tribulation G2347 ten G1176 days G2250: be thou G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) faithful G4103 unto G0891 death G2288, and G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) thee G4671 a crown G4735 of life G2222.
002:011 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577; He that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) shall G0091 not G3364 be hurt G0091 (AorPasSubj) of G1537 the second G1208 death G2288.
002:012 And G2532 to the angel G0032 of the church G1577 in G1722 Pergamos G4010 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he which hath G2192 (PresActPtc) the sharp G3691 sword G4501 with two edges G1366;
002:013 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, and G2532 where G4226 thou dwellest G2730 (PresActInd), [even] where G3699 Satan’s G4567 seat G2362 [is]: and G2532 thou holdest fast G2902 (PresActInd) my G3450 name G3686, and G2532 hast G0720 not G3756 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) my G3450 faith G4102, even G2532 in G1722 those days G2250 wherein G1722 G3739 Antipas G0493 [was] my G3450 faithful G4103 martyr G3144, who G3739 was slain G0615 (AorPasInd) among G3844 you G5213, where G3699 Satan G4567 dwelleth G2730 (PresActInd).
002:014 But G0235 I have G2192 (PresActInd) a few things G3641 against G2596 thee G4675, because G3754 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) there G1563 them that hold G2902 (PresActPtc) the doctrine G1322 of Balaam G0903, who G3739 taught G1722 G1321 (ImpfActInd) Balac G0904 to cast G0906 (Aor2ActInf) a stumblingblock G4625 before G1799 the children G5207 of Israel G2474, to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) things sacrificed unto idols G1494, and G2532 to commit fornication G4203 (AorActInf).
002:015 So G3779 hast G2192 (PresActInd) thou G4771 also G2532 them that hold G2902 (PresActPtc) the doctrine G1322 of the Nicolaitans G3531, which thing G3739 I hate G3404 (PresActInd).
002:016 Repent G3340 (AorActImpr); or else G1490 I will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto thee G4671 quickly G5035, and G2532 will fight G4170 (FutActInd) against G3326 them G0846 with G1722 the sword G4501 of my G3450 mouth G4750.
002:017 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577; To him G0846 that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) will I give G1325 (FutActInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) of G0575 the hidden G2928 (PerfPasPtc) manna G3131, and G2532 will give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846 a white G3022 stone G5586, and G2532 in G1909 the stone G5586 a new G2537 name G3686 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), which G3739 no man G3762 knoweth G1097 (Aor2ActInd) saving G1508 he that receiveth G2983 (PresActPtc) [it].
002:018 And G2532 unto the angel G0032 of the church G1577 in G1722 Thyatira G2363 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, who G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) his G0846 eyes G3788 like G5613 unto a flame G5395 of fire G4442, and G2532 his G0846 feet G4228 [are] like G3664 fine brass G5474;
002:019 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, and G2532 charity G0026, and G2532 service G1248, and G2532 faith G4102, and G2532 thy G4675 patience G5281, and G2532 thy G4675 works G2041; and G2532 the last G2078 [to be] more than G4119 the first G4413.
002:020 Notwithstanding G0235 I have G2192 (PresActInd) a few things G3641 against G2596 thee G4675, because G3754 thou sufferest G1439 (PresActInd) that woman G1135 Jezebel G2403, which G3588 calleth G3004 (PresActPtc) herself G1438 a prophetess G4398, to teach G1321 (PresActInf) and G2532 to seduce G4105 (PresPasInf) my G1699 servants G1401 to commit fornication G4203 (AorActInf), and G2532 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) things sacrificed unto idols G1494.
002:021 And G2532 I gave G1325 (AorActInd) her G0846 space G5550 to G2443 repent G3340 (AorActSubj) of G1537 her G0846 fornication G4202; and G2532 she repented G3340 (AorActInd) not G3756.
002:022 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 will cast G0906 (PresActInd) her G0846 into G1519 a bed G2825, and G2532 them that commit adultery G3431 (PresActPtc) with G3326 her G0846 into G1519 great G3173 tribulation G2347, except G3362 they repent G3340 (AorActSubj) of G1537 their G0846 deeds G2041.
002:023 And G2532 I will kill G0615 (FutActInd) her G0846 children G5043 with G1722 death G2288; and G2532 all G3956 the churches G1577 shall know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) he which G3588 searcheth G2045 (PresActPtc) the reins G3510 and G2532 hearts G2588: and G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) unto every one G1538 of you G5213 according to G2596 your G5216 works G2041.
002:024 But G1161 unto you G5213 I say G3004 (PresActInd), and G2532 unto the rest G3062 in G1722 Thyatira G2363, as many as G3745 have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 this G5026 doctrine G1322, and G2532 which G3748 have G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) the depths G0899 of Satan G4567, as G5613 they speak G3004 (PresActInd); I will put G0906 (FutActInd) upon G1909 you G5209 none G3756 other G0243 burden G0922.
002:025 But G4133 that which G3739 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) [already] hold fast G2902 (AorActImpr) till G0891 G3739 I come G0302 G2240 (AorActSubj).
002:026 And G2532 he that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc), and G2532 keepeth G5083 (PresActPtc) my G3450 works G2041 unto G0891 the end G5056, to him G0846 will I give G1325 (FutActInd) power G1849 over G1909 the nations G1484:
002:027 And G2532 he shall rule G4165 (FutActInd) them G0846 with G1722 a rod G4464 of iron G4603; as G5613 the vessels G4632 of a potter G2764 shall they be broken to shivers G4937 (PresPasInd): even G2504 as G5613 I G2504 received G2983 (PerfActInd) of G3844 my G3450 Father G3962.
002:028 And G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846 the morning G4407 star G0792.
002:029 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577.
003:001 ¶ And G2532 unto the angel G0032 of the church G1577 in G1722 Sardis G4554 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 Spirits G4151 of God G2316, and G2532 the seven G2033 stars G0792; I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, that G3754 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) a name G3686 that G3754 thou livest G2198 (PresActInd), and G2532 art G1488 (PresInd) dead G3498.
003:002 Be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) watchful G1127 (PresActPtc), and G2532 strengthen G4741 (AorActImpr) the things which remain G3062, that G3739 are G3195 (PresActInd) ready to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf): for G1063 I have G2147 not G3756 found G2147 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041 perfect G4137 (PerfPasPtc) before G1799 God G2316.
003:003 Remember G3421 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767 how G4459 thou hast received G2983 (PerfActInd) and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd), and G2532 hold fast G5083 (PresActImpr), and G2532 repent G3340 (AorActImpr). If G3362 therefore G3767 thou shalt G1127 not G3362 watch G1127 (AorActSubj), I will come G2240 (FutActInd) on G1909 thee G4571 as G5613 a thief G2812, and G2532 thou shalt G1097 not G3364 know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) what G4169 hour G5610 I will come G2240 (FutActInd) upon G1909 thee G4571.
003:004 Thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) a few G3641 names G3686 even G2532 in G1722 Sardis G4554 which G3739 have G3435 not G3756 defiled G3435 (AorActInd) their G0846 garments G2440; and G2532 they shall walk G4043 (FutActInd) with G3326 me G1700 in G1722 white G3022: for G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) worthy G0514.
003:005 He that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc), the same G3778 shall be clothed G4016 (FutMidInd) in G1722 white G3022 raiment G2440; and G2532 I will G1813 not G3364 blot out G1813 (FutActInd) his G0846 name G3686 out of G1537 the book G0976 of life G2222, but G2532 I will confess G1843 (FutMidInd) his G0846 name G3686 before G1799 my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 before G1799 his G0846 angels G0032.
003:006 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577.
003:007 And G2532 to the angel G0032 of the church G1577 in G1722 Philadelphia G5359 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he that is holy G0040, he that is true G0228, he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) the key G2807 of David G1138, he that openeth G0455 (PresActPtc), and G2532 no man G3762 shutteth G2808 (PresActInd); and G2532 shutteth G2808 (PresActInd), and G2532 no man G3762 openeth G0455 (PresActInd);
003:008 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041: behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I have set G1325 (PerfActInd) before G1799 thee G4675 an open G0455 (PerfPasPtc) door G2374, and G2532 no man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) shut G2808 (AorActInf) it G0846: for G3754 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) a little G3398 strength G1411, and G2532 hast kept G5083 (AorActInd) my G3450 word G3056, and G2532 hast G0720 not G3756 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) my G3450 name G3686.
003:009 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I will make G1325 (PresActInd) them of G1537 the synagogue G4864 of Satan G4567, which G3588 say G3004 (PresActPtc) they G1438 are G1511 (PresInf) Jews G2453, and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756, but G0235 do lie G5574 (PresMidPasInd); behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I will make G4160 (FutActInd) them G0846 to G2443 come G2240 (AorActSubj) and G2532 worship G4352 (AorActSubj) before G1799 thy G4675 feet G4228, and G2532 to know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) that G3754 I G1473 have loved G0025 (AorActInd) thee G4571.
003:010 Because G3754 thou hast kept G5083 (AorActInd) the word G3056 of my G3450 patience G5281, I also G2504 will keep G5083 (FutActInd) thee G4571 from G1537 the hour G5610 of temptation G3986, which G3588 shall come G3195 (PresActPtc) G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) upon G1909 all G3650 the world G3625, to try G3985 (AorActInf) them that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the earth G1093.
003:011 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) quickly G5035: hold that fast G2902 (PresActImpr) which G3739 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd), that G2443 no man G3367 take G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) thy G4675 crown G4735.
003:012 Him G0846 that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) will I make G4160 (FutActInd) a pillar G4769 in G1722 the temple G3485 of my G3450 God G2316, and G2532 he shall go G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) no G3364 more G2089 out G1854: and G2532 I will write G1125 (FutActInd) upon G1909 him G0846 the name G3686 of my G3450 God G2316, and G2532 the name G3686 of the city G4172 of my G3450 God G2316, [which is G3588 ] new G2537 Jerusalem G2419, which G3588 cometh down G2597 (PresActPtc) G2597 (PresActInd) out of G1537 heaven G3772 from G0575 my G3450 God G2316: and G2532 [I will write upon him] my G3450 new G2537 name G3686.
003:013 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577.
003:014 And G2532 unto the angel G0032 of the church G1577 of the Laodiceans G2994 write G1125 (AorActImpr); These things G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Amen G0281, the faithful G4103 and G2532 true G0228 witness G3144, the beginning G0746 of the creation G2937 of God G2316;
003:015 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 works G2041, that G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) neither G3777 cold G5593 nor G3777 hot G2200: I would G3785 thou wert G1498 (PresOpt) cold G5593 or G2228 hot G2200.
003:016 So G3779 then because G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) lukewarm G5513, and G2532 neither G3777 cold G5593 nor G3777 hot G2200, I will G3195 (PresActInd) spue G1692 (AorActInf) thee G4571 out of G1537 my G3450 mouth G4750.
003:017 Because G3754 thou sayest G3004 (PresActInd), G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) rich G4145, and G2532 increased with goods G4147 (PerfActInd), and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 of nothing G3762; and G2532 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) wretched G5005, and G2532 miserable G1652, and G2532 poor G4434, and G2532 blind G5185, and G2532 naked G1131:
003:018 I counsel G4823 (PresActInd) thee G4671 to buy G0059 (AorActInf) of G3844 me G1700 gold G5553 tried G4448 (PerfPasPtc) in G1537 the fire G4442, that G2443 thou mayest be rich G4147 (AorActSubj); and G2532 white G3022 raiment G2440, that G2443 thou mayest be clothed G4016 (Aor2MidSubj), and G2532 [that] the shame G0152 of thy G4675 nakedness G1132 do G5319 not G3361 appear G5319 (AorPasSubj); and G2532 anoint G1472 (AorActImpr) thine G4675 eyes G3788 with eyesalve G2854, that G2443 thou mayest see G0991 (PresActSubj).
003:019 As many as G3745 G1437 I love G5368 (PresActSubj), I G1473 rebuke G1651 (PresActInd) and G2532 chasten G3811 (PresActInd): be zealous G2206 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767, and G2532 repent G3340 (AorActImpr).
003:020 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I stand G2476 (PerfActInd) at G1909 the door G2374, and G2532 knock G2925 (PresActInd): if G1437 any man G5100 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) my G3450 voice G5456, and G2532 open G0455 (AorActSubj) the door G2374, I will come in G1525 (FutMidDepInd) to G4314 him G0846, and G2532 will sup G1172 (FutActInd) with G3326 him G0846, and G2532 he G0846 with G3326 me G1700.
003:021 To him G0846 that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) will I grant G1325 (FutActInd) to sit G2523 (AorActInf) with G3326 me G1700 in G1722 my G3450 throne G2362, even G2504 as G5613 I also G2504 overcame G3528 (AorActInd), and G2532 am set down G2523 (AorActInd) with G3326 my G3450 Father G3962 in G1722 his G0846 throne G2362.
003:022 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the Spirit G4151 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the churches G1577.
004:001 ¶ After G3326 this G5023 I looked G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a door G2374 [was] opened G0455 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 the first G4413 voice G5456 which G3739 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) [was] as it were of G5613 a trumpet G4536 talking G2980 (PresActPtc) with G3326 me G1700; which said G3004 (PresActPtc), Come up G0305 (Aor2ActImpr) hither G5602, and G2532 I will shew G1166 (FutActInd) thee G4671 things which G3739 must G1163 (PresInd) be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) hereafter G3326 G5023.
004:002 And G2532 immediately G2112 I was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the spirit G4151: and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a throne G2362 was set G2749 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) in G1722 heaven G3772, and G2532 [one] sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362.
004:003 And G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) was G2258 (ImpfInd) to look upon G3706 like G3664 a jasper G2393 and G2532 a sardine G4555 stone G3037: and G2532 [there was] a rainbow G2463 round about G2943 the throne G2362, in sight G3706 like G3664 unto an emerald G4664.
004:004 And G2532 round about G2943 the throne G2362 [were] four G5064 and G2532 twenty G1501 seats G2362: and G2532 upon G1909 the seats G2362 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) four G5064 and G2532 twenty G1501 elders G4245 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc), clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 white G3022 raiment G2440; and G2532 they had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 their G0846 heads G2776 crowns G4735 of gold G5552.
004:005 And G2532 out of G1537 the throne G2362 proceeded G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) lightnings G0796 and G2532 thunderings G1027 and G2532 voices G5456: and G2532 [there were] seven G2033 lamps G2985 of fire G4442 burning G2545 (PresPasPtc) before G1799 the throne G2362, which G3739 are G1526 (PresInd) the seven G2033 Spirits G4151 of God G2316.
004:006 And G2532 before G1799 the throne G2362 [there was] a sea G2281 of glass G5193 like G3664 unto crystal G2930: and G2532 in G1722 the midst G3319 of the throne G2362, and G2532 round about G2945 the throne G2362, [were] four G5064 beasts G2226 full G1073 (PresActPtc) of eyes G3788 before G1715 and G2532 behind G3693.
004:007 And G2532 the first G4413 beast G2226 [was] like G3664 a lion G3023, and G2532 the second G1208 beast G2226 like G3664 a calf G3448, and G2532 the third G5154 beast G2226 had G2192 (PresActPtc) a face G4383 as G5613 a man G0444, and G2532 the fourth G5067 beast G2226 [was] like G3664 a flying G4072 (PresMidPasDepPtc) eagle G0105.
004:008 And G2532 the four G5064 beasts G2226 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) each G0303 G1520 of them G2596 G1438 six G1803 wings G4420 about G2943 [him]; and G2532 [they were] full G1073 (PresActPtc) of eyes G3788 within G2081: and G2532 they rest G0372 not G3756 G2192 (PresActInd) day G2250 and G2532 night G3571, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Holy G0040, holy G0040, holy G0040, Lord G2962 God G2316 Almighty G3841, which G3588 was G2258 (ImpfInd) G3801, and G2532 is G5607 (PresPtc) G3801, and G2532 is to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G3801.
004:009 And G2532 when G3752 those beasts G2226 give G1325 (FutActInd) glory G1391 and G2532 honour G5092 and G2532 thanks G2169 to him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362, who G3588 liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165,
004:010 The four G5064 and G2532 twenty G1501 elders G4245 fall down G4098 (FutMidPasDepInd) before G1799 him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362, and G2532 worship G4352 (PresActInd) him that liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165, and G2532 cast G0906 (PresActInd) their G0846 crowns G4735 before G1799 the throne G2362, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
004:011 Thou art G1488 (PresInd) worthy G0514, O Lord G2962, to receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) glory G1391 and G2532 honour G5092 and G2532 power G1411: for G3754 thou G4771 hast created G2936 (AorActInd) all things G3956, and G2532 for G1223 thy G4675 pleasure G2307 they are G1526 (PresInd) and G2532 were created G2936 (AorPasInd).
005:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G1909 the right hand G1188 of him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362 a book G0975 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) within G2081 and G2532 on the backside G3693, sealed G2696 (PerfPasPtc) with seven G2033 seals G4973.
005:002 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a strong G2478 angel G0032 proclaiming G2784 (PresActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) worthy G0514 to open G0455 (AorActInf) the book G0975, and G2532 to loose G3089 (AorActInf) the seals G4973 thereof G0846?
005:003 And G2532 no man G3762 in G1722 heaven G3772, nor G3761 in G1909 earth G1093, neither G3761 under G5270 the earth G1093, was able G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to open G0455 (AorActInf) the book G0975, neither G3761 to look G0991 (PresActInf) thereon G0846.
005:004 And G2532 I G1473 wept G2799 (ImpfActInd) much G4183, because G3754 no man G3762 was found G2147 (AorPasInd) worthy G0514 to open G0455 (AorActInf) and G2532 to read G0314 (Aor2ActInf) the book G0975, neither G3777 to look G0991 (PresActInf) thereon G0846.
005:005 And G2532 one G1520 of G1537 the elders G4245 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Weep G2799 (PresActImpr) not G3361: behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the Lion G3023 of G5607 (PresPtc) G1537 the tribe G5443 of Juda G2455, the Root G4491 of David G1138, hath prevailed G3528 (AorActInd) to open G0455 (AorActInf) the book G0975, and G2532 to loose G3089 (AorActInf) the seven G2033 seals G4973 thereof G0846.
005:006 And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), in G1722 the midst G3319 of the throne G2362 and G2532 of the four G5064 beasts G2226, and G2532 in G1722 the midst G3319 of the elders G4245, stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) a Lamb G0721 as G5613 it had been slain G4969 (PerfPasPtc), having G2192 (PresActPtc) seven G2033 horns G2768 and G2532 seven G2033 eyes G3788, which G3739 are G1526 (PresInd) the seven G2033 Spirits G4151 of God G2316 sent forth G0649 (PerfPasPtc) into G1519 all G3956 the earth G1093.
005:007 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 took G2983 (PerfActInd) the book G0975 out of G1537 the right hand G1188 of him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the throne G2362.
005:008 And G2532 when G3753 he had taken G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the book G0975, the four G5064 beasts G2226 and G2532 four G5064 [and] twenty G1501 elders G4245 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 the Lamb G0721, having G2192 (PresActPtc) every one of them G1538 harps G2788, and G2532 golden G5552 vials G5357 full G1073 (PresActPtc) of odours G2368, which G3739 are G1526 (PresInd) the prayers G4335 of saints G0040.
005:009 And G2532 they sung G0103 (PresActInd) a new G2537 song G5603, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Thou art G1488 (PresInd) worthy G0514 to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) the book G0975, and G2532 to open G0455 (AorActInf) the seals G4973 thereof G0846: for G3754 thou wast slain G4969 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 hast redeemed G0059 (AorActInd) us G2248 to God G2316 by G1722 thy G4675 blood G0129 out of G1537 every G3956 kindred G5443, and G2532 tongue G1100, and G2532 people G2992, and G2532 nation G1484;
005:010 And G2532 hast made G4160 (AorActInd) us G2248 unto our G2257 God G2316 kings G0935 and G2532 priests G2409: and G2532 we shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) on G1909 the earth G1093.
005:011 And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the voice G5456 of many G4183 angels G0032 round about G2943 the throne G2362 and G2532 the beasts G2226 and G2532 the elders G4245: and G2532 the number G0706 of them G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) ten thousand G3461 times ten thousand G3461, and G2532 thousands G5505 of thousands G5505;
005:012 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Worthy G0514 is G2076 (PresInd) the Lamb G0721 that was slain G4969 (PerfPasPtc) to receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) power G1411, and G2532 riches G4149, and G2532 wisdom G4678, and G2532 strength G2479, and G2532 honour G5092, and G2532 glory G1391, and G2532 blessing G2129.
005:013 And G2532 every G3956 creature G2938 which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 heaven G3772, and G2532 on G1722 the earth G1093, and G2532 under G5270 the earth G1093, and G2532 such as G3739 are G2076 (PresInd) in G1909 the sea G2281, and G2532 all G3956 that are in G1722 them G0846, heard I G0191 (AorActInd) saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Blessing G2129, and G2532 honour G5092, and G2532 glory G1391, and G2532 power G2904, [be] unto him that sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the throne G2362, and G2532 unto the Lamb G0721 for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
005:014 And G2532 the four G5064 beasts G2226 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Amen G0281. And G2532 the four G5064 [and] twenty G1501 elders G4245 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him that liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
006:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) when G3753 the Lamb G0721 opened G0455 (AorActInd) one G3391 of G1537 the seals G4973, and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd), as it were G5613 the noise G5456 of thunder G1027, one G1520 of G1537 the four G5064 beasts G2226 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G0991 (PresActImpr).
006:002 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a white G3022 horse G2462: and G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 him G0846 had G2192 (PresActPtc) a bow G5115; and G2532 a crown G4735 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846: and G2532 he went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) conquering G3528 (PresActPtc), and G2532 to G2443 conquer G3528 (AorActSubj).
006:003 And G2532 when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the second G1208 seal G4973, I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the second G1208 beast G2226 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G0991 (PresActImpr).
006:004 And G2532 there went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 horse G2462 [that was] red G4450: and G2532 [power] was given G1325 (AorPasInd) to him G0846 that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thereon G1909 G0846 to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) peace G1515 from G0575 the earth G1093, and G2532 that G2443 they should kill G4969 (AorActSubj) one another G0240: and G2532 there was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 a great G3173 sword G3162.
006:005 And G2532 when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the third G5154 seal G4973, I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the third G5154 beast G2226 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G0991 (PresActImpr). And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a black G3189 horse G2462; and G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 him G0846 had G2192 (PresActPtc) a pair of balances G2218 in G1722 his G0846 hand G5495.
006:006 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 in G1722 the midst G3319 of the four G5064 beasts G2226 say G3004 (PresActPtc), A measure G5518 of wheat G4621 for a penny G1220, and G2532 three G5140 measures G5518 of barley G2915 for a penny G1220; and G2532 [see] thou hurt G0091 (AorActSubj) not G3361 the oil G1637 and G2532 the wine G3631.
006:007 And G2532 when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the fourth G5067 seal G4973, I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the voice G5456 of the fourth G5067 beast G2226 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G0991 (PresActImpr).
006:008 And G2532 I looked G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a pale G5515 horse G2462: and G2532 his G0846 name G3686 that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1883 him G0846 was Death G2288, and G2532 Hell G0086 followed G0190 (PresActInd) with G3326 him G0846. And G2532 power G1849 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846 over G1909 the fourth part G5067 of the earth G1093, to kill G0615 (AorActInf) with G1722 sword G4501, and G2532 with G1722 hunger G3042, and G2532 with G1722 death G2288, and G2532 with G5259 the beasts G2342 of the earth G1093.
006:009 And G2532 when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the fifth G3991 seal G4973, I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) under G5270 the altar G2379 the souls G5590 of them that were slain G4969 (PerfPasPtc) for G1223 the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 for G1223 the testimony G3141 which G3739 they held G2192 (ImpfActInd):
006:010 And G2532 they cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), How G2193 long G4219, O Lord G1203, holy G0040 and G2532 true G0228, dost thou G2919 not G3756 judge G2919 (PresActInd) and G2532 avenge G1556 (PresActInd) our G2257 blood G0129 on G0575 them that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093?
006:011 And G2532 white G3022 robes G4749 were given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto every one of them G1538; and G2532 it was said G4483 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846, that G2443 they should rest G0373 (AorMidSubj) yet G2089 for a little G3398 season G5550, until G2193 their G0846 fellowservants G4889 also G2532 and G2532 their G0846 brethren G0080, that should G3195 (PresActPtc) be killed G0615 (PresPasInf) as G5613 G2532 they G0846 [were], should G3739 be fulfilled G4137 (FutMidDepInd).
006:012 And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd) when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the sixth G1623 seal G4973, and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 earthquake G4578; and G2532 the sun G2246 became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) black G3189 as G5613 sackcloth G4526 of hair G5155, and G2532 the moon G4582 became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5613 blood G0129;
006:013 And G2532 the stars G0792 of heaven G3772 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 the earth G1093, even as G5613 a fig tree G4808 casteth G0906 (PresActInd) her G0846 untimely figs G3653, when she is shaken G4579 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 a mighty G3173 wind G0417.
006:014 And G2532 the heaven G3772 departed G0673 (AorPasInd) as G5613 a scroll G0975 when it is rolled together G1507 (PresPasPtc); and G2532 every G3956 mountain G3735 and G2532 island G3520 were moved G2795 (AorPasInd) out of G1537 their G0846 places G5117.
006:015 And G2532 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093, and G2532 the great men G3175, and G2532 the rich men G4145, and G2532 the chief captains G5506, and G2532 the mighty men G1415, and G2532 every G3956 bondman G1401, and G2532 every G3956 free man G1658, hid G2928 (AorActInd) themselves G1438 in G1519 the dens G4693 and G2532 in G1519 the rocks G4073 of the mountains G3735;
006:016 And G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) to the mountains G3735 and G2532 rocks G4073, Fall G4098 (Aor2ActImpr) on G1909 us G2248, and G2532 hide G2928 (AorActImpr) us G2248 from G0575 the face G4383 of him that sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362, and G2532 from G0575 the wrath G3709 of the Lamb G0721:
006:017 For G3754 the great G3173 day G2250 of his G0846 wrath G3709 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 who G5101 shall be able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to stand G2476 (AorPasInf)?
007:001 ¶ And G2532 after G3326 these things G5023 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) four G5064 angels G0032 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1909 the four G5064 corners G1137 of the earth G1093, holding G2902 (PresActPtc) the four G5064 winds G0417 of the earth G1093, that G3363 the wind G0417 should G4154 not G3363 blow G4154 (PresActSubj) on G1909 the earth G1093, nor G3383 on G1909 the sea G2281, nor G3383 on G1909 any G3956 tree G1186.
007:002 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 angel G0032 ascending G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) G0305 (PresActPtc) from G0575 the east G0395 G2246, having G2192 (PresActPtc) the seal G4973 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316: and G2532 he cried G2896 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456 to the four G5064 angels G0032, to whom G3739 it G0846 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) to hurt G0091 (AorActInf) the earth G1093 and G2532 the sea G2281,
007:003 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hurt G0091 (AorActSubj) not G3361 the earth G1093, neither G3383 the sea G2281, nor G3383 the trees G1186, till G0891 G3739 we have sealed G4972 (PresActSubj) G4972 (AorActSubj) the servants G1401 of our G2257 God G2316 in G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359.
007:004 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the number G0706 of them which were sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc): [and there were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) an hundred G1540 [and] forty G5062 [and] four G5064 thousand G5505 of G1537 all G3956 the tribes G5443 of the children G5207 of Israel G2474.
007:005 Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Juda G2455 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Reuben G4502 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Gad G1045 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505.
007:006 Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Aser G0768 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Nepthalim G3508 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Manasses G3128 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505.
007:007 Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Simeon G4826 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Levi G3017 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Issachar G2466 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505.
007:008 Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Zabulon G2194 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Joseph G2501 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505. Of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Benjamin G0958 [were] sealed G4972 (PerfPasPtc) twelve G1427 thousand G5505.
007:009 After G3326 this G5023 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a great G4183 multitude G3793, which G3739 no man G3762 could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) number G0705 (AorActInf) G0846, of G1537 all G3956 nations G1484, and G2532 kindreds G5443, and G2532 people G2992, and G2532 tongues G1100, stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) before G1799 the throne G2362, and G2532 before G1799 the Lamb G0721, clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) with white G3022 robes G4749, and G2532 palms G5404 in G1722 their G0846 hands G5495;
007:010 And G2532 cried G2896 (PresActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Salvation G4991 to our G2257 God G2316 which G3588 sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the throne G2362, and G2532 unto the Lamb G0721.
007:011 And G2532 all G3956 the angels G0032 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) round about G2945 the throne G2362, and G2532 [about] the elders G4245 and G2532 the four G5064 beasts G2226, and G2532 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 the throne G2362 on G1909 their G0846 faces G4383, and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) God G2316,
007:012 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Amen G0281: Blessing G2129, and G2532 glory G1391, and G2532 wisdom G4678, and G2532 thanksgiving G2169, and G2532 honour G5092, and G2532 power G1411, and G2532 might G2479, [be] unto our G2257 God G2316 for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165. Amen G0281.
007:013 And G2532 one G1520 of G1537 the elders G4245 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, What G5101 are G1526 (PresInd) these G3778 which G3588 are arrayed in G4016 (PerfPasPtc) white G3022 robes G4749? and G2532 whence G4159 came they G2064 (Aor2ActInd)?
007:014 And G2532 I said G2046 (PerfActInd) unto him G0846, Sir G2962, thou G4771 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd). And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to me G3427, These G3778 are they G1526 (PresInd) which came G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 great G3173 tribulation G2347, and G2532 have washed G4150 (AorActInd) their G0846 robes G4749, and G2532 made G3021 them G4749 G0846 white G3021 (AorActInd) in G1722 the blood G0129 of the Lamb G0721.
007:015 Therefore G1223 G5124 are they G1526 (PresInd) before G1799 the throne G2362 of God G2316, and G2532 serve G3000 (PresActInd) him G0846 day G2250 and G2532 night G3571 in G1722 his G0846 temple G3485: and G2532 he that sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362 shall dwell G4637 (FutActInd) among G1909 them G0846.
007:016 They shall hunger G3983 (FutActInd) no G3756 more G2089, neither G3761 thirst G1372 (FutActInd) any more G2089; neither G3761 G3361 shall G4098 the sun G2246 light G4098 (Aor2ActSubj) on G1909 them G0846, nor G3761 any G3956 heat G2738.
007:017 For G3754 the Lamb G0721 which G3588 is in the midst G0303 G3319 of the throne G2362 shall feed G4165 (FutActInd) them G0846, and G2532 shall lead G3594 (FutActInd) them G0846 unto G1909 living G2198 (PresActPtc) fountains G4077 of waters G5204: and G2532 God G2316 shall wipe away G1813 (FutActInd) all G3956 tears G1144 from G0575 their G0846 eyes G3788.
008:001 ¶ And G2532 when G3753 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the seventh G1442 seal G4973, there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) silence G4602 in G1722 heaven G3772 about the space of G5613 half an hour G2256.
008:002 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the seven G2033 angels G0032 which G3739 stood G2476 (PerfActInd) before G1799 God G2316; and G2532 to them G0846 were given G1325 (AorPasInd) seven G2033 trumpets G4536.
008:003 And G2532 another G0243 angel G0032 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 stood G2476 (AorPasInd) at G1909 the altar G2379, having G2192 (PresActPtc) a golden G5552 censer G3031; and G2532 there was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 much G4183 incense G2368, that G2443 he should offer G1325 (AorActSubj) [it] with the prayers G4335 of all G3956 saints G0040 upon G1909 the golden G5552 altar G2379 which G3588 was before G1799 the throne G2362.
008:004 And G2532 the smoke G2586 of the incense G2368, [which came] with the prayers G4335 of the saints G0040, ascended up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 God G2316 out of G1537 the angel’s G0032 hand G5495.
008:005 And G2532 the angel G0032 took G2983 (PerfActInd) the censer G3031, and G2532 filled G1072 (AorActInd) it G0846 with G1537 fire G4442 of the altar G2379, and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) [it] into G1519 the earth G1093: and G2532 there were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) voices G5456, and G2532 thunderings G1027, and G2532 lightnings G0796, and G2532 an earthquake G4578.
008:006 And G2532 the seven G2033 angels G0032 which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 trumpets G4536 prepared G2090 (AorActInd) themselves G1438 to G2443 sound G4537 (AorActSubj).
008:007  G2532 The first G4413 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 there followed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) hail G5464 and G2532 fire G4442 mingled G3396 (PerfPasPtc) with blood G0129, and G2532 they were cast G0906 (AorPasInd) upon G1519 the earth G1093: and G2532 the third part G5154 of trees G1186 was burnt up G2618 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 all G3956 green G5515 grass G5528 was burnt up G2618 (Aor2PasDepSubj).
008:008 And G2532 the second G1208 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 as it were G5613 a great G3173 mountain G3735 burning G2545 (PresPasPtc) with fire G4442 was cast G0906 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the sea G2281: and G2532 the third part G5154 of the sea G2281 became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) blood G0129;
008:009 And G2532 the third part G5154 of the creatures G2938 which G3588 were in G1722 the sea G2281, and had G2192 (PresActPtc) life G5590, died G0599 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 the third part G5154 of the ships G4143 were destroyed G1311 (Aor2PasDepSubj).
008:010 And G2532 the third G5154 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 there fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) a great G3173 star G0792 from G1537 heaven G3772, burning G2545 (PresPasPtc) as it were G5613 a lamp G2985, and G2532 it fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 the third part G5154 of the rivers G4215, and G2532 upon G1909 the fountains G4077 of waters G5204;
008:011 And G2532 the name G3686 of the star G0792 is called G3004 (PresPasInd) Wormwood G0894: and G2532 the third part G5154 of the waters G5204 became G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) G1519 wormwood G0894; and G2532 many G4183 men G0444 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) of G1537 the waters G5204, because G3754 they were made bitter G4087 (AorPasInd).
008:012 And G2532 the fourth G5067 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 the third part G5154 of the sun G2246 was smitten G4141 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 the third part G5154 of the moon G4582, and G2532 the third part G5154 of the stars G0792; so as G2443 the third part G5154 of them G0846 was darkened G4654 (AorPasSubj), and G2532 the day G2250 shone G5316 (PresActSubj) not G3361 for a third part G5154 of it G0846, and G2532 the night G3571 likewise G3668.
008:013 And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd) an G1520 angel G0032 flying G4072 (PresMidPasDepPtc) through G1722 the midst of heaven G3321, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Woe G3759, woe G3759, woe G3759, to the inhabiters G2730 (PresActPtc) of G1909 the earth G1093 by reason of G1537 the other G3062 voices G5456 of the trumpet G4536 of the three G5140 angels G0032, which G3588 are yet G3195 (PresActPtc) to sound G4537 (PresActInf)!
009:001 ¶ And G2532 the fifth G3991 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a star G0792 fall G4098 (PerfActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772 unto G1519 the earth G1093: and G2532 to him G0846 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) the key G2807 of the bottomless G0012 pit G5421.
009:002 And G2532 he opened G0455 (AorActInd) the bottomless G0012 pit G5421; and G2532 there arose G0305 (Aor2ActInd) a smoke G2586 out of G1537 the pit G5421, as G5613 the smoke G2586 of a great G3173 furnace G2575; and G2532 the sun G2246 and G2532 the air G0109 were darkened G4654 (AorPasInd) by reason of G1537 the smoke G2586 of the pit G5421.
009:003 And G2532 there came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the smoke G2586 locusts G0200 upon G1519 the earth G1093: and G2532 unto them G0846 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) power G1849, as G5613 the scorpions G4651 of the earth G1093 have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849.
009:004 And G2532 it was commanded G4483 (AorPasInd) them G0846 that G3363 they should G0091 not G3363 hurt G0091 (AorActSubj) the grass G5528 of the earth G1093, neither G3761 any G3956 green thing G5515, neither G3761 any G3956 tree G1186; but G1508 only G3441 those men G0444 which G3748 have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 the seal G4973 of God G2316 in G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359.
009:005 And G2532 to them G0846 it was given G1325 (AorPasInd) that G3363 they should G0615 not G3363 kill G0615 (PresActSubj) them G0846, but G0235 that G2443 they should be tormented G0928 (AorPasSubj) five G4002 months G3376: and G2532 their G0846 torment G0929 [was] as G5613 the torment G0929 of a scorpion G4651, when G3752 he striketh G3817 (AorActSubj) a man G0444.
009:006 And G2532 in G1722 those G1565 days G2250 shall men G0444 seek G2212 (FutActInd) death G2288, and G2532 shall G2147 not G3756 find G2147 (FutActInd) it G0846; and G2532 shall desire G1937 (FutActInd) to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 death G2288 shall flee G5343 (FutMidDepInd) from G0575 them G0846.
009:007 And G2532 the shapes G3667 of the locusts G0200 [were] like G3664 unto horses G2462 prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1519 battle G4171; and G2532 on G1909 their G0846 heads G2776 [were] as it were G5613 crowns G4735 like G3664 gold G5557, and G2532 their G0846 faces G4383 [were] as G5613 the faces G4383 of men G0444.
009:008 And G2532 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) hair G2359 as G5613 the hair G2359 of women G1135, and G2532 their G0846 teeth G3599 were G2258 (ImpfInd) as G5613 [the teeth] of lions G3023.
009:009 And G2532 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) breastplates G2382, as it were G5613 breastplates G2382 of iron G4603; and G2532 the sound G5456 of their G0846 wings G4420 [was] as G5613 the sound G5456 of chariots G0716 of many G4183 horses G2462 running G5143 (PresActPtc) to G1519 battle G4171.
009:010 And G2532 they had G2192 (PresActInd) tails G3769 like G3664 unto scorpions G4651, and G2532 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) stings G2759 in G1722 their G0846 tails G3769: and G2532 their G0846 power G1849 [was] to hurt G0091 (AorActInf) men G0444 five G4002 months G3376.
009:011 And G2532 they had G2192 (PresActInd) a king G0935 over G1909 them G0848, [which is] the angel G0032 of the bottomless pit G0012, whose G0846 name G3686 in the Hebrew tongue G1447 [is] Abaddon G0003, but G2532 in G1722 the Greek tongue G1673 hath G2192 (PresActInd) [his] name G3686 Apollyon G0623.
009:012 One G3391 woe G3759 is past G0565 (Aor2ActInd); [and], behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) two G1417 woes G3759 more G2089 hereafter G3326 G5023.
009:013 And G2532 the sixth G1623 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd), and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a G3391 voice G5456 from G1537 the four G5064 horns G2768 of the golden G5552 altar G2379 which G3588 is before G1799 God G2316,
009:014 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc) to the sixth G1623 angel G0032 which G3739 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) the trumpet G4536, Loose G3089 (AorActImpr) the four G5064 angels G0032 which G3588 are bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) in G1909 the great G3173 river G4215 Euphrates G2166.
009:015 And G2532 the four G5064 angels G0032 were loosed G3089 (AorPasInd), which G3588 were prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) for G1519 an hour G5610, and G2532 a day G2250, and G2532 a month G3376, and G2532 a year G1763, for to G2443 slay G0615 (PresActSubj) the third part G5154 of men G0444.
009:016 And G2532 the number G0706 of the army G4753 of the horsemen G2461 [were] two hundred G1417 thousand G3461 thousand G3461: and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the number G0706 of them G0846.
009:017 And G2532 thus G3779 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the horses G2462 in G1722 the vision G3706, and G2532 them that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 them G0846, having G2192 (PresActPtc) breastplates G2382 of fire G4447, and G2532 of jacinth G5191, and G2532 brimstone G2306: and G2532 the heads G2776 of the horses G2462 [were] as G5613 the heads G2776 of lions G3023; and G2532 out of G1537 their G0846 mouths G4750 issued G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) fire G4442 and G2532 smoke G2586 and G2532 brimstone G2303.
009:018 By G5259 these G5130 three G5140 was G0615 the third part G5154 of men G0444 killed G0615 (AorPasInd), by G1537 the fire G4442, and G2532 by G1537 the smoke G2586, and G2532 by G1537 the brimstone G2303, which G3588 issued G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 their G0846 mouths G4750.
009:019 For G1063 their G0846 power G1849 is G1526 (PresInd) G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 their G0846 mouth G4750, and G2532 in G1722 their G0846 tails G3769: for G1063 their G0846 tails G3769 [were] like G3664 unto serpents G3789, and had G2192 (PresActPtc) heads G2776, and G2532 with G1722 them G0846 they do hurt G0091 (PresActInd).
009:020 And G2532 the rest G3062 of the men G0444 which G3739 were G0615 not G3756 killed G0615 (AorPasInd) by G1722 these G5025 plagues G4127 yet G3777 repented G3340 (AorActInd) not G3777 of G1537 the works G2041 of their G0846 hands G5495, that G3363 they should G4352 not G3363 worship G4352 (AorActSubj) devils G1140, and G2532 idols G1497 of gold G5552, and G2532 silver G0693, and G2532 brass G5470, and G2532 stone G3035, and G2532 of wood G3585: which G3739 neither G3777 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) see G0991 (PresActInf), nor G3777 hear G0191 (PresActInf), nor G3777 walk G4043 (PresActInf):
009:021 Neither G2532 G3756 repented they G3340 (AorActInd) of G1537 their G0846 murders G5408, nor G3777 of G1537 their G0846 sorceries G5331, nor G3777 of G1537 their G0846 fornication G4202, nor G3777 of G1537 their G0846 thefts G2809.
010:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 mighty G2478 angel G0032 come down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) with a cloud G3507: and G2532 a rainbow G2463 [was] upon G1909 his G0846 head G2776, and G2532 his G0846 face G4383 [was] as it were G5613 the sun G2246, and G2532 his G0846 feet G4228 as G5613 pillars G4769 of fire G4442:
010:002 And G2532 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 his G0846 hand G5495 a little book G0974 open G0455 (PerfPasPtc): and G2532 he set G5087 (AorActInd) his G0846 right G1188 foot G4228 upon G1909 the sea G2281, and G1161 [his] left G2176 [foot] on G1909 the earth G1093,
010:003 And G2532 cried G2896 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, as G5618 [when] a lion G3023 roareth G3455 (PresMidPasDepInd): and G2532 when G3753 he had cried G2896 (AorActInd), seven G2033 thunders G1027 uttered G2980 (AorActInd) their G1438 voices G5456.
010:004 And G2532 when G3753 the seven G2033 thunders G1027 had uttered G2980 (AorActInd) their G1438 voices G5456, I was about G3195 (ImpfActInd) to write G1125 (PresActInf): and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Seal up G4972 (AorActImpr) those things which G3739 the seven G2033 thunders G1027 uttered G2980 (AorActInd), and G2532 write G1125 (AorActSubj) them G5023 not G3361.
010:005 And G2532 the angel G0032 which G3739 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) stand G2476 (PerfActPtc) upon G1909 the sea G2281 and G2532 upon G1909 the earth G1093 lifted up G0142 (AorActInd) his G0846 hand G5495 to G1519 heaven G3772,
010:006 And G2532 sware G3660 (AorActInd) by G1722 him that liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165, who G3739 created G2936 (AorActInd) heaven G3772, and G2532 the things that therein are G1722 G0846, and G2532 the earth G1093, and G2532 the things that therein are G1722 G0846, and G2532 the sea G2281, and G2532 the things which are therein G1722 G0846, that G3754 there should be G2071 (FutInd) time G5550 no G3756 longer G2089:
010:007 But G0235 in G1722 the days G2250 of the voice G5456 of the seventh G1442 angel G0032, when G3752 he shall begin G3195 (PresActSubj) to sound G4537 (PresActInf), G2532 the mystery G3466 of God G2316 should be finished G5055 (AorPasSubj), as G5613 he hath declared G2097 (AorActInd) to his G1438 servants G1401 the prophets G4396.
010:008 And G2532 the voice G5456 which G3739 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) from G1537 heaven G3772 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) unto G3326 me G1700 again G3825, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActPtc), Go G5217 (PresActImpr) [and] take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) the little book G0974 which G3588 is open G0455 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the hand G5495 of the angel G0032 which G3588 standeth G2476 (PerfActPtc) upon G1909 the sea G2281 and G2532 upon G1909 the earth G1093.
010:009 And G2532 I went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the angel G0032, and said G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 the little book G0974. And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) [it], and G2532 eat G2719 it G0846 up G2719 (Aor2ActImpr); and it G2532 shall make G4087 thy G4675 belly G2836 bitter G4087 (FutActInd), but G0235 it shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 thy G4675 mouth G4750 sweet G1099 as G5613 honey G3192.
010:010 And G2532 I took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the little book G0974 out of G1537 the angel’s G0032 hand G5495, and G2532 ate G2719 it G0846 up G2719 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 my G3450 mouth G4750 sweet G1099 as G5613 honey G3192: and G2532 as soon as G3753 I had eaten G5315 (Aor2ActInd) it G0846, my G3450 belly G2836 was bitter G4087 (AorPasInd).
010:011 And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Thou G4571 must G1163 (PresInd) prophesy G4395 (AorActInf) again G3825 before G1909 many G4183 peoples G2992, and G2532 nations G1484, and G2532 tongues G1100, and G2532 kings G0935.
011:001 ¶ And G2532 there was given G1325 (AorPasInd) me G3427 a reed G2563 like G3664 unto a rod G4464: and G2532 the angel G0032 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Rise G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 measure G3354 (AorActImpr) the temple G3485 of God G2316, and G2532 the altar G2379, and G2532 them that worship G4352 (PresActPtc) therein G1722 G0846.
011:002 But G2532 the court G0833 which G3588 is without G1855 G2081 the temple G3485 leave G1544 (Aor2ActImpr) out G1854, and G2532 measure G3354 (AorActSubj) it G0846 not G3361; for G3754 it is given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto the Gentiles G1484: and G2532 the holy G0040 city G4172 shall they tread under foot G3961 (FutActInd) forty G5062 [and] two G1417 months G3376.
011:003 And G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) [power] unto my G3450 two G1417 witnesses G3144, and G2532 they shall prophesy G4395 (FutActInd) a thousand G5507 two hundred G1250 [and] threescore G1835 days G2250, clothed in G4016 (PerfPasPtc) sackcloth G4526.
011:004 These G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) the two G1417 olive G1636 trees, and G2532 the two G1417 candlesticks G3087 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) before G1799 the God G2316 of the earth G1093.
011:005 And G2532 if any man G1536 G0846 will G2309 (PresActSubj) hurt G0091 (AorActInf) them G0846, fire G4442 proceedeth G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) out of G1537 their G0846 mouth G4750, and G2532 devoureth G2719 (PresActInd) their G0846 enemies G2190: and G2532 if any man G1536 will G2309 (PresActSubj) hurt G0091 (AorActInf) them G0846, he must G1163 (PresInd) in this manner G3779 be killed G0615 (AorPasInf).
011:006 These G3778 have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to shut G2808 (AorActInf) heaven G3772, that G3363 it rain G1026 (PresActSubj) G5205 not G3363 in G1722 the days G2250 of their G0846 prophecy G4394: and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 over G1909 waters G5204 to turn G4762 (PresActInf) them G0846 to G1519 blood G0129, and G2532 to smite G3960 (AorActInf) the earth G1093 with all G3956 plagues G4127, as often G3740 as G1437 they will G2309 (AorActSubj).
011:007 And G2532 when G3752 they shall have finished G5055 (AorActSubj) their G0846 testimony G3141, the beast G2342 that ascendeth G0305 (PresActPtc) out of G1537 the bottomless pit G0012 shall make G4160 (FutActInd) war G4171 against G3326 them G0846, and G2532 shall overcome G3528 (FutActInd) them G0846, and G2532 kill G0615 (FutActInd) them G0846.
011:008 And G2532 their G0846 dead bodies G4430 [shall lie] in G1909 the street G4113 of the great G3173 city G4172, which G3748 spiritually G4153 is called G2564 (PresPasInd) Sodom G4670 and G2532 Egypt G0125, where G3699 also G2532 our G2257 Lord G2962 was crucified G4717 (AorPasInd).
011:009 And G2532 they G0991 of G1537 the people G2992 and G2532 kindreds G5443 and G2532 tongues G1100 and G2532 nations G1484 shall see G0991 (FutActInd) their G0846 dead bodies G4430 three G5140 days G2250 and G2532 an half G2255, and G2532 shall G0863 not G3756 suffer G0863 (FutActInd) their G0846 dead bodies G4430 to be put G5087 (AorPasInf) in G1519 graves G3418.
011:010 And G2532 they that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the earth G1093 shall rejoice G5463 (FutActInd) over G1909 them G0846, and G2532 make merry G2165 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall send G3992 (FutActInd) gifts G1435 one to another G0240; because G3754 these G3778 two G1417 prophets G4396 tormented G0928 (AorActInd) them that dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093.
011:011 And G2532 after G3326 three G5140 days G2250 and G2532 an half G2255 the Spirit G4151 of life G2222 from G1537 God G2316 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 them G0846, and G2532 they stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 their G0846 feet G4228; and G2532 great G3173 fear G5401 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 them which saw G2334 (PresActPtc) them G0846.
011:012 And G2532 they heard G0191 (AorActInd) a great G3173 voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Come up G0305 (Aor2ActImpr) hither G5602. And G2532 they ascended up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 heaven G3772 in G1722 a cloud G3507; and G2532 their G0846 enemies G2190 beheld G2334 (AorActInd) them G0846.
011:013 And G2532 the same G1722 G1565 hour G5610 was there G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 earthquake G4578, and G2532 the tenth part G1182 of the city G4172 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 in G1722 the earthquake G4578 were slain G0615 (AorPasInd) G3686 of men G0444 seven G2033 thousand G5505: and G2532 the remnant G3062 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) affrighted G1719, and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) glory G1391 to the God G2316 of heaven G3772.
011:014 The second G1208 woe G3759 is past G0565 (Aor2ActInd); [and G2532 ], behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the third G5154 woe G3759 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) quickly G5035.
011:015 And G2532 the seventh G1442 angel G0032 sounded G4537 (AorActInd); and G2532 there were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) great G3173 voices G5456 in G1722 heaven G3772, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The kingdoms G0932 of this world G2889 are become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) [the kingdoms] of our G2257 Lord G2962, and G2532 of his G0846 Christ G5547; and G2532 he shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
011:016 And G2532 the four G5064 and G2532 twenty G1501 elders G4245, which G3588 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) before G1799 God G2316 on G1909 their G0846 seats G2362, fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 their G0846 faces G4383, and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) God G2316,
011:017 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We give G2168 thee G4671 thanks G2168 (PresActInd), O Lord G2962 God G2316 Almighty G3841, which G3588 art G5607 (PresPtc) G3801, and G2532 wast G2258 (ImpfInd) G3801, and G2532 art to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G3801; because G3754 thou hast taken to thee G2983 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 great G3173 power G1411, and G2532 hast reigned G0936 (AorActInd).
011:018 And G2532 the nations G1484 were angry G3710 (AorPasInd), and G2532 thy G4675 wrath G3709 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the time G2540 of the dead G3498, that they should be judged G2919 (AorPasInf), and G2532 that thou shouldest give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) reward G3408 unto thy G4675 servants G1401 the prophets G4396, and G2532 to the saints G0040, and G2532 them that fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thy G4675 name G3686, small G3398 and G2532 great G3173; and G2532 shouldest destroy G1311 (AorActInf) them which destroy G1311 (PresActPtc) the earth G1093.
011:019 And G2532 the temple G3485 of God G2316 was opened G0455 (Aor2PasDepSubj) in G1722 heaven G3772, and G2532 there was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) in G1722 his G0846 temple G3485 the ark G2787 of his G0846 testament G1242: and G2532 there were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) lightnings G0796, and G2532 voices G5456, and G2532 thunderings G1027, and G2532 an earthquake G4578, and G2532 great G3173 hail G5464.
012:001 ¶ And G2532 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) a great G3173 wonder G4592 in G1722 heaven G3772; a woman G1135 clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) with the sun G2246, and G2532 the moon G4582 under G5270 her G0846 feet G4228, and G2532 upon G1909 her G0846 head G2776 a crown G4735 of twelve G1427 stars G0792:
012:002 And G2532 she being G2192 (PresActPtc) with G1722 child G1064 cried G2896 (PresActInd), travailing in birth G5605 (PresActPtc), and G2532 pained G0928 (PresPasPtc) to be delivered G5088 (Aor2ActInf).
012:003 And G2532 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) another G0243 wonder G4592 in G1722 heaven G3772; and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a great G3173 red G4450 dragon G1404, having G2192 (PresActPtc) seven G2033 heads G2776 and G2532 ten G1176 horns G2768, and G2532 seven G2033 crowns G1238 upon G1909 his G0846 heads G2776.
012:004 And G2532 his G0846 tail G3769 drew G4951 (PresActInd) the third part G5154 of the stars G0792 of heaven G3772, and G2532 did cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 to G1519 the earth G1093: and G2532 the dragon G1404 stood G2476 (ImpfActInd) before G1799 the woman G1135 which G3588 was ready G3195 (PresActPtc) to be delivered G5088 (Aor2ActInf), for G2443 to devour G2719 (Aor2ActSubj) her G0846 child G5043 as soon as G3752 it was born G5088 (Aor2ActSubj).
012:005 And G2532 she brought forth G5088 (Aor2ActInd) a man G0730 child G5207, who G3739 was G3195 (PresActInd) to rule G4165 (PresActInf) all G3956 nations G1484 with G1722 a rod G4464 of iron G4603: and G2532 her G0846 child G5043 was caught up G0726 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 God G2316, and G2532 [to] his G0846 throne G2362.
012:006 And G2532 the woman G1135 fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the wilderness G2048, where G3699 she hath G2192 (PresActInd) a place G5117 prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) of G0575 God G2316, that G2443 they should feed G5142 (PresActSubj) her G0846 there G1563 a thousand G5507 two hundred G1250 [and] threescore G1835 days G2250.
012:007 And G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) war G4171 in G1722 heaven G3772: Michael G3413 and G2532 his G0846 angels G0032 fought G4170 (AorActInd) against G2596 the dragon G1404; and G2532 the dragon G1404 fought G4170 (AorActInd) and G2532 his G0846 angels G0032,
012:008 And G2532 prevailed G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756; neither G3777 was G2147 their G0846 place G5117 found G2147 (AorPasInd) any more G2089 in G1722 heaven G3772.
012:009 And G2532 the great G3173 dragon G1404 was cast out G0906 (AorPasInd), that old G0744 serpent G3789, called G2564 (PresPasPtc) the Devil G1228, and G2532 Satan G4567, which G3588 deceiveth G4105 (PresActPtc) the whole G3650 world G3625: he was cast out G0906 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the earth G1093, and G2532 his G0846 angels G0032 were cast out G0906 (AorPasInd) with G3326 him G0846.
012:010 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a loud G3173 voice G5456 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772, Now G0737 is come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) salvation G4991, and G2532 strength G1411, and G2532 the kingdom G0932 of our G2257 God G2316, and G2532 the power G1849 of his G0846 Christ G5547: for G3754 the accuser G2723 (PresActPtc) of our G2257 brethren G0080 is cast down G2598 (AorPasInd), which G3588 accused G2725 them G0846 before G1799 our G2257 God G2316 day G2250 and G2532 night G3571.
012:011 And G2532 they G0846 overcame G3528 (AorActInd) him G0846 by G1223 the blood G0129 of the Lamb G0721, and G2532 by G1223 the word G3056 of their G0846 testimony G3141; and G2532 they loved G0025 (AorActInd) not G3756 their G0846 lives G5590 unto G0891 the death G2288.
012:012 Therefore G1223 G5124 rejoice G2165 (PresPasImpr), [ye] heavens G3772, and G2532 ye that dwell G4637 (PresActPtc) in G1722 them G0846. Woe G3759 to the inhabiters G2730 (PresActPtc) of the earth G1093 and G2532 of the sea G2281! for G3754 the devil G1228 is come down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 you G5209, having G2192 (PresActPtc) great G3173 wrath G2372, because he knoweth G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 he hath G2192 (PresActInd) but a short G3641 time G2540.
012:013 And G2532 when G3753 the dragon G1404 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he was cast G0906 (AorPasInd) unto G1519 the earth G1093, he persecuted G1377 (AorActInd) the woman G1135 which G3748 brought forth G5088 (Aor2ActInd) the man G0730 [child].
012:014 And G2532 to the woman G1135 were given G1325 (AorPasInd) two G1417 wings G4420 of a great G3173 eagle G0105, that G2443 she might fly G4072 (PresMidPasDepSubj) into G1519 the wilderness G2048, into G1519 her G0846 place G5117, where G3699 she is nourished G5142 (PresPasInd) for a time G1563 G2540, and G2532 times G2540, and G2532 half G2255 a time G2540, from G0575 the face G4383 of the serpent G3789.
012:015 And G2532 the serpent G3789 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750 water G5204 as G5613 a flood G4215 after G3694 the woman G1135, that G2443 he might cause G4160 (AorActSubj) her G5026 to be carried away of the flood G4216.
012:016 And G2532 the earth G1093 helped G0997 (AorActInd) the woman G1135, and G2532 the earth G1093 opened G0455 (AorActInd) her G0846 mouth G4750, and G2532 swallowed up G2666 (Aor2ActInd) the flood G4215 which G3739 the dragon G1404 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750.
012:017 And G2532 the dragon G1404 was wroth G3710 (AorPasInd) with G1909 the woman G1135, and G2532 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to make G4160 (AorActInf) war G4171 with G3326 the remnant G3062 of her G0846 seed G4690, which G3588 keep G5083 (PresActPtc) the commandments G1785 of God G2316, and G2532 have G2192 (PresActPtc) the testimony G3141 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
013:001 ¶ And G2532 I stood G2476 (AorPasInd) upon G1909 the sand G0285 of the sea G2281, and G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a beast G2342 rise up G0305 (PresActPtc) out of G1537 the sea G2281, having G2192 (PresActPtc) seven G2033 heads G2776 and G2532 ten G1176 horns G2768, and G2532 upon G1909 his G0846 horns G2768 ten G1176 crowns G1238, and G2532 upon G1909 his G0846 heads G2776 the name G3686 of blasphemy G0988.
013:002 And G2532 the beast G2342 which G3739 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) was G2258 (ImpfInd) like G3664 unto a leopard G3917, and G2532 his G0846 feet G4228 were as G5613 [the feet] of a bear G0715, and G2532 his G0846 mouth G4750 as G5613 the mouth G4750 of a lion G3023: and G2532 the dragon G1404 gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 his G0846 power G1411, and G2532 his G0846 seat G2362, and G2532 great G3173 authority G1849.
013:003 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) one G3391 of his G0846 heads G2776 as it were G5613 wounded G4969 (PerfPasPtc) to G1519 death G2288; and G2532 his G0846 deadly G2288 wound G4127 was healed G2323 (AorPasInd): and G2532 all G3650 the world G1093 wondered G2296 (AorPasInd) G2296 (AorActInd) after G3694 G1722 the beast G2342.
013:004 And G2532 they worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) the dragon G1404 which G3739 gave G1325 (AorActInd) power G1849 unto the beast G2342: and G2532 they worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) the beast G2342, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 [is] like G3664 unto the beast G2342? who G5101 is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to make war G4170 (AorActInf) with G3326 him G0846?
013:005 And G2532 there was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 a mouth G4750 speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) great things G3173 and G2532 blasphemies G0988; and G2532 power G1849 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 to continue G4160 (AorActInf) forty G5062 [and] two G1417 months G3376.
013:006 And G2532 he opened G0455 (AorActInd) his G0846 mouth G4750 in G1519 blasphemy G0988 against G4314 God G2316, to blaspheme G0987 (AorActInf) his G0846 name G3686, and G2532 his G0846 tabernacle G4633, and G2532 them that dwell G4637 (PresActPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772.
013:007 And G2532 it was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 to make G4160 (AorActInf) war G4171 with G3326 the saints G0040, and G2532 to overcome G3528 (AorActInf) them G0846: and G2532 power G1849 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) him G0846 over G1909 all G3956 kindreds G5443, and G2532 tongues G1100, and G2532 nations G1484.
013:008 And G2532 all G3956 that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the earth G1093 shall worship G4352 (FutActInd) him G0846, whose G3739 names G3686 are G1125 not G3756 written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of life G2222 of the Lamb G0721 slain G4969 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889.
013:009 If any man G1536 have G2192 (PresActInd) an ear G3775, let him hear G0191 (AorActImpr).
013:010 He that G1536 leadeth G4863 (PresActInd) into captivity G0161 shall go G5217 (PresActInd) into G1519 captivity G0161: he that G1536 killeth G0615 (PresActInd) with G1722 the sword G3162 must G1163 (PresInd) be killed G0615 (AorPasInf) with G1722 the sword G3162. Here G5602 is G2076 (PresInd) the patience G5281 and G2532 the faith G4102 of the saints G0040.
013:011 And G2532 I beheld G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 beast G2342 coming up G0305 (PresActPtc) out of G1537 the earth G1093; and G2532 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd) two G1417 horns G2768 like G3664 a lamb G0721, and G2532 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) as G5613 a dragon G1404.
013:012 And G2532 he exerciseth G4160 (PresActInd) all G3956 the power G1849 of the first G4413 beast G2342 before G1799 him G0846, and G2532 causeth G4160 (PresActInd) the earth G1093 and G2532 them which dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) therein G1722 G0846 to G2443 worship G4352 (AorActSubj) the first G4413 beast G2342, whose G3739 G0846 deadly G2288 wound G4127 was healed G2323 (AorPasInd).
013:013 And G2532 he doeth G4160 (PresActInd) great G3173 wonders G4592, so G2532 that G2443 he maketh G4160 (PresActSubj) fire G4442 come down G2597 (PresActInf) from G1537 heaven G3772 on G1519 the earth G1093 in the sight G1799 of men G0444,
013:014 And G2532 deceiveth G4105 (PresActInd) them that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093 by G1223 [the means of] those miracles G4592 which G3739 he G0846 had power G1325 (AorPasInd) to do G4160 (AorActInf) in the sight G1799 of the beast G2342; saying G3004 (PresActPtc) to them that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093, that they should make G4160 (AorActInf) an image G1504 to the beast G2342, which G3739 had G2192 (PresActInd) the wound G4127 by a sword G3162, and G2532 did live G2198 (AorActInd).
013:015 And G2532 he G0846 had power G1325 (AorPasInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) life G4151 unto the image G1504 of the beast G2342, that G2443 the image G1504 of the beast G2342 should G2980 both G2532 speak G2980 (AorActSubj), and G2532 cause G4160 (AorActSubj) that as many as G3745 would G0302 G4352 not G3361 worship G4352 (AorActSubj) the image G1504 of the beast G2342 should be killed G2443 G0615 (AorPasSubj).
013:016 And G2532 he causeth G4160 (PresActInd) all G3956, both small G3398 and G2532 great G3173, G2532 rich G4145 and G2532 poor G4434, G2532 free G1658 and G2532 bond G1401, to G2443 G0846 receive G1325 (AorActSubj) a mark G5480 in G1909 their G0846 right hand G1188 G5495, or G2228 in G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359:
013:017 And G2532 that no G3363 man G5100 might G1410 (PresMidPasDepSubj) buy G0059 (AorActInf) or G2228 sell G4453 (AorActInf), save he G1508 that had G2192 (PresActPtc) the mark G5480, or G2228 the name G3686 of the beast G2342, or G2228 the number G0706 of his G0846 name G3686.
013:018 Here G5602 is G2076 (PresInd) wisdom G4678. Let him that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) understanding G3563 count G5585 (AorActImpr) the number G0706 of the beast G2342: for G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) the number G0706 of a man G0444; and G2532 his G0846 number G0706 [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six G5516.
014:001 ¶ And G2532 I looked G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a Lamb G0721 stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1909 the mount G3735 Sion G4622, and G2532 with G3326 him G0846 an hundred G1540 forty G5062 [and] four G5064 thousand G5505, having G2192 (PresActPtc) his G0846 Father’s G3962 name G3686 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359.
014:002 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772, as G5613 the voice G5456 of many G4183 waters G5204, and G2532 as G5613 the voice G5456 of a great G3173 thunder G1027: and G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the voice G5456 of harpers G2790 harping G2789 (PresActPtc) with G1722 their G0846 harps G2788:
014:003 And G2532 they sung G0103 (PresActInd) as it were G5613 a new G2537 song G5603 before G1799 the throne G2362, and G2532 before G1799 the four G5064 beasts G2226, and G2532 the elders G4245: and G2532 no man G3762 could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) learn G3129 (Aor2ActInf) that song G5603 but G1508 the hundred G1540 [and] forty G5062 [and] four G5064 thousand G5505, which G3588 were redeemed G0059 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 the earth G1093.
014:004 These G3778 are they G1526 (PresInd) which G3739 were G3435 not G3756 defiled G3435 (AorPasInd) with G3326 women G1135; for G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) virgins G3933. These G3778 are they G1526 (PresInd) which G3588 follow G0190 (PresActPtc) the Lamb G0721 whithersoever G3699 G0302 he goeth G5217 (PresActSubj). These G3778 were redeemed G0059 (AorPasInd) from G0575 among men G0444, [being] the firstfruits G0536 unto God G2316 and G2532 to the Lamb G0721.
014:005 And G2532 in G1722 their G0846 mouth G4750 was found G2147 (AorPasInd) no G3756 guile G1388: for G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) without fault G0299 before G1799 the throne G2362 of God G2316.
014:006 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 angel G0032 fly G4072 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the midst of heaven G3321, having G2192 (PresActPtc) the everlasting G0166 gospel G2098 to preach G2097 (AorActInf) unto them that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093, and G2532 to every G3956 nation G1484, and G2532 kindred G5443, and G2532 tongue G1100, and G2532 people G2992,
014:007 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc) with G1722 a loud G3173 voice G5456, Fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) God G2316, and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) glory G1391 to him G0846; for G3754 the hour G5610 of his G0846 judgment G2920 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd): and G2532 worship G4352 (AorActImpr) him that made G4160 (AorActPtc) heaven G3772, and G2532 earth G1093, and G2532 the sea G2281, and G2532 the fountains G4077 of waters G5204.
014:008 And G2532 there followed G0190 (AorActInd) another G0243 angel G0032, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Babylon G0897 is fallen G4098 (Aor2ActInd), is fallen G4098 (Aor2ActInd), that great G3173 city G4172, because G3754 she made G4222 all G3956 nations G1484 drink G4222 (PerfActInd) of G1537 the wine G3631 of the wrath G2372 of her G0846 fornication G4202.
014:009 And G2532 the third G5154 angel G0032 followed G0190 (AorActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) with G1722 a loud G3173 voice G5456, If any man G1536 worship G4352 (PresActInd) the beast G2342 and G2532 his G0846 image G1504, and G2532 receive G2983 (PresActInd) [his] mark G5480 in G1909 his G0846 forehead G3359, or G2228 in G1909 his G0846 hand G5495,
014:010 The same G0846 G2532 shall drink G4095 (FutMidDepInd) of G1537 the wine G3631 of the wrath G2372 of God G2316, which G3588 is poured out G2767 (PerfPasPtc) without mixture G0194 into G1722 the cup G4221 of his G0846 indignation G3709; and G2532 he shall be tormented G0928 (FutPasInd) with G1722 fire G4442 and G2532 brimstone G2303 in the presence G1799 of the holy G0040 angels G0032, and G2532 in the presence G1799 of the Lamb G0721:
014:011 And G2532 the smoke G2586 of their G0846 torment G0929 ascendeth up G0305 (PresActInd) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165: and G2532 they have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 rest G0372 day G2250 nor G2532 night G3571, who G3588 worship G4352 (PresActPtc) the beast G2342 and G2532 his G0846 image G1504, and G2532 whosoever G1536 receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) the mark G5480 of his G0846 name G3686.
014:012 Here G5602 is G2076 (PresInd) the patience G5281 of the saints G0040: here G5602 [are] they that keep G5083 (PresActPtc) the commandments G1785 of God G2316, and G2532 the faith G4102 of Jesus G2424.
014:013 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Write G1125 (AorActImpr), Blessed G3107 [are] the dead G3498 which G3588 die G0599 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the Lord G2962 from henceforth G0534: Yea G3483, saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Spirit G4151, that G2443 they may rest G0373 (AorMidSubj) from G1537 their G0846 labours G2873; and G1161 their G0846 works G2041 do follow G0190 (PresActInd) G3326 them G0846.
014:014 And G2532 I looked G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a white G3022 cloud G3507, and G2532 upon G1909 the cloud G3507 [one] sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) like G3664 unto the Son G5207 of man G0444, having G2192 (PresActPtc) on G1909 his G0846 head G2776 a golden G5552 crown G4735, and G2532 in G1722 his G0846 hand G5495 a sharp G3691 sickle G1407.
014:015 And G2532 another G0243 angel G0032 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the temple G3485, crying G2896 (PresActPtc) with G1722 a loud G3173 voice G5456 to him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the cloud G3507, Thrust in G3992 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 sickle G1407, and G2532 reap G2325 (AorActImpr): for G3754 the time G5610 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) for thee G4671 to reap G2325 (AorActInf); for G3754 the harvest G2326 of the earth G1093 is ripe G3583 (AorPasInd).
014:016 And G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the cloud G3507 thrust in G0906 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 sickle G1407 on G1909 the earth G1093; and G2532 the earth G1093 was reaped G2325 (AorPasInd).
014:017 And G2532 another G0243 angel G0032 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the temple G3485 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772, he G0846 also G2532 having G2192 (PresActPtc) a sharp G3691 sickle G1407.
014:018 And G2532 another G0243 angel G0032 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out G1537 from the altar G2379, which had G2192 (PresActPtc) power G1849 over G1909 fire G4442; and G2532 cried G5455 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 cry G2906 to him that had G2192 (PresActPtc) the sharp G3691 sickle G1407, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Thrust in G3992 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 sharp G3691 sickle G1407, and G2532 gather G5166 (AorActImpr) the clusters G1009 of the vine G0288 of the earth G1093; for G3754 her G0846 grapes G4718 are fully ripe G0187 (AorActInd).
014:019 And G2532 the angel G0032 thrust in G0906 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 sickle G1407 into G1519 the earth G1093, and G2532 gathered G5166 (AorActInd) the vine G0288 of the earth G1093, and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) [it] into G1519 the great G3173 winepress G3025 of the wrath G2372 of God G2316.
014:020 And G2532 the winepress G3025 was trodden G3961 (AorPasInd) without G1854 the city G4172, and G2532 blood G0129 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the winepress G3025, even unto G0891 the horse G2462 bridles G5469, by the space of G0575 a thousand G5507 [and] six hundred G1812 furlongs G4712.
015:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 sign G4592 in G1722 heaven G3772, great G3173 and G2532 marvellous G2298, seven G2033 angels G0032 having G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 last G2078 plagues G4127; for G3754 in G1722 them G0846 is filled up G5055 (AorPasInd) the wrath G2372 of God G2316.
015:002 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) as it were G5613 a sea G2281 of glass G5193 mingled G3396 (PerfPasPtc) with fire G4442: and G2532 them that had gotten the victory G3528 (PresActPtc) over G1537 the beast G2342, and G2532 over G1537 his G0846 image G1504, and G2532 over G1537 his G0846 mark G5480, [and] over G1537 the number G0706 of his G0846 name G3686, stand G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1909 the sea G2281 of glass G5193, having G2192 (PresActPtc) the harps G2788 of God G2316.
015:003 And G2532 they sing G0103 (PresActInd) the song G5603 of Moses G3475 the servant G1401 of God G2316, and G2532 the song G5603 of the Lamb G0721, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Great G3173 and G2532 marvellous G2298 [are] thy G4675 works G2041, Lord G2962 God G2316 Almighty G3841; just G1342 and G2532 true G0228 [are] thy G4675 ways G3598, thou King G0935 of saints G0040.
015:004 Who G5101 shall G5399 not G3364 fear G5399 (AorPasDepSubj) thee G4571, O Lord G2962, and G2532 glorify G1392 (AorActSubj) thy G4675 name G3686? for G3754 [thou] only G3441 [art] holy G3741: for G3754 all G3956 nations G1484 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) and G2532 worship G4352 (FutActInd) before G1799 thee G4675; for G3754 thy G4675 judgments G1345 are made manifest G5319 (AorPasInd).
015:005 And G2532 after G3326 that G5023 I looked G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the temple G3485 of the tabernacle G4633 of the testimony G3142 in G1722 heaven G3772 was opened G0455 (Aor2PasDepSubj):
015:006 And G2532 the seven G2033 angels G0032 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the temple G3485, having G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 plagues G4127, clothed G1746 (PerfMidPtc) in pure G2513 and G2532 white G2986 linen G3043, and G2532 having their breasts G4738 girded G4024 (PerfPasPtc) with G4012 golden G5552 girdles G2223.
015:007 And G2532 one G1520 of G1537 the four G5064 beasts G2226 gave G1325 (AorActInd) unto the seven G2033 angels G0032 seven G2033 golden G5552 vials G5357 full G1073 (PresActPtc) of the wrath G2372 of God G2316, who G3588 liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
015:008 And G2532 the temple G3485 was filled G1072 (AorPasInd) with smoke G2586 from G1537 the glory G1391 of God G2316, and G2532 from G1537 his G0846 power G1411; and G2532 no man G3762 was able G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the temple G3485, till G0891 the seven G2033 plagues G4127 of the seven G2033 angels G0032 were fulfilled G5055 (AorPasSubj).
016:001 ¶ And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a great G3173 voice G5456 out of G1537 the temple G3485 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) to the seven G2033 angels G0032, Go your ways G5217 (PresActImpr), and G2532 pour out G1632 (AorActImpr) the vials G5357 of the wrath G2372 of God G2316 upon G1519 the earth G1093.
016:002 And G2532 the first G4413 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1909 the earth G1093; and G2532 there fell G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a noisome G2556 and G2532 grievous G4190 sore G1668 upon G1519 the men G0444 which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) the mark G5480 of the beast G2342, and G2532 [upon] them which worshipped G4352 (PresActPtc) his G0846 image G1504.
016:003 And G2532 the second G1208 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1519 the sea G2281; and G2532 it became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5613 the blood G0129 of a dead G3498 [man]: and G2532 every G3956 living G2198 (PresActPtc) soul G5590 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the sea G2281.
016:004 And G2532 the third G5154 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1519 the rivers G4215 and G2532 G1519 fountains G4077 of waters G5204; and G2532 they became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) blood G0129.
016:005 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) the angel G0032 of the waters G5204 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Thou art G1488 (PresInd) righteous G1342, O Lord G2962, which G3588 art G5607 (PresPtc) G3801, and G2532 wast G2258 (ImpfInd) G3801, and G2532 shalt be G3741 (FutPtc) G3801, because G3754 thou hast judged G2919 (AorActInd) thus G5023.
016:006 For G3754 they have shed G1632 (AorActInd) the blood G0129 of saints G0040 and G2532 prophets G4396, and G2532 thou hast given G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 blood G0129 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf); for G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) worthy G0514.
016:007 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) another G0243 out of G1537 the altar G2379 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Even so G3483, Lord G2962 God G2316 Almighty G3841, true G0228 and G2532 righteous G1342 [are] thy G4675 judgments G2920.
016:008 And G2532 the fourth G5067 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1909 the sun G2246; and G2532 power was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 to scorch G2739 (AorActInf) men G0444 with G1722 fire G4442.
016:009 And G2532 men G0444 were scorched G2739 (AorPasInd) with great G3173 heat G2738, and G2532 blasphemed G0987 (AorActInd) the name G3686 of God G2316, which G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) power G1849 over G1909 these G5025 plagues G4127: and G2532 they repented G3340 (AorActInd) not G3756 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 glory G1391.
016:010 And G2532 the fifth G3991 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1909 the seat G2362 of the beast G2342; and G2532 his G0846 kingdom G0932 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) full of darkness G4656 (PerfPasPtc); and G2532 they gnawed G3145 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) their G0846 tongues G1100 for G1537 pain G4192,
016:011 And G2532 blasphemed G0987 (AorActInd) the God G2316 of heaven G3772 because of G1537 their G0846 pains G4192 and G2532 G1537 their G0846 sores G1668, and G2532 repented G3340 (AorActInd) not G3756 of G1537 their G0846 deeds G2041.
016:012 And G2532 the sixth G1623 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 upon G1909 the great G3173 river G4215 Euphrates G2166; and G2532 the water G5204 thereof G0846 was dried up G3583 (AorPasInd), that G2443 the way G3598 of the kings G0935 of G0575 the east G0395 G2246 might be prepared G2090 (AorPasSubj).
016:013 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) three G5140 unclean G0169 spirits G4151 like G3664 frogs G0944 [come] out of G1537 the mouth G4750 of the dragon G1404, and G2532 out of G1537 the mouth G4750 of the beast G2342, and G2532 out of G1537 the mouth G4750 of the false prophet G5578.
016:014 For G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) the spirits G4151 of devils G1142, working G4160 (PresActPtc) miracles G4592, [which] go forth G1607 (PresMidPasDepInf) G3739 G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G1909 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093 and G2532 of the whole G3650 world G3625, to gather G4863 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846 to G1519 the battle G4171 of that G1565 great G3173 day G2250 of God G2316 Almighty G3841.
016:015 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) as G5613 a thief G2812. Blessed G3107 [is] he that watcheth G1127 (PresActPtc), and G2532 keepeth G5083 (PresActPtc) his G0846 garments G2440, lest G3363 he walk G4043 (PresActSubj) naked G1131, and G2532 they see G0991 (PresActSubj) his G0846 shame G0808.
016:016 And G2532 he gathered G4863 them G0846 together G4863 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a place G5117 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) in the Hebrew tongue G1447 Armageddon G0717.
016:017 And G2532 the seventh G1442 angel G0032 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) his G0846 vial G5357 into G1519 the air G0109; and G2532 there came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) a great G3173 voice G5456 out of G0575 the temple G3485 of heaven G3772, from G0575 the throne G2362, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), It is done G1096 (Perf2ActInd).
016:018 And G2532 there were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) voices G5456, and G2532 thunders G1027, and G2532 lightnings G0796; and G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 earthquake G4578, such as G3634 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) not G3756 since G3739 G0575 men G0444 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) upon G1909 the earth G1093, so mighty G5082 an earthquake G4578, [and] so G3779 great G3173.
016:019 And G2532 the great G3173 city G4172 was divided G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) into G1519 three G5140 parts G3313, and G2532 the cities G4172 of the nations G1484 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd): and G2532 great G3173 Babylon G0897 came in remembrance G3415 (AorPasInd) before G1799 God G2316, to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) unto her G0846 the cup G4221 of the wine G3631 of the fierceness G2372 of his G0846 wrath G3709.
016:020 And G2532 every G3956 island G3520 fled away G5343 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the mountains G3735 were G2147 not G3756 found G2147 (AorPasInd).
016:021 And G2532 there fell G2597 (PresActInd) upon G1909 men G0444 a great G3173 hail G5464 out of G1537 heaven G3772, [every stone] about G5613 the weight of a talent G5006: and G2532 men G0444 blasphemed G0987 (AorActInd) God G2316 because of G1537 the plague G4127 of the hail G5464; for G3754 the plague G4127 thereof G0846 was G2076 (PresInd) exceeding G4970 great G3173.
017:001 ¶ And G2532 there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) one G1520 of G1537 the seven G2033 angels G0032 which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 vials G5357, and G2532 talked G2980 (AorActInd) with G3326 me G1700, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Come hither G1204 (Impr); I will shew G1166 (FutActInd) unto thee G4671 the judgment G2917 of the great G3173 whore G4204 that sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 many G4183 waters G5204:
017:002 With G3326 whom G3739 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093 have committed fornication G4203 (AorActInd), and G2532 the inhabitants G2730 (PresActPtc) of the earth G1093 have been made drunk G3184 (AorPasInd) with G1537 the wine G3631 of her G0846 fornication G4202.
017:003 So G2532 he carried G0667 me G3165 away G0667 (AorActInd) in G1722 the spirit G4151 into G1519 the wilderness G2048: and G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a woman G1135 sit G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 a scarlet coloured G2847 beast G2342, full of G1073 (PresActPtc) names G3686 of blasphemy G0988, having G2192 (PresActPtc) seven G2033 heads G2776 and G2532 ten G1176 horns G2768.
017:004 And G2532 the woman G1135 was G2258 (ImpfInd) arrayed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) in purple G4209 and G2532 scarlet colour G2847, and G2532 decked G5558 (PerfPasPtc) with gold G5557 and G2532 precious G5093 stones G3037 and G2532 pearls G3135, having G2192 (PresActPtc) a golden G5552 cup G4221 in G1722 her G0846 hand G5495 full of G1073 (PresActPtc) abominations G0946 and G2532 filthiness G0168 of her G0846 fornication G4202:
017:005 And G2532 upon G1909 her G0846 forehead G3359 [was] a name G3686 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), MYSTERY G3466, BABYLON G0897 THE GREAT G3173, THE MOTHER G3384 OF HARLOTS G4204 AND G2532 ABOMINATIONS G0946 OF THE EARTH G1093.
017:006 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the woman G1135 drunken G3184 (PresActPtc) with G1537 the blood G0129 of the saints G0040, and G2532 with G1537 the blood G0129 of the martyrs G3144 of Jesus G2424: and G2532 when I saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) her G0846, I wondered G2296 (AorActInd) with great G3173 admiration G2295.
017:007 And G2532 the angel G0032 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, Wherefore G1302 didst thou marvel G2296 (AorActInd)? I G1473 will tell G2046 (FutActInd) thee G4671 the mystery G3466 of the woman G1135, and G2532 of the beast G2342 that carrieth G0941 (PresActPtc) her G0846, which G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 heads G2776 and G2532 ten G1176 horns G2768.
017:008 The beast G2342 that G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) was G2258 (ImpfInd), and G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756; and G2532 shall G3195 (PresActInd) ascend G0305 (PresActInf) out of G1537 the bottomless pit G0012, and G2532 go G5217 (PresActInf) into G1519 perdition G0684: and G2532 they that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the earth G1093 shall wonder G2296 (FutMidDepInd), whose G3739 names G3686 were G1125 not G3756 written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1909 the book G0975 of life G2222 from G0575 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889, when they behold G0991 (PresActPtc) the beast G2342 that was G3748 G2258 (ImpfInd), and G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756, and yet G2539 is G2076 (PresInd).
017:009 And here G5602 [is] the mind G3563 which G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) wisdom G4678. The seven G2033 heads G2776 are G1526 (PresInd) seven G2033 mountains G3735, on G1909 which G0846 the woman G1135 sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepInd) G3699.
017:010 And G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) seven G2033 kings G0935: five G4002 are fallen G4098 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 one G1520 is G2076 (PresInd), [and] the other G0243 is G2064 not yet G3768 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 when G3752 he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) continue G3306 (AorActInf) a short space G3641.
017:011 And G2532 the beast G2342 that G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd), and G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756, even G2532 he G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) the eighth G3590, and G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 the seven G2033, and G2532 goeth G5217 (PresActInd) into G1519 perdition G0684.
017:012 And G2532 the ten G1176 horns G2768 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) are G1526 (PresInd) ten G1176 kings G0935, which G3748 have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) no G3768 kingdom G0932 as yet G3768; but G0235 receive G2983 (PresActInd) power G1849 as G5613 kings G0935 one G3391 hour G5610 with G3326 the beast G2342.
017:013 These G3778 have G2192 (PresActInd) one G3391 mind G1106, and G2532 shall give G1239 (PresActInd) their G1438 power G1411 and G2532 strength G1849 unto the beast G2342.
017:014 These G3778 shall make war G4170 (FutActInd) with G3326 the Lamb G0721, and G2532 the Lamb G0721 shall overcome G3528 (FutActInd) them G0846: for G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) Lord G2962 of lords G2962, and G2532 King G0935 of kings G0935: and G2532 they that are with G3326 him G0846 [are] called G2822, and G2532 chosen G1588, and G2532 faithful G4103.
017:015 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, The waters G5204 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd), where G3757 the whore G4204 sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepInd), are G1526 (PresInd) peoples G2992, and G2532 multitudes G3793, and G2532 nations G1484, and G2532 tongues G1100.
017:016 And G2532 the ten G1176 horns G2768 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 the beast G2342, these G3778 shall hate G3404 (FutActInd) the whore G4204, and G2532 shall make G4160 (FutActInd) her G0846 desolate G2049 (PerfPasPtc) and G2532 naked G1131, and G2532 shall eat G5315 (Fut2MidDepInd) her G0846 flesh G4561, and G2532 burn G2618 (FutActInd) her G0846 with G1722 fire G4442.
017:017 For G1063 God G2316 hath put G1325 (AorActInd) in G1519 their G0846 hearts G2588 to fulfil G4160 (AorActInf) his G0846 will G1106, and G2532 to agree G4160 (AorActInf) G3391 G1106, and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) their G0846 kingdom G0932 unto the beast G2342, until G0891 the words G4487 of God G2316 shall be fulfilled G5055 (AorPasSubj).
017:018 And G2532 the woman G1135 which G3739 thou sawest G1492 (Aor2ActInd) is G2076 (PresInd) that great G3173 city G4172, which G3588 reigneth G2192 (PresActPtc) G0932 over G1909 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093.
018:001 ¶ And G2532 after G3326 these things G5023 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) another G0243 angel G0032 come down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, having G2192 (PresActPtc) great G3173 power G1849; and G2532 the earth G1093 was lightened G5461 (AorPasInd) with G1537 his G0846 glory G1391.
018:002 And G2532 he cried G2896 (AorActInd) mightily G2479 with G1722 a strong G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Babylon G0897 the great G3173 is fallen G4098 (Aor2ActInd), is fallen G4098 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 is become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) the habitation G2732 of devils G1142, and G2532 the hold G5438 of every G3956 foul G0169 spirit G4151, and G2532 a cage G5438 of every G3956 unclean G0169 and G2532 hateful G3404 (PerfPasPtc) bird G3732.
018:003 For G3754 all G3956 nations G1484 have drunk G4095 (PerfActInd) of G1537 the wine G3631 of the wrath G2372 of her G0846 fornication G4202, and G2532 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093 have committed fornication G4203 (AorActInd) with G3326 her G0846, and G2532 the merchants G1713 of the earth G1093 are waxed rich G4147 (AorActInd) through G1537 the abundance G1411 of her G0846 delicacies G4764.
018:004 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) another G0243 voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Come G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 her G0846, my G3450 people G2992, that G3363 ye be G4790 not G3363 partakers G4790 (AorActSubj) of her G0846 sins G0266, and G2532 that G3363 ye receive G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3363 of G1537 her G0846 plagues G4127.
018:005 For G3754 her G0846 sins G0266 have reached G0190 (AorActInd) G2853 (AorPasInd) unto G0891 heaven G3772, and G2532 God G2316 hath remembered G3421 (AorActInd) her G0846 iniquities G0092.
018:006 Reward G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) her G0846 even G2532 as G5613 she G0846 G3778 rewarded G0591 (AorActInd) you G5213, and G2532 double G1363 (AorActImpr) unto her G0846 double G1362 according to G2596 her G0846 works G2041: in G1722 the cup G4221 which G3739 she hath filled G2767 (AorActInd) fill G2767 (AorActImpr) to her G0846 double G1362.
018:007 How much G3745 she hath glorified G1392 (AorActInd) herself G1438, and G2532 lived deliciously G4763 (AorActInd), so much G5118 torment G0929 and G2532 sorrow G3997 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) her G0846: for G3754 she saith G3004 (PresActInd) in G1722 her G0846 heart G2588, I sit G2521 (PresMidPasDepInd) a queen G0938, and G2532 am G1510 (PresInd) no G3756 widow G5503, and G2532 shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) no G3364 sorrow G3997.
018:008 Therefore G5124 G1223 shall G2240 her G0846 plagues G4127 come G2240 (FutActInd) in G1722 one G3391 day G2250, death G2288, and G2532 mourning G3997, and G2532 famine G3042; and G2532 she shall be utterly burned G2618 (FutPasInd) with G1722 fire G4442: for G3754 strong G2478 [is] the Lord G2962 God G2316 who G3588 judgeth G2919 (PresActPtc) her G0846.
018:009 And G2532 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093, who G3588 have committed fornication G4203 (AorActPtc) and G2532 lived deliciously G4763 (AorActPtc) with G3326 her G0846, shall bewail G2799 (FutMidDepInd) her G0846, and G2532 lament G2875 (FutMidDepInd) for G1909 her G0846, when G3752 they shall see G0991 (PresActSubj) the smoke G2586 of her G0846 burning G4451,
018:010 Standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) afar G3113 off G0575 for G1223 the fear G5401 of her G0846 torment G0929, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Alas G3759, alas G3759, that great G3173 city G4172 Babylon G0897, that mighty G2478 city G4172! for G3754 in G1722 one G3391 hour G5610 is G2064 thy G4675 judgment G2920 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd).
018:011 And G2532 the merchants G1713 of the earth G1093 shall weep G2799 (PresActInd) and G2532 mourn G3996 (PresActInd) over G1909 her G0846; for G3754 no man G3762 buyeth G0059 (PresActInd) their G0846 merchandise G1117 any more G3765:
018:012 The merchandise G1117 of gold G5557, and G2532 silver G0696, and G2532 precious G5093 stones G3037, and G2532 of pearls G3135, and G2532 fine linen G1040, and G2532 purple G4209, and G2532 silk G4596, and G2532 scarlet G2847, and G2532 all G3956 thyine G2367 wood G3586, and G2532 all manner G3956 vessels G4632 of ivory G1661, and G2532 all manner G3956 vessels G4632 of G1537 most precious G5093 wood G3586, and G2532 of brass G5475, and G2532 iron G4604, and G2532 marble G3139,
018:013 And G2532 cinnamon G2792, and G2532 odours G2368, and G2532 ointments G3464, and G2532 frankincense G3030, and G2532 wine G3631, and G2532 oil G1637, and G2532 fine flour G4585, and G2532 wheat G4621, and G2532 beasts G2934, and G2532 sheep G4263, and G2532 horses G2462, and G2532 chariots G4480, and G2532 slaves G4983, and G2532 souls G5590 of men G0444.
018:014 And G2532 the fruits G3703 that thy G4675 soul G5590 lusted after G1939 are departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 thee G4675, and G2532 all things G3956 which G3588 were dainty G3045 and G2532 goodly G2986 are departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 thee G4675, and G2532 thou shalt find G2147 (AorActSubj) them G0846 no more G3765 at all G3364.
018:015 The merchants G1713 of these things G5130, which G3588 were made rich G4147 (AorActPtc) by G0575 her G0846, shall stand G2476 (FutMidDepInd) afar G3113 off G0575 for G1223 the fear G5401 of her G0846 torment G0929, weeping G2799 (PresActPtc) and G2532 wailing G3996 (PresActPtc),
018:016 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Alas G3759, alas G3759, that great G3173 city G4172, that was clothed in G4016 (PerfPasPtc) fine linen G1039, and G2532 purple G4210, and G2532 scarlet G2847, and G2532 decked G5558 (PerfPasPtc) with G1722 gold G5557, and G2532 precious G5093 stones G3037, and G2532 pearls G3135!
018:017 For G3754 in one G3391 hour G5610 so great G5118 riches G4149 is come to nought G2049 (AorPasInd). And G2532 every G3956 shipmaster G2942, and G2532 all G3956 the company G3658 in G1909 ships G4143, and G2532 sailors G3492, and G2532 as many as G3745 trade G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by sea G2281, stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) afar G3113 off G0575,
018:018 And G2532 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) when they saw G3708 (PresActPtc) the smoke G2586 of her G0846 burning G4451, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 [city is] like G3664 unto this great G3173 city G4172!
018:019 And G2532 they cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) dust G5522 on G1909 their G0846 heads G2776, and G2532 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), weeping G2799 (PresActPtc) and G2532 wailing G3996 (PresActPtc), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Alas G3759, alas G3759, that great G3173 city G4172, wherein G1722 G3739 were made rich G4147 (AorActInd) all G3956 that had G2192 (PresActPtc) ships G4143 in G1722 the sea G2281 by reason of G1537 her G0846 costliness G5094! for G3754 in one G3391 hour G5610 is she made desolate G2049 (AorPasInd).
018:020 Rejoice G2165 (PresPasImpr) over G1909 her G0846, [thou] heaven G3772, and G2532 [ye] holy G0040 apostles G0652 and G2532 prophets G4396; for G3754 God G2316 hath avenged G2917 G2919 (AorActInd) you G5216 on G1537 her G0846.
018:021 And G2532 a G1520 mighty G2478 angel G0032 took up G0142 (AorActInd) a stone G3037 like G5613 a great G3173 millstone G3458, and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) [it] into G1519 the sea G2281, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Thus G3779 with violence G3731 shall G0906 that great G3173 city G4172 Babylon G0897 be thrown down G0906 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall be found G2147 (AorPasSubj) no more G3364 at all G2089.
018:022 And G2532 the voice G5456 of harpers G2790, and G2532 musicians G3451, and G2532 of pipers G0834, and G2532 trumpeters G4538, shall be heard G0191 (AorPasSubj) no more G3364 at all G2089 in G1722 thee G4671; and G2532 no G3364 G3956 craftsman G5079, of whatsoever G3956 craft G5078 [he be], shall be found G2147 (AorPasSubj) any more G2089 in G1722 thee G4671; and G2532 the sound G5456 of a millstone G3458 shall be heard G0191 (AorPasSubj) no more G3364 at all G2089 in G1722 thee G4671;
018:023 And G2532 the light G5457 of a candle G3088 shall shine G5316 (Aor2PasSubj) no more G3364 at all G2089 in G1722 thee G4671; and G2532 the voice G5456 of the bridegroom G3566 and G2532 of the bride G3565 shall be heard G0191 (AorPasSubj) no more G3364 at all G2089 in G1722 thee G4671: for G3754 thy G4675 merchants G1713 were G2258 (ImpfInd) the great men G3175 of the earth G1093; for G3754 by G1722 thy G4675 sorceries G5331 were G4105 all G3956 nations G1484 deceived G4105 (AorPasInd).
018:024 And G2532 in G1722 her G0846 was found G2147 (AorPasInd) the blood G0129 of prophets G4396, and G2532 of saints G0040, and G2532 of all G3956 that were slain G4969 (PerfPasPtc) upon G1909 the earth G1093.
019:001 ¶ And G2532 after G3326 these things G5023 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a great G3173 voice G5456 of much G4183 people G3793 in G1722 heaven G3772, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Alleluia G0239; Salvation G4991, and G2532 glory G1391, and G2532 honour G5092, and G2532 power G1411, unto the Lord G2962 our G2257 God G2316:
019:002 For G3754 true G0228 and G2532 righteous G1342 [are] his G0846 judgments G2920: for G3754 he hath judged G2919 (AorActInd) the great G3173 whore G4204, which G3748 did corrupt G5351 (ImpfActInd) the earth G1093 with G1722 her G0846 fornication G4202, and G2532 hath avenged G1556 (AorActInd) the blood G0129 of his G0846 servants G1401 at G1537 her G0846 hand G5495.
019:003 And G2532 again G1208 they said G2046 (PerfActInd), Alleluia G0239. And G2532 her G0846 smoke G2586 rose up G0305 (PresActInd) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
019:004 And G2532 the four G5064 and G2532 twenty G1501 elders G4245 and G2532 the four G5064 beasts G2226 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) God G2316 that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the throne G2362, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Amen G0281; Alleluia G0239.
019:005 And G2532 a voice G5456 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the throne G2362, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Praise G0134 (PresActImpr) our G2257 God G2316, all ye G3956 his G0846 servants G1401, and G2532 ye that fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) him G0846, both G2532 small G3398 and G2532 great G3173.
019:006 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) as it were G5613 the voice G5456 of a great G4183 multitude G3793, and G2532 as G5613 the voice G5456 of many G4183 waters G5204, and G2532 as G5613 the voice G5456 of mighty G2478 thunderings G1027, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Alleluia G0239: for G3754 the Lord G2962 God G2316 omnipotent G3841 reigneth G0936 (AorActInd).
019:007 Let us be glad G5463 (PresActSubj) and G2532 rejoice G0021 (PresMidPasDepSubj), and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) honour G1391 to him G0846: for G3754 the marriage G1062 of the Lamb G0721 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 his G0846 wife G1135 hath made G2090 herself G1438 ready G2090 (AorActInd).
019:008 And G2532 to her G0846 was granted G1325 (AorPasInd) that G2443 she should be arrayed G4016 (Aor2MidSubj) in fine linen G1039, clean G2513 and G2532 white G2986: for G1063 the fine linen G1039 is G2076 (PresInd) the righteousness G1345 of saints G0040.
019:009 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Write G1125 (AorActImpr), Blessed G3107 [are] they which are called G2564 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1519 the marriage G1062 supper G1173 of the Lamb G0721. And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, These G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) the true G0228 sayings G3056 of God G2316.
019:010 And G2532 I fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) at G1715 his G0846 feet G4228 to worship G4352 (AorActInf) him G0846. And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, See G3708 (PresActImpr) [thou do it] not G3361: I am G1510 (PresInd) thy G4675 fellowservant G4889, and G2532 of thy G4675 brethren G0080 that have G2192 (PresActPtc) the testimony G3141 of Jesus G2424: worship G4352 (AorActImpr) God G2316: for G1063 the testimony G3141 of Jesus G2424 is G2076 (PresInd) the spirit G4151 of prophecy G4394.
019:011 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) heaven G3772 opened G0455 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a white G3022 horse G2462; and G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 him G0846 [was] called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Faithful G4103 and G2532 True G0228, and G2532 in G1722 righteousness G1343 he doth judge G2919 (PresActInd) and G2532 make war G4170 (PresActInd).
019:012  G1161 His G0846 eyes G3788 [were] as G5613 a flame G5395 of fire G4442, and G2532 on G1909 his G0846 head G2776 [were] many G4183 crowns G1238; and he had G2192 (PresActPtc) a name G3686 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), that G3739 no man G3762 knew G1492 (PerfActInd), but G1508 he himself G0846.
019:013 And G2532 he [was] clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) with a vesture G2440 dipped G0911 (PerfPasPtc) in blood G0129: and G2532 his G0846 name G3686 is called G2564 (PresPasInd) The Word G3056 of God G2316.
019:014 And G2532 the armies G4753 [which were G3588 ] in G1722 heaven G3772 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 upon G1909 white G3022 horses G2462, clothed G1746 (PerfMidPtc) in fine linen G1039, white G3022 and G2532 clean G2513.
019:015 And G2532 out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750 goeth G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) a sharp G3691 sword G4501, that G2443 with G1722 it G0846 he should smite G3960 (AorActSubj) the nations G1484: and G2532 he G0846 shall rule G4165 (FutActInd) them G0846 with G1722 a rod G4464 of iron G4603: and G2532 he G0846 treadeth G3961 (PresActInd) the winepress G3025 G3631 of the fierceness G2372 and G2532 wrath G3709 of Almighty G3841 God G2316.
019:016 And G2532 he hath G2192 (PresActInd) on G1909 [his] vesture G2440 and G2532 on G1909 his G0846 thigh G3382 a name G3686 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), KING G0935 OF KINGS G0935, AND G2532 LORD G2962 OF LORDS G2962.
019:017 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) an G1520 angel G0032 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the sun G2246; and G2532 he cried G2896 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) to all G3956 the fowls G3732 that fly G4072 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the midst of heaven G3321, Come G1205 (Impr) and G2532 gather yourselves together G4863 (PresPasImpr) unto G1519 the supper G1173 of the great G3173 God G2316;
019:018 That G2443 ye may eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the flesh G4561 of kings G0935, and G2532 the flesh G4561 of captains G5506, and G2532 the flesh G4561 of mighty men G2478, and G2532 the flesh G4561 of horses G2462, and G2532 of them that sit G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 them G0846, and G2532 the flesh G4561 of all G3956 [men, both] free G1658 and G2532 bond G1401, both G2532 small G3398 and G2532 great G3173.
019:019 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the beast G2342, and G2532 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093, and G2532 their G0846 armies G4753, gathered together G4863 (PerfPasPtc) to make G4160 (AorActInf) war G4171 against G3326 him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the horse G2462, and G2532 against G3326 his G0846 army G4753.
019:020 And G2532 the beast G2342 was taken G4084 (AorPasInd), and G2532 with G3326 him G5127 the false prophet G5578 that wrought G4160 (AorActPtc) miracles G4592 before G1799 him G0846, with G1722 which G3739 he deceived G4105 (AorActInd) them that had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the mark G5480 of the beast G2342, and G2532 them that worshipped G4352 (PresActPtc) his G0846 image G1504. These both G1417 were cast G0906 (AorPasInd) alive G2198 (PresActPtc) into G1519 a lake G3041 of fire G4442 burning G2545 (PresPasPtc) with G1722 brimstone G2303.
019:021 And G2532 the remnant G3062 were slain G0615 (AorPasInd) with G1722 the sword G4501 of him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the horse G2462, which G3588 [sword] proceeded G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750: and G2532 all G3956 the fowls G3732 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd) with G1537 their G0846 flesh G4561.
020:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) an angel G0032 come down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, having G2192 (PresActPtc) the key G2807 of the bottomless pit G0012 and G2532 a great G3173 chain G0254 in G1909 his G0846 hand G5495.
020:002 And G2532 he laid hold on G2902 (AorActInd) the dragon G1404, that old G0744 serpent G3789, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) the Devil G1228, and G2532 Satan G4567, and G2532 bound G1210 (AorActInd) him G0846 a thousand G5507 years G2094,
020:003 And G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 into G1519 the bottomless pit G0012, and G2532 shut G2808 him G0846 up G2808 (AorActInd), and G2532 set a seal G4972 (AorActInd) upon G1883 him G0846, that G3363 he should deceive G4105 (AorActSubj) the nations G1484 no G3363 more G2089, till G0891 the thousand G5507 years G2094 should be fulfilled G5055 (AorPasSubj): and G2532 after G3326 that G5023 he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) be loosed G3089 (AorPasInf) a little G3398 season G5550.
020:004 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thrones G2362, and G2532 they sat G2523 (AorActInd) upon G1909 them G0846, and G2532 judgment G2917 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846: and G2532 [I saw] the souls G5590 of them that were beheaded G3990 (PerfPasPtc) for G1223 the witness G3141 of Jesus G2424, and G2532 for G1223 the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 which G3748 had G4352 not G3756 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) the beast G2342, neither G3777 his G0846 image G1504, G2532 neither G3756 had received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) [his] mark G5480 upon G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359, or G2532 in G1909 their G0846 hands G5495; and G2532 they lived G2198 (AorActInd) and G2532 reigned G0936 (AorActInd) with G3326 Christ G5547 a thousand G5507 years G2094.
020:005 But G1161 the rest G3062 of the dead G3498 lived G0326 not G3756 again G0326 (AorActInd) until G2193 the thousand G5507 years G2094 were finished G5055 (AorPasSubj). This G3778 [is] the first G4413 resurrection G0386.
020:006 Blessed G3107 and G2532 holy G0040 [is] he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) part G3313 in G1722 the first G4413 resurrection G0386: on G1909 such G5130 the second G1208 death G2288 hath G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 power G1849, but G0235 they shall be G2071 (FutInd) priests G2409 of God G2316 and G2532 of Christ G5547, and G2532 shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) with G3326 him G0846 a thousand G5507 years G2094.
020:007 And G2532 when G3752 the thousand G5507 years G2094 are expired G5055 (AorPasSubj), Satan G4567 shall be loosed G3089 (FutPasInd) out of G1537 his G0846 prison G5438,
020:008 And G2532 shall go out G1831 (FutMidDepInd) to deceive G4105 (AorActInf) the nations G1484 which G3588 are in G1722 the four G5064 quarters G1137 of the earth G1093, Gog G1136 and G2532 Magog G3098, to gather G4863 them G0846 together G4863 (Aor2ActInf) to G1519 battle G4171: the number G0706 of whom G3739 [is] as G5613 the sand G0285 of the sea G2281.
020:009 And G2532 they went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 the breadth G4114 of the earth G1093, and G2532 compassed G2944 the camp G3925 of the saints G0040 about G2944 (AorActInd), and G2532 the beloved G0025 (PerfPasPtc) city G4172: and G2532 fire G4442 came down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 God G2316 out of G1537 heaven G3772, and G2532 devoured G2719 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846.
020:010 And G2532 the devil G1228 that deceived G4105 (PresActPtc) them G0846 was cast G0906 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the lake G3041 of fire G4442 and G2532 brimstone G2303, where G3699 the beast G2342 and G2532 the false prophet G5578 [are], and G2532 shall be tormented G0928 (FutPasInd) day G2250 and G2532 night G3571 for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
020:011 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a great G3173 white G3022 throne G2362, and G2532 him that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 it G0846, from G0575 whose G3739 face G4383 the earth G1093 and G2532 the heaven G3772 fled away G5343 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 there was found G2147 (AorPasInd) no G3756 place G5117 for them G0846.
020:012 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the dead G3498, small G3398 and G2532 great G3173, stand G2476 (PerfActPtc) before G1799 God G2316; and G2532 the books G0975 were opened G0455 (AorPasInd): and G2532 another G0243 book G0975 was opened G0455 (AorPasInd), which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) [the book] of life G2222: and G2532 the dead G3498 were judged G2919 (AorPasInd) out of G1537 those things which were written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the books G0975, according to G2596 their G0846 works G2041.
020:013 And G2532 the sea G2281 gave up G1325 (AorActInd) the dead G3498 which G3588 were in G1722 it G0846; and G2532 death G2288 and G2532 hell G0086 delivered up G1325 (AorActInd) the dead G3498 which G3588 were in G1722 them G0846: and G2532 they were judged G2919 (AorPasInd) every man G1538 according to G2596 their G0846 works G2041.
020:014 And G2532 death G2288 and G2532 hell G0086 were cast G0906 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the lake G3041 of fire G4442. This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the second G1208 death G2288.
020:015 And G2532 whosoever G1536 was G2147 not G3756 found G2147 (AorPasInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the book G0976 of life G2222 was cast G0906 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the lake G3041 of fire G4442.
021:001 ¶ And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a new G2537 heaven G3772 and G2532 a new G2537 earth G1093: for G1063 the first G4413 heaven G3772 and G2532 the first G4413 earth G1093 were passed away G3928 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 there was G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 more G2089 sea G2281.
021:002 And G2532 I G1473 John G2491 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the holy G0040 city G4172, new G2537 Jerusalem G2419, coming down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G0575 God G2316 out of G1537 heaven G3772, prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) as G5613 a bride G3565 adorned G2885 (PerfPasPtc) for her G0846 husband G0435.
021:003 And G2532 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a great G3173 voice G5456 out of G1537 heaven G3772 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the tabernacle G4633 of God G2316 [is] with G3326 men G0444, and G2532 he will dwell G4637 (FutActInd) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 they G0846 shall be G2071 (FutInd) his G0846 people G2992, and G2532 God G2316 himself G0846 shall be G2071 (FutInd) with G3326 them G0846, [and be] their G0846 God G2316.
021:004 And G2532 God G2316 shall wipe away G1813 (FutActInd) all G3956 tears G1144 from G0575 their G0846 eyes G3788; and G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3756 more G2089 death G2288, neither G3777 sorrow G3997, nor G3777 crying G2906, neither G3777 G3756 shall there be G2071 (FutInd) any more G2089 pain G4192: for G3754 the former things G4413 are passed away G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
021:005 And G2532 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the throne G2362 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I make G4160 (PresActInd) all things G3956 new G2537. And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Write G1125 (AorActImpr): for G3754 these G3778 words G3056 are G1526 (PresInd) true G0228 and G2532 faithful G4103.
021:006 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, It is done G1096 (Perf2ActInd). I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Alpha G0001 and G2532 Omega G5598, the beginning G0746 and G2532 the end G5056. I G1473 will give G1325 (FutActInd) unto him that is athirst G1372 (PresActPtc) of G1537 the fountain G4077 of the water G5204 of life G2222 freely G1432.
021:007 He that overcometh G3528 (PresActPtc) shall inherit G2816 (FutActInd) all things G3956; and G2532 I will be G2071 (FutInd) his G0846 God G2316, and G2532 he G0846 shall be G2071 (FutInd) my G3427 son G5207.
021:008 But G1161 the fearful G1169, and G2532 unbelieving G0571, and G2532 the abominable G0948 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 murderers G5406, and G2532 whoremongers G4205, and G2532 sorcerers G5332, and G2532 idolaters G1496, and G2532 all G3956 liars G5571, shall have their G0846 part G3313 in G1722 the lake G3041 which G3588 burneth G2545 (PresPasPtc) with fire G4442 and G2532 brimstone G2303: which is G3603 (PresInd) the second G1208 death G2288.
021:009 And G2532 there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 me G3165 one of G1520 the seven G2033 angels G0032 which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) the seven G2033 vials G5357 full G1073 (PresActPtc) of the seven G2033 last G2078 plagues G4127, and G2532 talked G2980 (AorActInd) with G3326 me G1700, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Come hither G1204 (Impr), I will shew G1166 (FutActInd) thee G4671 the bride G3565, the Lamb’s G0721 wife G1135.
021:010 And G2532 he carried G0667 me G3165 away G0667 (AorActInd) in G1722 the spirit G4151 to G1909 a great G3173 and G2532 high G5308 mountain G3735, and G2532 shewed G1166 (AorActInd) me G3427 that great G3173 city G4172, the holy G0040 Jerusalem G2419, descending G2597 (PresActPtc) out of G1537 heaven G3772 from G0575 God G2316,
021:011 Having G2192 (PresActPtc) the glory G1391 of God G2316: and G2532 her G0846 light G5458 [was] like G3664 unto a stone G3037 most precious G5093, even like G5613 a jasper G2393 stone G3037, clear as crystal G2929 (PresActPtc);
021:012 And G5037 had G2192 (PresActPtc) a wall G5038 great G3173 and G2532 high G5308, [and] had G2192 (PresActPtc) twelve G1427 gates G4440, and G2532 at G1909 the gates G4440 twelve G1427 angels G0032, and G2532 names G3686 written thereon G1924 (PerfPasPtc), which G3739 are G2076 (PresInd) [the names] of the twelve G1427 tribes G5443 of the children G5207 of Israel G2474:
021:013 On G0575 the east G0395 three G5140 gates G4440; on G0575 the north G1005 three G5140 gates G4440; on G0575 the south G3558 three G5140 gates G4440; and G2532 on G0575 the west G1424 three G5140 gates G4440.
021:014 And G2532 the wall G5038 of the city G4172 had G2192 (PresActPtc) twelve G1427 foundations G2310, and G2532 in G1722 them G0846 the names G3686 of the twelve G1427 apostles G0652 of the Lamb G0721.
021:015 And G2532 he that talked G2980 (PresActPtc) with G3326 me G1700 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) a golden G5552 reed G2563 to G2443 measure G3354 (AorActSubj) the city G4172, and G2532 the gates G4440 thereof G0846, and G2532 the wall G5038 thereof G0846.
021:016 And G2532 the city G4172 lieth G2749 (PresMidPasDepInd) foursquare G5068, and G2532 the length G3372 G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) as large G5118 as G3745 G2532 the breadth G4114: and G2532 he measured G3354 (AorActInd) the city G4172 with the reed G2563 G1909, twelve G1427 thousand G5505 furlongs G4712. The length G3372 and G2532 the breadth G4114 and G2532 the height G5311 of it G0846 are G2076 (PresInd) equal G2470.
021:017 And G2532 he measured G3354 (AorActInd) the wall G5038 thereof G0846, an hundred G1540 [and] forty G5062 [and] four G5064 cubits G4083, [according to] the measure G3358 of a man G0444, that is G3603 (PresInd), of the angel G0032.
021:018 And G2532 the building G1739 of the wall G5038 of it G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) [of] jasper G2393: and G2532 the city G4172 [was] pure G2513 gold G5553, like G3664 unto clear G2513 glass G5194.
021:019 And G2532 the foundations G2310 of the wall G5038 of the city G4172 [were] garnished with G2885 (PerfPasPtc) all manner of G3956 precious G5093 stones G3037. The first G4413 foundation G2310 [was] jasper G2393; the second G1208, sapphire G4552; the third G5154, a chalcedony G5472; the fourth G5067, an emerald G4665;
021:020 The fifth G3991, sardonyx G4557; the sixth G1623, sardius G4556; the seventh G1442, chrysolite G5555; the eighth G3590, beryl G0969; the ninth G1766, a topaz G5116; the tenth G1182, a chrysoprasus G5556; the eleventh G1734, a jacinth G5192; the twelfth G1428, an amethyst G0271.
021:021 And G2532 the twelve G1427 gates G4440 [were] twelve G1427 pearls G3135; every G1538 G0303 several G1520 gate G4440 was G2258 (ImpfInd) of G1537 one G1520 pearl G3135: and G2532 the street G4113 of the city G4172 [was] pure G2513 gold G5553, as it were G5613 transparent G1307 glass G5194.
021:022 And G2532 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 temple G3485 therein G1722 G0846: for G1063 the Lord G2962 God G2316 Almighty G3841 and G2532 the Lamb G0721 are G2076 (PresInd) the temple G3485 of it G0846.
021:023 And G2532 the city G4172 had G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 need G5532 of the sun G2246, neither G3761 of the moon G4582, to G2443 shine G5316 (PresActSubj) in G1722 it G0846: for G1063 the glory G1391 of God G2316 did lighten G5461 (AorActInd) it G0846, and G2532 the Lamb G0721 [is] the light G3088 thereof G0846.
021:024 And G2532 the nations G1484 of them which are saved G4982 (PresPasPtc) shall walk G4043 (FutActInd) in G1722 the light G5457 of it G0846: and G2532 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093 do bring G5342 (PresActInd) their G0846 glory G1391 and G2532 honour G5092 into G1519 it G0846.
021:025 And G2532 the gates G4440 of it G0846 shall G2808 not G3364 be shut G2808 (AorPasSubj) at all G3364 by day G2250: for G1063 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3756 night G3571 there G1563.
021:026 And G2532 they shall bring G5342 (FutActInd) the glory G1391 and G2532 honour G5092 of the nations G1484 into G1519 it G0846.
021:027 And G2532 there shall G1525 in no wise G3364 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 it G0846 any thing G3956 that defileth G2840 (PresActPtc), neither G2532 [whatsoever] worketh G4160 (PresActPtc) abomination G0946, or G2532 [maketh] a lie G5579: but G1508 they which are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the Lamb’s G0721 book G0975 of life G2222.
022:001 ¶ And G2532 he shewed G1166 (AorActInd) me G3427 a pure G2513 river G4215 of water G5204 of life G2222, clear G2986 as G5613 crystal G2930, proceeding G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the throne G2362 of God G2316 and G2532 of the Lamb G0721.
022:002 In G1722 the midst G3319 of the street G4113 of it G0846, and G2532 on either G2532 side G1782 G1782 of the river G4215, [was there] the tree G3586 of life G2222, which bare G4160 (PresActPtc) twelve G1427 [manner of] fruits G2590, [and] yielded G0591 (PresActPtc) her G0846 fruit G2590 every G2596 G1538 G1520 month G3376: and G2532 the leaves G5444 of the tree G3586 [were] for G1519 the healing G2322 of the nations G1484.
022:003 And G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3756 more G2089 G3956 curse G2652: but G2532 the throne G2362 of God G2316 and G2532 of the Lamb G0721 shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 it G0846; and G2532 his G0846 servants G1401 shall serve G3000 (FutActInd) him G0846:
022:004 And G2532 they shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) his G0846 face G4383; and G2532 his G0846 name G3686 [shall be] in G1909 their G0846 foreheads G3359.
022:005 And G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3756 night G3571 there G1563; and G2532 they need G5532 no G3756 candle G3088 G2192 (PresActInd), neither G2532 light G5457 of the sun G2246; for G3754 the Lord G2962 God G2316 giveth G5461 them G0846 light G5461 (PresActInd): and G2532 they shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) for G1519 ever G0165 and ever G0165.
022:006 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, These G3778 sayings G3056 [are] faithful G4103 and G2532 true G0228: and G2532 the Lord G2962 God G2316 of the holy G0040 prophets G4396 sent G0649 (AorActInd) his G0846 angel G0032 to shew G1166 (AorActInf) unto his G0846 servants G1401 the things which G3739 must G1163 (PresInd) shortly G1722 G5034 be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf).
022:007 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) quickly G5035: blessed G3107 [is] he that keepeth G5083 (PresActPtc) the sayings G3056 of the prophecy G4394 of this G5127 book G0975.
022:008 And G2532 I G1473 John G2491 saw G0991 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, and G2532 heard G0191 (PresActPtc) [them]. And G2532 when G3753 I had heard G0191 (AorActInd) and G2532 seen G0991 (AorActInd), I fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) to worship G4352 (AorActInf) before G1715 the feet G4228 of the angel G0032 which G3588 shewed G1166 (PresActPtc) me G3427 these things G5023.
022:009 Then G2532 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, See G3708 (PresActImpr) [thou do it] not G3361: for G1063 I am G1510 (PresInd) thy G4675 fellowservant G4889, and G2532 of thy G4675 brethren G0080 the prophets G4396, and G2532 of them which keep G5083 (PresActPtc) the sayings G3056 of this G5127 book G0975: worship G4352 (AorActImpr) God G2316.
022:010 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto me G3427, Seal G4972 (AorActSubj) not G3361 the sayings G3056 of the prophecy G4394 of this G5127 book G0975: for G3754 the time G2540 is G2076 (PresInd) at hand G1451.
022:011 He that is unjust G0091 (PresActPtc), let him be unjust G0091 (AorActImpr) still G2089: and G2532 he which is filthy G4510 (PresActPtc), let him be filthy G4510 (AorActImpr) still G2089: and G2532 he that is righteous G1342, let him be righteous G1344 (AorPasImpr) still G2089: and G2532 he that is holy G0040, let him be holy G0037 (AorPasImpr) still G2089.
022:012 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) quickly G5035; and G2532 my G3450 reward G3408 [is] with G3326 me G1700, to give G0591 (Aor2ActInf) every man G1538 according as G5613 his G0846 work G2041 shall be G2071 (FutInd).
022:013 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Alpha G0001 and G2532 Omega G5598, the beginning G0746 and G2532 the end G5056, the first G4413 and G2532 the last G2078.
022:014 Blessed G3107 [are] they that do G4160 (PresActPtc) his G0846 commandments G1785, that G2443 they G0846 may have G2071 (FutInd) right G1849 to G1909 the tree G3586 of life G2222, and G2532 may enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) in through the gates G4440 into G1519 the city G4172.
022:015 For G1161 without G1854 [are] dogs G2965, and G2532 sorcerers G5333, and G2532 whoremongers G4205, and G2532 murderers G5406, and G2532 idolaters G1496, and G2532 whosoever G3956 loveth G5368 (PresActPtc) and G2532 maketh G4160 (PresActPtc) a lie G5579.
022:016 I G1473 Jesus G2424 have sent G3992 (AorActInd) mine G3450 angel G0032 to testify G3140 (AorActInf) unto you G5213 these things G5023 in G1909 the churches G1577. I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the root G4491 and G2532 the offspring G1085 of David G1138, [and] the bright G2986 and G2532 morning G3720 star G0792.
022:017 And G2532 the Spirit G4151 and G2532 the bride G3565 say G3004 (PresActInd), Come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). And G2532 let him that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr), Come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). And G2532 let him that is athirst G1372 (PresActPtc) come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). And G2532 whosoever will G2309 (PresActPtc), let him take G2983 (PresActImpr) the water G5204 of life G2222 freely G1432.
022:018 For G1063 I testify G4828 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto every man G3956 that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) the words G3056 of the prophecy G4394 of this G5127 book G0975, If G1437 any man G5100 shall add G2007 (PresActSubj) unto G4314 these things G5023, God G2316 shall add G2007 (FutActInd) unto G1909 him G0846 the plagues G4127 that are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 this G5129 book G0975:
022:019 And G2532 if G1437 any man G5100 shall take away G0851 (PresActSubj) from G0575 the words G3056 of the book G0976 of this G5129 prophecy G4394, God G2316 shall take away G0851 (FutActInd) his G0846 part G3313 out of G0575 the book G0976 of life G2222, and G2532 out of G1537 the holy G0040 city G4172, and G2532 [from] the things which are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 this G5026 book G0975.
022:020 He which testifieth G3140 (PresActPtc) these things G5023 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Surely G3483 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) quickly G5035. Amen G0281. Even so G3483, come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
022:021 The grace G5485 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 [be] with G3326 you G5216 all G3956. Amen G0281.
