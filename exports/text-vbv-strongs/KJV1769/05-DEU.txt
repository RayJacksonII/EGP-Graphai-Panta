001:001 ¶ These [be] the words H1697 which Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8765) unto all Israel H3478 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 in the wilderness H4057, in the plain H6160 over against H4136 the Red H5489 [sea], between Paran H6290, and Tophel H8603, and Laban H3837, and Hazeroth H2698, and Dizahab H1774.
001:002 ([There are] eleven H0259 H6240 days H3117 ’ [journey] from Horeb H2722 by the way H1870 of mount H2022 Seir H8165 unto Kadeshbarnea H6947.)
001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth H0705 year H8141, in the eleventh H6249 H6240 month H2320, on the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, [that] Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8765) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, according unto all that the LORD H3068 had given him in commandment H6680 (8765) unto them;
001:004 After H0310 he had slain H5221 (8687) Sihon H5511 the king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in Heshbon H2809, and Og H5747 the king H4428 of Bashan H1316, which dwelt H3427 (8802) at Astaroth H6252 in Edrei H0154:
001:005 On this side H5676 Jordan H3383, in the land H0776 of Moab H4124, began H2974 (8689) Moses H4872 to declare H0874 (8763) this law H8451, saying H0559 (8800),
001:006 The LORD H3068 our God H0430 spake H1696 (8765) unto us in Horeb H2722, saying H0559 (8800), Ye have dwelt H3427 (8800) long enough H7227 in this mount H2022:
001:007 Turn H6437 (8798) you, and take your journey H5265 (8798), and go H0935 (8798) to the mount H2022 of the Amorites H0567, and unto all [the places] nigh H7934 thereunto, in the plain H6160, in the hills H2022, and in the vale H8219, and in the south H5045, and by the sea H3220 side H2348, to the land H0776 of the Canaanites H3669, and unto Lebanon H3844, unto the great H1419 river H5104, the river H5104 Euphrates H6578.
001:008 Behold H7200 (8798), I have set H5414 (8804) the land H0776 before H6440 you: go H0935 (8798) in and possess H3423 (8798) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001, Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and Jacob H3290, to give H5414 (8800) unto them and to their seed H2233 after H0310 them.
001:009 And I spake H0559 (8799) unto you at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800), I am not able H3201 (8799) to bear H5375 (8800) you myself alone H0905:
001:010 The LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath multiplied H7235 (8689) you, and, behold, ye [are] this day H3117 as the stars H3556 of heaven H8064 for multitude H7230.
001:011 (The LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001 make you a thousand H0505 times H6471 so many more as H3254 (8686) ye [are], and bless H1288 (8762) you, as he hath promised H1696 (8765) you!)
001:012 How H0349 can I myself alone bear H5375 (8799) your cumbrance H2960, and your burden H4853, and your strife H7379?
001:013 Take H3051 (8798) you wise H2450 men H0582, and understanding H0995 (8737), and known H3045 (8803) among your tribes H7626, and I will make H7760 (8799) them rulers H7218 over you.
001:014 And ye answered H6030 (8799) me, and said H0559 (8799), The thing H1697 which thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) [is] good H2896 [for us] to do H6213 (8800).
001:015 So I took H3947 (8799) the chief H7218 of your tribes H7626, wise H2450 men H0582, and known H3045 (8803), and made H5414 (8799) them heads H7218 over you, captains H8269 over thousands H0505, and captains H8269 over hundreds H3967, and captains H8269 over fifties H2572, and captains H8269 over tens H6235, and officers H7860 (8802) among your tribes H7626.
001:016 And I charged H6680 (8762) your judges H8199 (8802) at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800), Hear H8085 (8800) [the causes] between your brethren H0251, and judge H8199 (8804) righteously H6664 between [every] man H0376 and his brother H0251, and the stranger H1616 [that is] with him.
001:017 Ye shall not respect H5234 (8686) persons H6440 in judgment H4941; [but] ye shall hear H8085 (8799) the small H6996 as well as the great H1419; ye shall not be afraid H1481 (8799) of the face H6440 of man H0376; for the judgment H4941 [is] God’s H0430: and the cause H1697 that is too hard H7185 (8799) for you, bring H7126 (8686) [it] unto me, and I will hear H8085 (8804) it.
001:018 And I commanded H6680 (8762) you at that time H6256 all the things H1697 which ye should do H6213 (8799).
001:019 And when we departed H5265 (8799) from Horeb H2722, we went through H3212 (8799) all that great H1419 and terrible H3372 (8737) wilderness H4057, which ye saw H7200 (8804) by the way H1870 of the mountain H2022 of the Amorites H0567, as the LORD H3068 our God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) us; and we came H0935 (8799) to Kadeshbarnea H6947.
001:020 And I said H0559 (8799) unto you, Ye are come H0935 (8804) unto the mountain H2022 of the Amorites H0567, which the LORD H3068 our God H0430 doth give H5414 (8802) unto us.
001:021 Behold H7200 (8798), the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath set H5414 (8804) the land H0776 before H6440 thee: go up H5927 (8798) [and] possess H3423 (8798) [it], as the LORD H3068 God H0430 of thy fathers H0001 hath said H1696 (8765) unto thee; fear H3372 (8799) not, neither be discouraged H2865 (8735).
001:022 And ye came near H7126 (8799) unto me every one of you, and said H0559 (8799), We will send H7971 (8799) men H0582 before H6440 us, and they shall search us out H2658 (8799) the land H0776, and bring H7725 us word H1697 again H7725 (8686) by what way H1870 we must go up H5927 (8799), and into what cities H5892 we shall come H0935 (8799).
001:023 And the saying H1697 pleased me well H3190 (8799) H5869: and I took H3947 (8799) twelve H8147 H6240 men H0582 of you, one H0259 of a tribe H0376 H7626:
001:024 And they turned H6437 (8799) and went up H5927 (8799) into the mountain H2022, and came H0935 (8799) unto the valley H5158 of Eshcol H0812, and searched it out H7270 (8762).
001:025 And they took H3947 (8799) of the fruit H6529 of the land H0776 in their hands H3027, and brought [it] down H3381 (8686) unto us, and brought H7725 us word H1697 again H7725 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), [It is] a good H2896 land H0776 which the LORD H3068 our God H0430 doth give H5414 (8802) us.
001:026 Notwithstanding ye would H0014 (8804) not go up H5927 (8800), but rebelled H4784 (8686) against the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430:
001:027 And ye murmured H7279 (8735) in your tents H0168, and said H0559 (8799), Because the LORD H3068 hated H8135 us, he hath brought us forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, to deliver H5414 (8800) us into the hand H3027 of the Amorites H0567, to destroy H8045 (8687) us.
001:028 Whither shall we go up H5927 (8802)? our brethren H0251 have discouraged H4549 (8689) our heart H3824, saying H0559 (8800), The people H5971 [is] greater H1419 and taller H7311 (8802) than we; the cities H5892 [are] great H1419 and walled up H1219 (8803) to heaven H8064; and moreover we have seen H7200 (8804) the sons H1121 of the Anakims H6062 there.
001:029 Then I said H0559 (8799) unto you, Dread H6206 (8799) not, neither be afraid H3372 (8799) of them.
001:030 The LORD H3068 your God H0430 which goeth H1980 (8802) before H6440 you, he shall fight H3898 (8735) for you, according to all that he did H6213 (8804) for you in Egypt H4714 before your eyes H5869;
001:031 And in the wilderness H4057, where thou hast seen H7200 (8804) how that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 bare H5375 (8804) thee, as a man H0376 doth bear H5375 (8799) his son H1121, in all the way H1870 that ye went H1980 (8804), until ye came H0935 (8800) into this place H4725.
001:032 Yet in this thing H1697 ye did not believe H0539 (8688) the LORD H3068 your God H0430,
001:033 Who went H1980 (8802) in the way H1870 before H6440 you, to search you out H8446 (8800) a place H4725 to pitch your tents H2583 (8800) [in], in fire H0784 by night H3915, to shew H7200 (8687) you by what way H1870 ye should go H3212 (8799), and in a cloud H6051 by day H3119.
001:034 And the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of your words H1697, and was wroth H7107 (8799), and sware H7650 (8735), saying H0559 (8800),
001:035 Surely there shall not one H0376 of these men H0582 of this evil H7451 generation H1755 see H7200 (8799) that good H2896 land H0776, which I sware H7650 (8738) to give H5414 (8800) unto your fathers H0001,
001:036 Save H2108 Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312; he shall see H7200 (8799) it, and to him will I give H5414 (8799) the land H0776 that H0834 he hath trodden upon H1869 (8804), and to his children H1121, because he hath wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 the LORD H3068.
001:037 Also the LORD H3068 was angry H0599 (8694) with me for your sakes H1558, saying H0559 (8800), Thou also shalt not go H0935 (8799) in thither H8033.
001:038 [But] Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, which standeth H5975 (8802) before H6440 thee, he shall go in H0935 (8799) thither: encourage H2388 (8761) him: for he shall cause Israel H3478 to inherit H5157 (8686) it.
001:039 Moreover your little ones H2945, which ye said H0559 (8804) should be a prey H0957, and your children H1121, which in that day H3117 had no knowledge H3045 (8804) between good H2896 and evil H7451, they shall go in H0935 (8799) thither, and unto them will I give H5414 (8799) it, and they shall possess H3423 (8799) it.
001:040 But [as for] you, turn H6437 (8798) you, and take your journey H5265 (8798) into the wilderness H4057 by the way H1870 of the Red H5488 sea H3220.
001:041 Then ye answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto me, We have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068, we will go up H5927 (8799) and fight H3898 (8738), according to all that the LORD H3068 our God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) us. And when ye had girded H2296 (8799) on every man H0376 his weapons H3627 of war H4421, ye were ready H1951 (8686) to go up H5927 (8800) into the hill H2022.
001:042 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Say H0559 (8798) unto them, Go not up H5927 (8799), neither fight H3898 (8735); for I [am] not among H7130 you; lest ye be smitten H5062 (8735) before H6440 your enemies H0341 (8802).
001:043 So I spake H1696 (8762) unto you; and ye would not hear H8085 (8804), but rebelled H4784 (8686) against the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, and went H5927 presumptuously H2102 (8686) up H5927 (8799) into the hill H2022.
001:044 And the Amorites H0567, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in that mountain H2022, came out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) you, and chased H7291 (8799) you, as bees H1682 do H6213 (8799), and destroyed H3807 (8686) you in Seir H8165, [even] unto Hormah H2767.
001:045 And ye returned H7725 (8799) and wept H1058 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068; but the LORD H3068 would not hearken H8085 (8804) to your voice H6963, nor give ear H0238 (8689) unto you.
001:046 So ye abode H3427 (8799) in Kadesh H6946 many H7227 days H3117, according unto the days H3117 that ye abode H3427 (8804) [there].
002:001 ¶ Then we turned H6437 (8799), and took our journey H5265 (8799) into the wilderness H4057 by the way H1870 of the Red H5488 sea H3220, as the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) unto me: and we compassed H5437 (8799) mount H2022 Seir H8165 many H7227 days H3117.
002:002 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
002:003 Ye have compassed H5437 (8800) this mountain H2022 long enough H7227: turn H6437 (8798) you northward H6828.
002:004 And command H6680 (8761) thou the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Ye [are] to pass H5674 (8802) through the coast H1366 of your brethren H0251 the children H1121 of Esau H6215, which dwell H3427 (8802) in Seir H8165; and they shall be afraid H3372 (8799) of you: take ye good H3966 heed H8104 (8738) unto yourselves therefore:
002:005 Meddle H1624 (8691) not with them; for I will not give H5414 (8799) you of their land H0776, no, not so much as a foot H7272 breadth H4096 H3709; because I have given H5414 (8804) mount H2022 Seir H8165 unto Esau H6215 [for] a possession H3425.
002:006 Ye shall buy H7666 (8799) meat H0400 of them for money H3701, that ye may eat H0398 (8804); and ye shall also buy H3739 (8799) water H4325 of them for money H3701, that ye may drink H8354 (8804).
002:007 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8765) thee in all the works H4639 of thy hand H3027: he knoweth H3045 (8804) thy walking H3212 (8800) through this great H1419 wilderness H4057: these forty H0705 years H8141 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked H2637 (8804) nothing H1697.
002:008 And when we passed H5674 (8799) by from our brethren H0251 the children H1121 of Esau H6215, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in Seir H8165, through the way H1870 of the plain H6160 from Elath H0359, and from Eziongaber H6100, we turned H6437 (8799) and passed H5674 (8799) by the way H1870 of the wilderness H4057 of Moab H4124.
002:009 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Distress H6696 (8799) not the Moabites H4124, neither contend H1624 (8691) with them in battle H4421: for I will not give H5414 (8799) thee of their land H0776 [for] a possession H3425; because I have given H5414 (8804) Ar H6144 unto the children H1121 of Lot H3876 [for] a possession H3425.
002:010 The Emims H0368 dwelt H3427 (8804) therein in times past H6440, a people H5971 great H1419, and many H7227, and tall H7311 (8802), as the Anakims H6062;
002:011 Which H1992 also were accounted H2803 (8735) giants H7497, as the Anakims H6062; but the Moabites H4125 call H7121 (8799) them Emims H0368.
002:012 The Horims H2752 also dwelt H3427 (8804) in Seir H8165 beforetime H6440; but the children H1121 of Esau H6215 succeeded H3423 (8799) them, when they had destroyed H8045 (8686) them from before H6440 them, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in their stead; as Israel H3478 did H6213 (8804) unto the land H0776 of his possession H3425, which the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804) unto them.
002:013 Now rise up H6965 (8798), [said I], and get you over H5674 (8798) the brook H5158 Zered H2218. And we went over H5674 (8799) the brook H5158 Zered H2218.
002:014 And the space H3117 in which we came H1980 (8804) from Kadeshbarnea H6947, until we were come over H5674 (8804) the brook H5158 Zered H2218, [was] thirty H7970 and eight H8083 years H8141; until all the generation H1755 of the men H0582 of war H4421 were wasted out H8552 (8800) from among H7130 the host H4264, as the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto them.
002:015 For indeed the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 was against them, to destroy H2000 (8800) them from among H7130 the host H4264, until they were consumed H8552 (8800).
002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men H0582 of war H4421 were consumed H8552 (8804) and dead H4191 (8800) from among H7130 the people H5971,
002:017 That the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
002:018 Thou art to pass over H5674 (8802) through Ar H6144, the coast H1366 of Moab H4124, this day H3117:
002:019 And [when] thou comest nigh H7126 (8804) over against H4136 the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, distress H6696 (8799) them not, nor meddle H1624 (8691) with them: for I will not give H5414 (8799) thee of the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 [any] possession H3425; because I have given H5414 (8804) it unto the children H1121 of Lot H3876 [for] a possession H3425.
002:020 (That also was accounted H2803 (8735) a land H0776 of giants H7497: giants H7497 dwelt H3427 (8804) therein in old time H6440; and the Ammonites H5984 call H7121 (8799) them Zamzummims H2157;
002:021 A people H5971 great H1419, and many H7227, and tall H7311 (8802), as the Anakims H6062; but the LORD H3068 destroyed H8045 (8686) them before H6440 them; and they succeeded H3423 (8799) them, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in their stead:
002:022 As he did H6213 (8804) to the children H1121 of Esau H6215, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in Seir H8165, when he destroyed H8045 (8689) the Horims H2752 from before H6440 them; and they succeeded H3423 (8799) them, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in their stead even unto this day H3117:
002:023 And the Avims H5761 which dwelt H3427 (8802) in Hazerim H2699, [even] unto Azzah H5804, the Caphtorims H3732, which came forth H3318 (8802) out of Caphtor H3731, destroyed H8045 (8689) them, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in their stead.)
002:024 Rise ye up H6965 (8798), take your journey H5265 (8798), and pass over H5674 (8798) the river H5158 Arnon H0769: behold H7200 (8798), I have given H5414 (8804) into thine hand H3027 Sihon H5511 the Amorite H0567, king H4428 of Heshbon H2809, and his land H0776: begin H2490 (8685) to possess H3423 (8798) [it], and contend H1624 (8690) with him in battle H4421.
002:025 This day H3117 will I begin H2490 (8686) to put H5414 (8800) the dread H6343 of thee and the fear H3374 of thee upon the nations H6440 H5971 [that are] under the whole heaven H8064, who shall hear H8085 (8799) report H8088 of thee, and shall tremble H7264 (8804), and be in anguish H2342 (8804) because of thee H6440.
002:026 And I sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 out of the wilderness H4057 of Kedemoth H6932 unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809 with words H1697 of peace H7965, saying H0559 (8800),
002:027 Let me pass H5674 (8799) through thy land H0776: I will go H3212 (8799) along by the high way H1870 H1870, I will neither turn H5493 (8799) unto the right hand H3225 nor to the left H8040.
002:028 Thou shalt sell H7666 (8686) me meat H0400 for money H3701, that I may eat H0398 (8804); and give H5414 (8799) me water H4325 for money H3701, that I may drink H8354 (8804): only I will pass through H5674 (8799) on my feet H7272;
002:029 (As the children H1121 of Esau H6215 which dwell H3427 (8802) in Seir H8165, and the Moabites H4125 which dwell H3427 (8802) in Ar H6144, did H6213 (8804) unto me;) until I shall pass over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383 into the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 our God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) us.
002:030 But Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809 would H0014 (8804) not let us pass H5674 (8687) by him: for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hardened H7185 (8689) his spirit H7307, and made his heart H3824 obstinate H0553 (8765), that he might deliver H5414 (8800) him into thy hand H3027, as [appeareth] this day H3117.
002:031 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Behold H7200 (8798), I have begun H2490 (8689) to give H5414 (8800) Sihon H5511 and his land H0776 before H6440 thee: begin H2490 (8685) to possess H3423 (8798), that thou mayest inherit H3423 (8800) his land H0776.
002:032 Then Sihon H5511 came out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) us, he and all his people H5971, to fight H4421 at Jahaz H3096.
002:033 And the LORD H3068 our God H0430 delivered H5414 (8799) him before H6440 us; and we smote H5221 (8686) him, and his sons H1121, and all his people H5971.
002:034 And we took H3920 (8799) all his cities H5892 at that time H6256, and utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) the men H4962, and the women H0802, and the little ones H2945, of every city H5892, we left H7604 (8689) none to remain H8300:
002:035 Only the cattle H0929 we took for a prey H0962 (8804) unto ourselves, and the spoil H7998 of the cities H5892 which we took H3920 (8804).
002:036 From Aroer H6177, which [is] by the brink H8193 of the river H5158 of Arnon H0769, and [from] the city H5892 that [is] by the river H5158, even unto Gilead H1568, there was not one city H7151 too strong H7682 (8804) for us: the LORD H3068 our God H0430 delivered H5414 (8804) all unto us H6440:
002:037 Only unto the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 thou camest H7126 (8804) not, [nor] unto any place H3027 of the river H5158 Jabbok H2999, nor unto the cities H5892 in the mountains H2022, nor unto whatsoever the LORD H3068 our God H0430 forbad H6680 (8765) us.
003:001 ¶ Then we turned H6437 (8799), and went up H5927 (8799) the way H1870 to Bashan H1316: and Og H5747 the king H4428 of Bashan H1316 came out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) us, he and all his people H5971, to battle H4421 at Edrei H0154.
003:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Fear H3372 (8799) him not: for I will deliver H5414 (8804) him, and all his people H5971, and his land H0776, into thy hand H3027; and thou shalt do H6213 (8804) unto him as thou didst H6213 (8804) unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which dwelt H3427 (8802) at Heshbon H2809.
003:003 So the LORD H3068 our God H0430 delivered H5414 (8799) into our hands H3027 Og H5747 also, the king H4428 of Bashan H1316, and all his people H5971: and we smote H5221 (8686) him until none was left H7604 (8689) to him remaining H8300.
003:004 And we took H3920 (8799) all his cities H5892 at that time H6256, there was not a city H7151 which we took H3947 (8804) not from them, threescore H8346 cities H5892, all the region H2256 of Argob H0709, the kingdom H4467 of Og H5747 in Bashan H1316.
003:005 All these cities H5892 [were] fenced H1219 (8803) with high H1364 walls H2346, gates H1817, and bars H1280; beside unwalled H6521 towns H5892 a great H3966 many H7235 (8687).
003:006 And we utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) them, as we did H6213 (8804) unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809, utterly destroying H2763 (8687) the men H4962, women H0802, and children H2945, of every city H5892.
003:007 But all the cattle H0929, and the spoil H7998 of the cities H5892, we took for a prey H0962 (8804) to ourselves.
003:008 And we took H3947 at that time H6256 out H3947 (8799) of the hand H3027 of the two H8147 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567 the land H0776 that [was] on this side H5676 Jordan H3383, from the river H5158 of Arnon H0769 unto mount H2022 Hermon H2768;
003:009 ([Which] Hermon H2768 the Sidonians H6722 call H7121 (8799) Sirion H8303; and the Amorites H0567 call H7121 (8799) it Shenir H8149;)
003:010 All the cities H5892 of the plain H4334, and all Gilead H1568, and all Bashan H1316, unto Salchah H5548 and Edrei H0154, cities H5892 of the kingdom H4467 of Og H5747 in Bashan H1316.
003:011 For only Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316 remained H7604 (8738) of the remnant H3499 of giants H7497; behold, his bedstead H6210 [was] a bedstead H6210 of iron H1270; [is] it not H3808 in Rabbath H7237 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983? nine H8672 cubits H0520 [was] the length H0753 thereof, and four H0702 cubits H0520 the breadth H7341 of it, after the cubit H0520 of a man H0376.
003:012 And this land H0776, [which] we possessed H3423 (8804) at that time H6256, from Aroer H6177, which [is] by the river H5158 Arnon H0769, and half H2677 mount H2022 Gilead H1568, and the cities H5892 thereof, gave H5414 (8804) I unto the Reubenites H7206 and to the Gadites H1425.
003:013 And the rest H3499 of Gilead H1568, and all Bashan H1316, [being] the kingdom H4467 of Og H5747, gave H5414 (8804) I unto the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519; all the region H2256 of Argob H0709, with all Bashan H1316, which H1931 was called H7121 (8735) the land H0776 of giants H7497.
003:014 Jair H2971 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519 took H3947 (8804) all the country H2256 of Argob H0709 unto the coasts H1366 of Geshuri H1651 and Maachathi H4602; and called H7121 (8799) them after his own name H8034, Bashanhavothjair H1316 H2334, unto this day H3117.
003:015 And I gave H5414 (8804) Gilead H1568 unto Machir H4353.
003:016 And unto the Reubenites H7206 and unto the Gadites H1425 I gave H5414 (8804) from Gilead H1568 even unto the river H5158 Arnon H0769 half H8432 the valley H5158, and the border H1366 even unto the river H5158 Jabbok H2999, [which is] the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983;
003:017 The plain H6160 also, and Jordan H3383, and the coast H1366 [thereof], from Chinnereth H3672 even unto the sea H3220 of the plain H6160, [even] the salt H4417 sea H3220, under Ashdothpisgah H0798 (8676) H0794 eastward H4217.
003:018 And I commanded H6680 (8762) you at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) you this land H0776 to possess H3423 (8800) it: ye shall pass over H5674 (8799) armed H2502 (8803) before H6440 your brethren H0251 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, all [that are] meet H1121 for the war H2428.
003:019 But your wives H0802, and your little ones H2945, and your cattle H4735, ([for] I know H3045 (8804) that ye have much H7227 cattle H4735,) shall abide H3427 (8799) in your cities H5892 which I have given H5414 (8804) you;
003:020 Until the LORD H3068 have given rest H5117 (8686) unto your brethren H0251, as well as unto you, and [until] they also possess H3423 (8804) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given H5414 (8802) them beyond H5676 Jordan H3383: and [then] shall ye return H7725 (8804) every man H0376 unto his possession H3425, which I have given H5414 (8804) you.
003:021 And I commanded H6680 (8765) Joshua H3091 at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800), Thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8802) all that the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath done H6213 (8804) unto these two H8147 kings H4428: so shall the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) unto all the kingdoms H4467 whither thou passest H5674 (8802).
003:022 Ye shall not fear H3372 (8799) them: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 he shall fight H3898 (8737) for you.
003:023 And I besought H2603 (8691) the LORD H3068 at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800),
003:024 O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, thou hast begun H2490 (8689) to shew H7200 (8687) thy servant H5650 thy greatness H1433, and thy mighty H2389 hand H3027: for what God H0410 [is there] in heaven H8064 or in earth H0776, that can do H6213 (8799) according to thy works H4639, and according to thy might H1369?
003:025 I pray thee, let me go over H5674 (8799), and see H7200 (8799) the good H2896 land H0776 that [is] beyond H5676 Jordan H3383, that goodly H2896 mountain H2022, and Lebanon H3844.
003:026 But the LORD H3068 was wroth H5674 (8691) with me for your sakes, and would not hear H8085 (8804) me: and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Let it suffice H7227 thee; speak H1696 (8763) no more H3254 (8686) unto me of this matter H1697.
003:027 Get thee up H5927 (8798) into the top H7218 of Pisgah H6449, and lift up H5375 (8798) thine eyes H5869 westward H3220, and northward H6828, and southward H8486, and eastward H4217, and behold H7200 (8798) [it] with thine eyes H5869: for thou shalt not go over H5674 (8799) this Jordan H3383.
003:028 But charge H6680 (8761) Joshua H3091, and encourage H2388 (8761) him, and strengthen H0553 (8761) him: for he shall go over H5674 (8799) before H6440 this people H5971, and he shall cause them to inherit H5157 (8686) the land H0776 which thou shalt see H7200 (8799).
003:029 So we abode H3427 (8799) in the valley H1516 over against H4136 Bethpeor H1047.
004:001 ¶ Now therefore hearken H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478, unto the statutes H2706 and unto the judgments H4941, which I teach H3925 (8764) you, for to do H6213 (8800) [them], that ye may live H2421 (8799), and go in H0935 (8804) and possess H3423 (8804) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001 giveth H5414 (8802) you.
004:002 Ye shall not add H3254 (8686) unto the word H1697 which I command H6680 (8764) you, neither shall ye diminish H1639 (8799) [ought] from it, that ye may keep H8104 (8800) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430 which I command H6680 (8764) you.
004:003 Your eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8802) what the LORD H3068 did H6213 (8804) because of Baalpeor H1187: for all the men H0376 that followed H0310 H1980 (8804) Baalpeor H1187, the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath destroyed H8045 (8689) them from among H7130 you.
004:004 But ye that did cleave H1695 unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [are] alive H2416 every one of you this day H3117.
004:005 Behold H7200 (8798), I have taught H3925 (8765) you statutes H2706 and judgments H4941, even as H0834 the LORD H3068 my God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) me, that ye should do H6213 (8800) so in H7130 the land H0776 whither ye go H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
004:006 Keep H8104 (8804) therefore and do H6213 (8804) [them]; for this [is] your wisdom H2451 and your understanding H0998 in the sight H5869 of the nations H5971, which shall hear H8085 (8799) all these statutes H2706, and say H0559 (8804), Surely this great H1419 nation H1471 [is] a wise H2450 and understanding H0995 (8737) people H5971.
004:007 For what nation H1471 [is there so] great H1419, who [hath] God H0430 [so] nigh H7138 unto them, as the LORD H3068 our God H0430 [is] in all [things that] we call H7121 (8800) upon him [for]?
004:008 And what nation H1471 [is there so] great H1419, that hath statutes H2706 and judgments H4941 [so] righteous H6662 as all this law H8451, which I set H5414 (8802) before H6440 you this day H3117?
004:009 Only take heed H8104 (8734) to thyself, and keep H8104 (8798) thy soul H5315 diligently H3966, lest thou forget H7911 (8799) the things H1697 which thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804), and lest they depart H5493 (8799) from thy heart H3824 all the days H3117 of thy life H2416: but teach H3045 (8689) them thy sons H1121, and thy sons H1121 ’ sons H1121;
004:010 [Specially] the day H3117 that thou stoodest H5975 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in Horeb H2722, when the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8800) unto me, Gather H6950 me the people H5971 together H6950 (8685), and I will make them hear H8085 (8686) my words H1697, that they may learn H3925 (8799) to fear H3372 (8800) me all the days H3117 that they shall live H2416 upon the earth H0127, and [that] they may teach H3925 (8762) their children H1121.
004:011 And ye came near H7126 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) under the mountain H2022; and the mountain H2022 burned H1197 (8802) with fire H0784 unto the midst H3820 of heaven H8064, with darkness H6205, clouds H6051, and thick darkness H2822.
004:012 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto you out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784: ye heard H8085 (8802) the voice H6963 of the words H1697, but saw H7200 (8802) no similitude H8544; only H2108 [ye heard] a voice H6963.
004:013 And he declared H5046 (8686) unto you his covenant H1285, which he commanded H6680 (8765) you to perform H6213 (8800), [even] ten H6235 commandments H1697; and he wrote H3789 (8799) them upon two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068.
004:014 And the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) me at that time H6256 to teach H3925 (8763) you statutes H2706 and judgments H4941, that ye might do H6213 (8800) them in the land H0776 whither ye go over H5674 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
004:015 Take ye therefore good H3966 heed H8104 (8738) unto yourselves H5315; for ye saw H7200 (8804) no manner of similitude H8544 on the day H3117 [that] the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8763) unto you in Horeb H2722 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784:
004:016 Lest ye corrupt H7843 (8686) [yourselves], and make H6213 (8804) you a graven image H6459, the similitude H8544 of any figure H5566, the likeness H8403 of male H2145 or female H5347,
004:017 The likeness H8403 of any beast H0929 that [is] on the earth H0776, the likeness H8403 of any winged H3671 fowl H6833 that flieth H5774 (8799) in the air H8064,
004:018 The likeness H8403 of any thing that creepeth H7430 (8802) on the ground H0127, the likeness H8403 of any fish H1710 that [is] in the waters H4325 beneath H8478 the earth H0776:
004:019 And lest thou lift up H5375 (8799) thine eyes H5869 unto heaven H8064, and when thou seest H7200 (8804) the sun H8121, and the moon H3394, and the stars H3556, [even] all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, shouldest be driven H5080 (8738) to worship H7812 (8694) them, and serve H5647 (8804) them, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath divided H2505 (8804) unto all nations H5971 under the whole heaven H8064.
004:020 But the LORD H3068 hath taken H3947 (8804) you, and brought you forth H3318 (8686) out of the iron H1270 furnace H3564, [even] out of Egypt H4714, to be unto him a people H5971 of inheritance H5159, as [ye are] this day H3117.
004:021 Furthermore the LORD H3068 was angry H0599 (8694) with me for your sakes H1697, and sware H7650 (8735) that I should not go over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383, and that I should not go H0935 (8800) in unto that good H2896 land H0776, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159:
004:022 But I must die H4191 (8801) in this land H0776, I must not go over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383: but ye shall go over H5674 (8802), and possess H3423 (8804) that good H2896 land H0776.
004:023 Take heed H8104 (8734) unto yourselves, lest ye forget H7911 (8799) the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which he made H3772 (8804) with you, and make H6213 (8804) you a graven image H6459, [or] the likeness H8544 of any H3605 [thing], which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath forbidden H6680 (8765) thee.
004:024 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] a consuming H0398 (8802) fire H0784, [even] a jealous H7067 God H0410.
004:025 When thou shalt beget H3205 (8686) children H1121, and children’s H1121 children H1121, and ye shall have remained long H3462 (8738) in the land H0776, and shall corrupt H7843 (8689) [yourselves], and make H6213 (8804) a graven image H6459, [or] the likeness H8544 of any [thing], and shall do H6213 (8804) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to provoke him to anger H3707 (8687):
004:026 I call H5749 heaven H8064 and earth H0776 to witness H5749 (8689) against you this day H3117, that ye shall soon H4118 utterly H0006 (8800) perish H0006 (8799) from off the land H0776 whereunto ye go over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 to possess H3423 (8800) it; ye shall not prolong H0748 (8686) [your] days H3117 upon it, but shall utterly H8045 (8736) be destroyed H8045 (8735).
004:027 And the LORD H3068 shall scatter H6327 (8689) you among the nations H5971, and ye shall be left H7604 (8738) few H4962 in number H4557 among the heathen H1471, whither the LORD H3068 shall lead H5090 (8762) you.
004:028 And there ye shall serve H5647 (8804) gods H0430, the work H4639 of men’s H0120 hands H3027, wood H6086 and stone H0068, which neither see H7200 (8799), nor hear H8085 (8799), nor eat H0398 (8799), nor smell H7306 (8686).
004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek H1245 (8765) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, thou shalt find H4672 (8804) [him], if thou seek H1875 (8799) him with all thy heart H3824 and with all thy soul H5315.
004:030 When thou art in tribulation H6862, and all these things H1697 are come H4672 (8804) upon thee, [even] in the latter H0319 days H3117, if thou turn H7725 (8804) to the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and shalt be obedient H8085 (8804) unto his voice H6963;
004:031 (For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] a merciful H7349 God H0410;) he will not forsake H7503 (8686) thee, neither destroy H7843 (8686) thee, nor forget H7911 (8799) the covenant H1285 of thy fathers H0001 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto them.
004:032 For ask H7592 (8798) now of the days H3117 that are past H7223, which were H1961 (8738) before H6440 thee, since the day H3117 that God H0430 created H1254 (8804) man H0120 upon the earth H0776, and [ask] from the one side H7097 of heaven H8064 unto the other, whether there hath been [any such thing] as this great H1419 thing H1697 [is], or hath been heard H8085 (8738) like it?
004:033 Did [ever] people H5971 hear H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of God H0430 speaking out H1696 (8764) of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784, as thou hast heard H8085 (8804), and live H2421 (8799)?
004:034 Or hath God H0430 assayed H5254 (8765) to go H0935 (8800) [and] take H3947 (8800) him a nation H1471 from the midst H7130 of [another] nation H1471, by temptations H4531, by signs H0226, and by wonders H4159, and by war H4421, and by a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and by a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, and by great H1419 terrors H4172, according to all that the LORD H3068 your God H0430 did H6213 (8804) for you in Egypt H4714 before your eyes H5869?
004:035 Unto thee it was shewed H7200 (8717), that thou mightest know H3045 (8800) that the LORD H3068 he [is] God H0430; [there is] none else H5750 beside him H0905.
004:036 Out of heaven H8064 he made thee to hear H8085 (8689) his voice H6963, that he might instruct H3256 (8763) thee: and upon earth H0776 he shewed H7200 (8689) thee his great H1419 fire H0784; and thou heardest H8085 (8804) his words H1697 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784.
004:037 And because he loved H0157 (8804) thy fathers H0001, therefore he chose H0977 (8799) their seed H2233 after H0310 them, and brought thee out H3318 (8686) in his sight H6440 with his mighty H1419 power H3581 out of Egypt H4714;
004:038 To drive out H3423 (8687) nations H1471 from before H6440 thee greater H1419 and mightier H6099 than thou [art], to bring H0935 (8687) thee in, to give H5414 (8800) thee their land H0776 [for] an inheritance H5159, as [it is] this day H3117.
004:039 Know H3045 (8804) therefore this day H3117, and consider H7725 (8689) [it] in thine heart H3824, that the LORD H3068 he [is] God H0430 in heaven H8064 above H4605, and upon the earth H0776 beneath: [there is] none else.
004:040 Thou shalt keep H8104 (8804) therefore his statutes H2706, and his commandments H4687, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, that it may go well H3190 (8799) with thee, and with thy children H1121 after H0310 thee, and that thou mayest prolong H0748 (8686) [thy] days H3117 upon the earth H0127, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, for ever.
004:041 Then Moses H4872 severed H0914 (8686) three H7969 cities H5892 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 toward the sunrising H8121 H4217;
004:042 That the slayer H7523 (8802) might flee H5127 (8800) thither, which should kill H7523 (8799) his neighbour H7453 unawares H1097 H1847, and hated H8130 (8802) him not in times H8543 past H8032; and that fleeing H5127 (8804) unto one H0259 of these H0411 cities H5892 he might live H2425 (8804):
004:043 [Namely], Bezer H1221 in the wilderness H4057, in the plain H4334 country H0776, of the Reubenites H7206; and Ramoth H7216 in Gilead H1568, of the Gadites H1425; and Golan H1474 in Bashan H1316, of the Manassites H4520.
004:044 And this [is] the law H8451 which Moses H4872 set H7760 (8804) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478:
004:045 These [are] the testimonies H5713, and the statutes H2706, and the judgments H4941, which Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8765) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, after they came forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714,
004:046 On this side H5676 Jordan H3383, in the valley H1516 over against H4136 Bethpeor H1047, in the land H0776 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, who dwelt H3427 (8802) at Heshbon H2809, whom Moses H4872 and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 smote H5221 (8689), after they were come forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714:
004:047 And they possessed H3423 (8799) his land H0776, and the land H0776 of Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, two H8147 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which [were] on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 toward the sunrising H4217 H8121;
004:048 From Aroer H6177, which [is] by the bank H8193 of the river H5158 Arnon H0769, even unto mount H2022 Sion H7865, which [is] Hermon H2768,
004:049 And all the plain H6160 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 eastward H4217, even unto the sea H3220 of the plain H6160, under the springs H0794 of Pisgah H6449.
005:001 ¶ And Moses H4872 called H7121 (8799) all Israel H3478, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478, the statutes H2706 and judgments H4941 which I speak H1696 (8802) in your ears H0241 this day H3117, that ye may learn H3925 (8804) them, and keep H8104 (8804), and do H6213 (8800) them.
005:002 The LORD H3068 our God H0430 made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with us in Horeb H2722.
005:003 The LORD H3068 made H3772 (8804) not this covenant H1285 with our fathers H0001, but with us H0587, [even] us, who [are] all of us H0428 here alive H2416 this day H3117.
005:004 The LORD H3068 talked H1696 (8765) with you face H6440 to face H6440 in the mount H2022 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784,
005:005 (I stood H5975 (8802) between the LORD H3068 and you at that time H6256, to shew H5046 (8687) you the word H1697 of the LORD H3068: for ye were afraid H3372 (8804) by reason H6440 of the fire H0784, and went not up H5927 (8804) into the mount H2022;) saying H0559 (8800),
005:006 I [am] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which brought thee out H3318 (8689) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the house H1004 of bondage H5650.
005:007 Thou shalt have none other H0312 gods H0430 before H6440 me.
005:008 Thou shalt not make H6213 (8799) thee [any] graven image H6459, [or] any likeness H8544 [of any thing] that [is] in heaven H8064 above H4605, or that [is] in the earth H0776 beneath, or that [is] in the waters H4325 beneath the earth H0776:
005:009 Thou shalt not bow down H7812 (8691) thyself unto them, nor serve H5647 (8714) them: for I the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [am] a jealous H7067 God H0410, visiting H6485 (8802) the iniquity H5771 of the fathers H0001 upon the children H1121 unto the third H8029 and fourth H7256 [generation] of them that hate H8130 (8802) me,
005:010 And shewing H6213 (8802) mercy H2617 unto thousands H0505 of them that love H0157 (8802) me and keep H8104 (8802) my commandments H4687.
005:011 Thou shalt not take H5375 (8799) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in vain H7723: for the LORD H3068 will not hold [him] guiltless H5352 (8762) that taketh H5375 (8799) his name H8034 in vain H7723.
005:012 Keep H8104 (8800) the sabbath H7676 day H3117 to sanctify H6942 (8763) it, as the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) thee.
005:013 Six H8337 days H3117 thou shalt labour H5647 (8799), and do H6213 (8804) all thy work H4399:
005:014 But the seventh H7637 day H3117 [is] the sabbath H7676 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: [in it] thou shalt not do H6213 (8799) any work H4399, thou, nor thy son H1121, nor thy daughter H1323, nor thy manservant H5650, nor thy maidservant H0519, nor thine ox H7794, nor thine ass H2543, nor any of thy cattle H0929, nor thy stranger H1616 that [is] within thy gates H8179; that thy manservant H5650 and thy maidservant H0519 may rest H5117 (8799) as well as thou.
005:015 And remember H2142 (8804) that thou wast a servant H5650 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and [that] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 brought H3318 (8686) thee out thence through a mighty H2389 hand H3027 and by a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220: therefore the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) thee to keep H6213 (8800) the sabbath H7676 day H3117.
005:016 Honour H3513 (8761) thy father H0001 and thy mother H0517, as the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) thee; that thy days H3117 may be prolonged H0748 (8686), and that it may go well H3190 (8799) with thee, in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee.
005:017 Thou shalt not kill H7523 (8799).
005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery H5003 (8799).
005:019 Neither shalt thou steal H1589 (8799).
005:020 Neither shalt thou bear H6030 (8799) false H7723 witness H5707 against thy neighbour H7453.
005:021 Neither shalt thou desire H2530 (8799) thy neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802, neither shalt thou covet H0183 (8691) thy neighbour’s H7453 house H1004, his field H7704, or his manservant H5650, or his maidservant H0519, his ox H7794, or his ass H2543, or any [thing] that [is] thy neighbour’s H7453.
005:022 These words H1697 the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) unto all your assembly H6951 in the mount H2022 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784, of the cloud H6051, and of the thick darkness H6205, with a great H1419 voice H6963: and he added no more H3254 (8804). And he wrote H3789 (8799) them in two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068, and delivered H5414 (8799) them unto me.
005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 out of the midst H8432 of the darkness H2822, (for the mountain H2022 did burn H1197 (8802) with fire H0784,) that ye came near H7126 (8799) unto me, [even] all the heads H7218 of your tribes H7626, and your elders H2205;
005:024 And ye said H0559 (8799), Behold, the LORD H3068 our God H0430 hath shewed H7200 (8689) us his glory H3519 and his greatness H1433, and we have heard H8085 (8804) his voice H6963 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784: we have seen H7200 (8804) this day H3117 that God H0430 doth talk H1696 (8762) with man H0120, and he liveth H2425 (8804).
005:025 Now therefore why should we die H4191 (8799)? for this great H1419 fire H0784 will consume H0398 (8799) us: if we hear H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430 any more H3254 (8802), then we shall die H4191 (8804).
005:026 For who [is there of] all flesh H1320, that hath heard H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the living H2416 God H0430 speaking H1696 (8764) out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784, as we [have], and lived H2421 (8799)?
005:027 Go thou near H7126 (8798), and hear H8085 (8798) all that the LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall say H0559 (8799): and speak H1696 (8762) thou unto us all that the LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall speak H1696 (8762) unto thee; and we will hear H8085 (8804) [it], and do H6213 (8804) [it].
005:028 And the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of your words H1697, when ye spake H1696 (8763) unto me; and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, I have heard H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the words H1697 of this people H5971, which they have spoken H1696 (8765) unto thee: they have well H3190 (8689) said all that they have spoken H1696 (8765).
005:029 O that there were such H2088 an H4310 heart H3824 in them H5414 (8799), that they would fear H3372 (8800) me, and keep H8104 (8800) all my commandments H4687 always H3117, that it might be well H3190 (8799) with them, and with their children H1121 for ever H5769!
005:030 Go H3212 (8798) say H0559 (8798) to them, Get H7725 you into your tents H0168 again H7725 (8798).
005:031 But as for thee, stand H5975 (8798) thou here by me H5978, and I will speak H1696 (8762) unto thee all the commandments H4687, and the statutes H2706, and the judgments H4941, which thou shalt teach H3925 (8762) them, that they may do H6213 (8804) [them] in the land H0776 which I give H5414 (8802) them to possess H3423 (8800) it.
005:032 Ye shall observe H8104 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) therefore as the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) you: ye shall not turn aside H5493 (8799) to the right hand H3225 or to the left H8040.
005:033 Ye shall walk H3212 (8799) in all the ways H1870 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) you, that ye may live H2421 (8799), and [that it may be] well H2895 (8804) with you, and [that] ye may prolong H0748 (8689) [your] days H3117 in the land H0776 which ye shall possess H3423 (8799).
006:001 ¶ Now these [are] the commandments H4687, the statutes H2706, and the judgments H4941, which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) to teach H3925 (8763) you, that ye might do H6213 (8800) [them] in the land H0776 whither ye go H5674 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it:
006:002 That thou mightest fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to keep H8104 (8800) all his statutes H2708 and his commandments H4687, which I command H6680 (8764) thee, thou, and thy son H1121, and thy son’s H1121 son H1121, all the days H3117 of thy life H2416; and that thy days H3117 may be prolonged H0748 (8686).
006:003 Hear H8085 (8804) therefore, O Israel H3478, and observe H8104 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) [it]; that it may be well H3190 (8799) with thee, and that ye may increase H7235 (8799) mightily H3966, as the LORD H3068 God H0430 of thy fathers H0001 hath promised H1696 (8765) thee, in the land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
006:004 Hear H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478: The LORD H3068 our God H0430 [is] one H0259 LORD H3068:
006:005 And thou shalt love H0157 (8804) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with all thine heart H3824, and with all thy soul H5315, and with all thy might H3966.
006:006 And these words H1697, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, shall be in thine heart H3824:
006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently H8150 (8765) unto thy children H1121, and shalt talk H1696 (8765) of them when thou sittest H3427 (8800) in thine house H1004, and when thou walkest H3212 (8800) by the way H1870, and when thou liest down H7901 (8800), and when thou risest up H6965 (8800).
006:008 And thou shalt bind H7194 (8804) them for a sign H0226 upon thine hand H3027, and they shall be as frontlets H2903 between thine eyes H5869.
006:009 And thou shalt write H3789 (8804) them upon the posts H4201 of thy house H1004, and on thy gates H8179.
006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall have brought H0935 (8686) thee into the land H0776 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, to Abraham H0085, to Isaac H3327, and to Jacob H3290, to give H5414 (8800) thee great H1419 and goodly H2896 cities H5892, which thou buildedst H1129 (8804) not,
006:011 And houses H1004 full H4392 of all good H2898 [things], which thou filledst H4390 (8765) not, and wells H0953 digged H2672 (8803), which thou diggedst H2672 (8804) not, vineyards H3754 and olive trees H2132, which thou plantedst H5193 (8804) not; when thou shalt have eaten H0398 (8804) and be full H7646 (8804);
006:012 [Then] beware H8104 (8734) lest thou forget H7911 (8799) the LORD H3068, which brought thee forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the house H1004 of bondage H5650.
006:013 Thou shalt fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and serve H5647 (8799) him, and shalt swear H7650 (8735) by his name H8034.
006:014 Ye shall not go H3212 (8799) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, of the gods H0430 of the people H5971 which [are] round about H5439 you;
006:015 (For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] a jealous H7067 God H0410 among H7130 you) lest the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 be kindled H2734 (8799) against thee, and destroy H8045 (8689) thee from off the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
006:016 Ye shall not tempt H5254 (8762) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, as ye tempted H5254 (8765) [him] in Massah H4532.
006:017 Ye shall diligently H8104 (8800) keep H8104 (8799) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and his testimonies H5713, and his statutes H2706, which he hath commanded H6680 (8765) thee.
006:018 And thou shalt do H6213 (8804) [that which is] right H3477 and good H2896 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: that it may be well H3190 (8799) with thee, and that thou mayest go in H0935 (8804) and possess H3423 (8804) the good H2896 land H0776 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001,
006:019 To cast out H1920 (8800) all thine enemies H0341 (8802) from before H6440 thee, as the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765).
006:020 [And] when thy son H1121 asketh H7592 (8799) thee in time to come H4279, saying H0559 (8800), What [mean] the testimonies H5713, and the statutes H2706, and the judgments H4941, which the LORD H3068 our God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) you?
006:021 Then thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto thy son H1121, We were Pharaoh’s H6547 bondmen H5650 in Egypt H4714; and the LORD H3068 brought us out H3318 (8686) of Egypt H4714 with a mighty H2389 hand H3027:
006:022 And the LORD H3068 shewed H5414 (8799) signs H0226 and wonders H4159, great H1419 and sore H7451, upon Egypt H4714, upon Pharaoh H6547, and upon all his household H1004, before our eyes H5869:
006:023 And he brought us out H3318 (8689) from thence, that he might bring us in H0935 (8687), to give H5414 (8800) us the land H0776 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto our fathers H0001.
006:024 And the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8762) us to do H6213 (8800) all these statutes H2706, to fear H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068 our God H0430, for our good H2896 always H3117, that he might preserve us alive H2421 (8763), as [it is] at this day H3117.
006:025 And it shall be our righteousness H6666, if we observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) all these H2063 commandments H4687 before H6440 the LORD H3068 our God H0430, as he hath commanded H6680 (8765) us.
007:001 ¶ When the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall bring H0935 (8686) thee into the land H0776 whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it, and hath cast out H5394 (8804) many H7227 nations H1471 before H6440 thee, the Hittites H2850, and the Girgashites H1622, and the Amorites H0567, and the Canaanites H3669, and the Perizzites H6522, and the Hivites H2340, and the Jebusites H2983, seven H7651 nations H1471 greater H7227 and mightier H6099 than thou;
007:002 And when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall deliver H5414 (8804) them before H6440 thee; thou shalt smite H5221 (8689) them, [and] utterly H2763 (8687) destroy H2763 (8686) them; thou shalt make H3772 (8799) no covenant H1285 with them, nor shew mercy H2603 (8799) unto them:
007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages H2859 (8691) with them; thy daughter H1323 thou shalt not give H5414 (8799) unto his son H1121, nor his daughter H1323 shalt thou take H3947 (8799) unto thy son H1121.
007:004 For they will turn away H5493 (8686) thy son H1121 from following H0310 me, that they may serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430: so will the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 be kindled H2734 (8804) against you, and destroy H8045 (8689) thee suddenly H4118.
007:005 But thus shall ye deal H6213 (8799) with them; ye shall destroy H5422 (8799) their altars H4196, and break down H7665 (8762) their images H4676, and cut down H1438 (8762) their groves H0842, and burn H8313 (8799) their graven images H6456 with fire H0784.
007:006 For thou [art] an holy H6918 people H5971 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8804) thee to be a special H5459 people H5971 unto himself, above all people H5971 that [are] upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
007:007 The LORD H3068 did not set his love H2836 (8804) upon you, nor choose H0977 (8799) you, because ye were more H7230 in number than any people H5971; for ye [were] the fewest H4592 of all people H5971:
007:008 But because the LORD H3068 loved H0160 you, and because he would keep H8104 (8800) the oath H7621 which he had sworn H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001, hath the LORD H3068 brought you out H3318 (8689) with a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and redeemed H6299 (8799) you out of the house H1004 of bondmen H5650, from the hand H3027 of Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714.
007:009 Know H3045 (8804) therefore that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, he [is] God H0430, the faithful H0539 (8737) God H0410, which keepeth H8104 (8802) covenant H1285 and mercy H2617 with them that love H0157 (8802) him and keep H8104 (8802) his commandments H4687 to a thousand H0505 generations H1755;
007:010 And repayeth H7999 (8764) them that hate H8130 (8802) him to their face H6440, to destroy H0006 (8687) them: he will not be slack H0309 (8762) to him that hateth H8130 (8802) him, he will repay H7999 (8762) him to his face H6440.
007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep H8104 (8804) the commandments H4687, and the statutes H2706, and the judgments H4941, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, to do H6213 (8800) them.
007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if H6118 ye hearken H8085 (8799) to these judgments H4941, and keep H8104 (8804), and do H6213 (8804) them, that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall keep H8104 (8804) unto thee the covenant H1285 and the mercy H2617 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001:
007:013 And he will love H0157 (8804) thee, and bless H1288 (8765) thee, and multiply H7235 (8689) thee: he will also bless H1288 (8765) the fruit H6529 of thy womb H0990, and the fruit H6529 of thy land H0127, thy corn H1715, and thy wine H8492, and thine oil H3323, the increase H7698 of thy kine H0504, and the flocks H6251 of thy sheep H6629, in the land H0127 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) thee.
007:014 Thou shalt be blessed H1288 (8803) above all people H5971: there shall not be male H6135 or female barren H6135 among you, or among your cattle H0929.
007:015 And the LORD H3068 will take away H5493 (8689) from thee all sickness H2483, and will put H7760 (8799) none of the evil H7451 diseases H4064 of Egypt H4714, which thou knowest H3045 (8804), upon thee; but will lay H5414 (8804) them upon all [them] that hate H8130 (8802) thee.
007:016 And thou shalt consume H0398 (8804) all the people H5971 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall deliver H5414 (8802) thee; thine eye H5869 shall have no pity H2347 (8799) upon them: neither shalt thou serve H5647 (8799) their gods H0430; for that [will be] a snare H4170 unto thee.
007:017 If thou shalt say H0559 (8799) in thine heart H3824, These nations H1471 [are] more H7227 than I; how H0349 can H3201 (8799) I dispossess H3423 (8687) them?
007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid H3372 (8799) of them: [but] shalt well H2142 (8800) remember H2142 (8799) what the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 did H6213 (8804) unto Pharaoh H6547, and unto all Egypt H4714;
007:019 The great H1419 temptations H4531 which thine eyes H5869 saw H7200 (8804), and the signs H0226, and the wonders H4159, and the mighty H2389 hand H3027, and the stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, whereby the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 brought thee out H3318 (8689): so shall the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 do H6213 (8799) unto all the people H5971 of whom thou art afraid H3373 H6440.
007:020 Moreover the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will send H7971 (8762) the hornet H6880 among them, until they that are left H7604 (8737), and hide H5641 (8737) themselves from H6440 thee, be destroyed H0006 (8800).
007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted H6206 (8799) at H6440 them: for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] among H7130 you, a mighty H1419 God H0410 and terrible H3372 (8737).
007:022 And the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will put out H5394 (8804) those H0411 nations H1471 before H6440 thee by little H4592 and little H4592: thou mayest H3201 (8799) not consume H3615 (8763) them at once H4118, lest the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 increase H7235 (8799) upon thee.
007:023 But the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall deliver H5414 (8804) them unto thee H6440, and shall destroy H1949 (8804) them with a mighty H1419 destruction H4103, until they be destroyed H8045 (8736).
007:024 And he shall deliver H5414 (8804) their kings H4428 into thine hand H3027, and thou shalt destroy H0006 (8689) their name H8034 from under heaven H8064: there shall no man H0376 be able to stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 thee, until thou have destroyed H8045 (8687) them.
007:025 The graven images H6456 of their gods H0430 shall ye burn H8313 (8799) with fire H0784: thou shalt not desire H2530 (8799) the silver H3701 or gold H2091 [that is] on them, nor take H3947 (8804) [it] unto thee, lest thou be snared H3369 (8735) therein: for it [is] an abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
007:026 Neither shalt thou bring H0935 (8686) an abomination H8441 into thine house H1004, lest thou be a cursed thing H2764 like it: [but] thou shalt utterly H8262 (8763) detest H8262 (8762) it, and thou shalt utterly H8581 (8763) abhor H8581 (8762) it; for it [is] a cursed thing H2764.
008:001 ¶ All the commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117 shall ye observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800), that ye may live H2421 (8799), and multiply H7235 (8804), and go in H0935 (8804) and possess H3423 (8804) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001.
008:002 And thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) all the way H1870 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 led H3212 (8689) thee these forty H0705 years H8141 in the wilderness H4057, to humble H6031 (8763) thee, [and] to prove H5254 (8763) thee, to know H3045 (8800) what [was] in thine heart H3824, whether thou wouldest keep H8104 (8799) his commandments H4687, or no.
008:003 And he humbled H6031 (8762) thee, and suffered thee to hunger H7456 (8686), and fed H0398 (8686) thee with manna H4478, which thou knewest H3045 (8804) not, neither did thy fathers H0001 know H3045 (8804); that he might make thee know H3045 (8687) that man H0120 doth not live H2421 (8799) by bread H3899 only H0905, but by every [word] that proceedeth H4161 out of the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 doth man H0120 live H2421 (8799).
008:004 Thy raiment H8071 waxed not old H1086 (8804) upon thee, neither did thy foot H7272 swell H1216 (8804), these forty H0705 years H8141.
008:005 Thou shalt also consider H3045 (8804) in H5973 thine heart H3824, that, as a man H0376 chasteneth H3256 (8762) his son H1121, [so] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 chasteneth H3256 (8764) thee.
008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep H8104 (8804) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to walk H3212 (8800) in his ways H1870, and to fear H3372 (8800) him.
008:007 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 bringeth H0935 (8688) thee into a good H2896 land H0776, a land H0776 of brooks H5158 of water H4325, of fountains H5869 and depths H8415 that spring out H3318 (8802) of valleys H1237 and hills H2022;
008:008 A land H0776 of wheat H2406, and barley H8184, and vines H1612, and fig trees H8384, and pomegranates H7416; a land H0776 of oil H8081 olive H2132, and honey H1706;
008:009 A land H0776 wherein H0834 thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 without H3808 scarceness H4544, thou shalt not lack H2637 (8799) any [thing] in it; a land H0776 whose stones H0068 [are] iron H1270, and out of whose hills H2042 thou mayest dig H2672 (8799) brass H5178.
008:010 When thou hast eaten H0398 (8804) and art full H7646 (8804), then thou shalt bless H1288 (8765) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 for the good H2896 land H0776 which he hath given H5414 (8804) thee.
008:011 Beware H8104 (8734) that thou forget H7911 (8799) not the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, in not keeping H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687, and his judgments H4941, and his statutes H2708, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117:
008:012 Lest [when] thou hast eaten H0398 (8799) and art full H7646 (8804), and hast built H1129 (8799) goodly H2896 houses H1004, and dwelt H3427 (8804) [therein];
008:013 And [when] thy herds H1241 and thy flocks H6629 multiply H7235 (8799), and thy silver H3701 and thy gold H2091 is multiplied H7235 (8799), and all that thou hast is multiplied H7235 (8799);
008:014 Then thine heart H3824 be lifted up H7311 (8804), and thou forget H7911 (8804) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which brought thee forth H3318 (8688) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the house H1004 of bondage H5650;
008:015 Who led H3212 (8688) thee through that great H1419 and terrible H3372 (8737) wilderness H4057, [wherein were] fiery H8314 serpents H5175, and scorpions H6137, and drought H6774, where [there was] no water H4325; who brought thee forth H3318 (8688) water H4325 out of the rock H6697 of flint H2496;
008:016 Who fed H0398 (8688) thee in the wilderness H4057 with manna H4478, which thy fathers H0001 knew H3045 (8804) not, that he might humble H6031 (8763) thee, and that he might prove H5254 (8763) thee, to do thee good H3190 (8687) at thy latter end H0319;
008:017 And thou say H0559 (8804) in thine heart H3824, My power H3581 and the might H6108 of [mine] hand H3027 hath gotten H6213 (8804) me this wealth H2428.
008:018 But thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: for [it is] he that giveth H5414 (8802) thee power H3581 to get H6213 (8800) wealth H2428, that he may establish H6965 (8687) his covenant H1285 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, as [it is] this day H3117.
008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all H7911 (8800) forget H7911 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and walk H1980 (8804) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, and serve H5647 (8804) them, and worship H7812 (8694) them, I testify H5749 (8689) against you this day H3117 that ye shall surely H0006 (8800) perish H0006 (8799).
008:020 As the nations H1471 which the LORD H3068 destroyeth H0006 (8688) before your face H6440, so shall ye perish H0006 (8799); because H6118 ye would not be obedient H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
009:001 ¶ Hear H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478: Thou [art] to pass over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 this day H3117, to go in H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) nations H1471 greater H1419 and mightier H6099 than thyself, cities H5892 great H1419 and fenced up H1219 (8803) to heaven H8064,
009:002 A people H5971 great H1419 and tall H7311 (8802), the children H1121 of the Anakims H6062, whom thou knowest H3045 (8804), and [of whom] thou hast heard H8085 (8804) [say], Who can stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 the children H1121 of Anak H6061!
009:003 Understand H3045 (8804) therefore this day H3117, that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] he which goeth over H5674 (8802) before H6440 thee; [as] a consuming H0398 (8802) fire H0784 he shall destroy H8045 (8686) them, and he shall bring them down H3665 (8686) before thy face H6440: so shalt thou drive them out H3423 (8689), and destroy H0006 (8689) them quickly H4118, as the LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765) unto thee.
009:004 Speak H0559 (8799) not thou in thine heart H3824, after that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath cast them out H1920 (8800) from before H6440 thee, saying H0559 (8800), For my righteousness H6666 the LORD H3068 hath brought me in H0935 (8689) to possess H3423 (8800) this land H0776: but for the wickedness H7564 of these nations H1471 the LORD H3068 doth drive them out H3423 (8688) from before H6440 thee.
009:005 Not for thy righteousness H6666, or for the uprightness H3476 of thine heart H3824, dost thou go H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) their land H0776: but for the wickedness H7564 of these nations H1471 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 doth drive them out H3423 (8688) from before H6440 thee, and that he may perform H6965 (8687) the word H1697 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and Jacob H3290.
009:006 Understand H3045 (8804) therefore, that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee not this good H2896 land H0776 to possess H3423 (8800) it for thy righteousness H6666; for thou [art] a stiffnecked H6203 H7186 people H5971.
009:007 Remember H2142 (8798), [and] forget H7911 (8799) not, how thou provokedst the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 to wrath H7107 (8689) in the wilderness H4057: from H4480 the day H3117 that thou didst depart out H3318 (8804) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, until ye came H0935 (8800) unto this place H4725, ye have been rebellious H4784 (8688) against H5973 the LORD H3068.
009:008 Also in Horeb H2722 ye provoked H7107 the LORD H3068 to wrath H7107 (8689), so that the LORD H3068 was angry H0599 (8691) with you to have destroyed H8045 (8687) you.
009:009 When I was gone up H5927 (8800) into the mount H2022 to receive H3947 (8800) the tables H3871 of stone H0068, [even] the tables H3871 of the covenant H1285 which the LORD H3068 made H3772 (8804) with you, then I abode H3427 (8799) in the mount H2022 forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915, I neither did eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899 nor drink H8354 (8804) water H4325:
009:010 And the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) unto me two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068 written H3789 (8803) with the finger H0676 of God H0430; and on them [was written] according to all the words H1697, which the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) with you in the mount H2022 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784 in the day H3117 of the assembly H6951.
009:011 And it came to pass at the end H7093 of forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915, [that] the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804) me the two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068, [even] the tables H3871 of the covenant H1285.
009:012 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Arise H6965 (8798), get thee down H3381 (8798) quickly H4118 from hence; for thy people H5971 which thou hast brought forth H3318 (8689) out of Egypt H4714 have corrupted H7843 (8765) [themselves]; they are quickly H4118 turned aside H5493 (8804) out of the way H1870 which I commanded H6680 (8765) them; they have made H6213 (8804) them a molten image H4541.
009:013 Furthermore the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto me, saying H0559 (8800), I have seen H7200 (8804) this people H5971, and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked H6203 H7186 people H5971:
009:014 Let me alone H7503 (8685), that I may destroy H8045 (8686) them, and blot out H4229 (8799) their name H8034 from under heaven H8064: and I will make H6213 (8799) of H0854 thee a nation H1471 mightier H6099 and greater H7227 than they.
009:015 So I turned H6437 (8799) and came down H3381 (8799) from the mount H2022, and the mount H2022 burned H1197 (8802) with fire H0784: and the two H8147 tables H3871 of the covenant H1285 [were] in my two H8147 hands H3027.
009:016 And I looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, ye had sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 your God H0430, [and] had made H6213 (8804) you a molten H4541 calf H5695: ye had turned aside H5493 (8804) quickly H4118 out of the way H1870 which the LORD H3068 had commanded H6680 (8765) you.
009:017 And I took H8610 (8799) the two H8147 tables H3871, and cast H7993 (8686) them out of H5921 my two H8147 hands H3027, and brake H7665 (8762) them before your eyes H5869.
009:018 And I fell down H5307 (8691) before H6440 the LORD H3068, as at the first H7223, forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915: I did neither eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899, nor drink H8354 (8804) water H4325, because of all your sins H2403 which ye sinned H2398 (8804), in doing H6213 (8800) wickedly H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, to provoke him to anger H3707 (8687).
009:019 For I was afraid H3025 (8804) of H6440 the anger H0639 and hot displeasure H2534, wherewith the LORD H3068 was wroth H7107 (8804) against you to destroy H8045 (8687) you. But the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto me at that time H6471 also.
009:020 And the LORD H3068 was very H3966 angry H0599 (8694) with Aaron H0175 to have destroyed H8045 (8687) him: and I prayed H6419 (8691) for Aaron H0175 also the same time H6256.
009:021 And I took H3947 (8804) your sin H2403, the calf H5695 which ye had made H6213 (8804), and burnt H8313 (8799) it with fire H0784, and stamped H3807 (8799) it, [and] ground H2912 (8800) [it] very small H3190 (8687), [even] until it was as small H1854 (8804) as dust H6083: and I cast H7993 (8686) the dust H6083 thereof into the brook H5158 that descended out H3381 (8802) of the mount H2022.
009:022 And at Taberah H8404, and at Massah H4532, and at Kibrothhattaavah H6914, ye provoked the LORD H3068 to wrath H7107 (8688).
009:023 Likewise when the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8800) you from Kadeshbarnea H6947, saying H0559 (8800), Go up H5927 (8798) and possess H3423 (8798) the land H0776 which I have given H5414 (8804) you; then ye rebelled H4784 (8686) against the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and ye believed H0539 (8689) him not, nor hearkened H8085 (8804) to his voice H6963.
009:024 Ye have been rebellious H4784 (8688) against the LORD H3068 from the day H3117 that I knew H3045 (8800) you.
009:025 Thus I fell down H5307 (8691) before H6440 the LORD H3068 forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915, as I fell down H5307 (8694) [at the first]; because the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8804) he would destroy H8045 (8687) you.
009:026 I prayed H6419 (8691) therefore unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, destroy H7843 (8686) not thy people H5971 and thine inheritance H5159, which thou hast redeemed H6299 (8804) through thy greatness H1433, which thou hast brought forth H3318 (8689) out of Egypt H4714 with a mighty H2389 hand H3027.
009:027 Remember H2142 (8798) thy servants H5650, Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and Jacob H3290; look H6437 (8799) not unto the stubbornness H7190 of this people H5971, nor to their wickedness H7562, nor to their sin H2403:
009:028 Lest the land H0776 whence thou broughtest us out H3318 (8689) say H0559 (8799), Because the LORD H3068 was not able H3201 (8800) to bring H0935 (8687) them into the land H0776 which he promised H1696 (8765) them, and because he hated H8135 them, he hath brought them out H3318 (8689) to slay H4191 (8687) them in the wilderness H4057.
009:029 Yet they [are] thy people H5971 and thine inheritance H5159, which thou broughtest out H3318 (8689) by thy mighty H1419 power H3581 and by thy stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220.
010:001 ¶ At that time H6256 the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Hew H6458 (8798) thee two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068 like unto the first H7223, and come up H5927 (8798) unto me into the mount H2022, and make H6213 (8804) thee an ark H0727 of wood H6086.
010:002 And I will write H3789 (8799) on the tables H3871 the words H1697 that were in the first H7223 tables H3871 which thou brakest H7665 (8765), and thou shalt put H7760 (8804) them in the ark H0727.
010:003 And I made H6213 (8799) an ark H0727 [of] shittim H7848 wood H6086, and hewed H6458 (8799) two H8147 tables H3871 of stone H0068 like unto the first H7223, and went up H5927 (8799) into the mount H2022, having the two H8147 tables H3871 in mine hand H3027.
010:004 And he wrote H3789 (8799) on the tables H3871, according to the first H7223 writing H4385, the ten H6235 commandments H1697, which the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) unto you in the mount H2022 out of the midst H8432 of the fire H0784 in the day H3117 of the assembly H6951: and the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8799) them unto me.
010:005 And I turned H6437 (8799) myself and came down H3381 (8799) from the mount H2022, and put H7760 (8799) the tables H3871 in the ark H0727 which I had made H6213 (8804); and there they be, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) me.
010:006 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 took their journey H5265 (8804) from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan H0885 to Mosera H4149: there Aaron H0175 died H4191 (8804), and there he was buried H6912 (8735); and Eleazar H0499 his son H1121 ministered in the priest’s office H3547 (8762) in his stead.
010:007 From thence they journeyed H5265 (8804) unto Gudgodah H1412; and from Gudgodah H1412 to Jotbath H3193, a land H0776 of rivers H5158 of waters H4325.
010:008 At that time H6256 the LORD H3068 separated H0914 (8689) the tribe H7626 of Levi H3878, to bear H5375 (8800) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, to stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 the LORD H3068 to minister H8334 (8763) unto him, and to bless H1288 (8763) in his name H8034, unto this day H3117.
010:009 Wherefore Levi H3878 hath no part H2506 nor inheritance H5159 with his brethren H0251; the LORD H3068 [is] his inheritance H5159, according as the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 promised H1696 (8765) him.
010:010 And I stayed H5975 (8804) in the mount H2022, according to the first H7223 time H3117, forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915; and the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto me at that time H6471 also, [and] the LORD H3068 would H0014 (8804) not destroy H7843 (8687) thee.
010:011 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Arise H6965 (8798), take H3212 (8798) [thy] journey H4550 before H6440 the people H5971, that they may go in H0935 (8799) and possess H3423 (8799) the land H0776, which I sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) unto them.
010:012 And now, Israel H3478, what doth the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 require H7592 (8802) of thee, but to fear H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to walk H3212 (8800) in all his ways H1870, and to love H0157 (8800) him, and to serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with all thy heart H3824 and with all thy soul H5315,
010:013 To keep H8104 (8800) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068, and his statutes H2708, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117 for thy good H2896?
010:014 Behold, the heaven H8064 and the heaven H8064 of heavens H8064 [is] the LORD’S H3068 thy God H0430, the earth H0776 [also], with all that therein [is].
010:015 Only the LORD H3068 had a delight H2836 (8804) in thy fathers H0001 to love H0157 (8800) them, and he chose H0977 (8799) their seed H2233 after H0310 them, [even] you above all people H5971, as [it is] this day H3117.
010:016 Circumcise H4135 (8804) therefore the foreskin H6190 of your heart H3824, and be no more stiffnecked H6203 H7185 (8686).
010:017 For the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [is] God H0430 of gods H0430, and Lord H0113 of lords H0113, a great H1419 God H0410, a mighty H1368, and a terrible H3372 (8737), which regardeth H5375 (8799) not persons H6440, nor taketh H3947 (8799) reward H7810:
010:018 He doth execute H6213 (8802) the judgment H4941 of the fatherless H3490 and widow H0490, and loveth H0157 (8802) the stranger H1616, in giving H5414 (8800) him food H3899 and raiment H8071.
010:019 Love H0157 (8804) ye therefore the stranger H1616: for ye were strangers H1616 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
010:020 Thou shalt fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430; him shalt thou serve H5647 (8799), and to him shalt thou cleave H1692 (8799), and swear H7650 (8735) by his name H8034.
010:021 He [is] thy praise H8416, and he [is] thy God H0430, that hath done H6213 (8804) for thee these great H1419 and terrible things H3372 (8737), which thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804).
010:022 Thy fathers H0001 went down H3381 (8804) into Egypt H4714 with threescore and ten H7657 persons H5315; and now the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath made H7760 (8804) thee as the stars H3556 of heaven H8064 for multitude H7230.
011:001 ¶ Therefore thou shalt love H0157 (8804) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and keep H8104 (8804) his charge H4931, and his statutes H2708, and his judgments H4941, and his commandments H4687, alway H3117.
011:002 And know H3045 (8804) ye this day H3117: for [I speak] not with your children H1121 which have not known H3045 (8804), and which have not seen H7200 (8804) the chastisement H4148 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, his greatness H1433, his mighty H2389 hand H3027, and his stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220,
011:003 And his miracles H0226, and his acts H4639, which he did H6213 (8804) in the midst H8432 of Egypt H4714 unto Pharaoh H6547 the king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and unto all his land H0776;
011:004 And what he did H6213 (8804) unto the army H2428 of Egypt H4714, unto their horses H5483, and to their chariots H7393; how he made the water H4325 of the Red H5488 sea H3220 to overflow H6687 (8689) them H6440 as they pursued H7291 (8800) after H0310 you, and [how] the LORD H3068 hath destroyed H0006 (8762) them unto this day H3117;
011:005 And what he did H6213 (8804) unto you in the wilderness H4057, until ye came H0935 (8800) into this place H4725;
011:006 And what he did H6213 (8804) unto Dathan H1885 and Abiram H0048, the sons H1121 of Eliab H0446, the son H1121 of Reuben H7205: how the earth H0776 opened H6475 (8804) her mouth H6310, and swallowed them up H1104 (8799), and their households H1004, and their tents H0168, and all the substance H3351 that [was] in their possession H7272, in the midst H7130 of all Israel H3478:
011:007 But your eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8802) all the great H1419 acts H4639 of the LORD H3068 which he did H6213 (8804).
011:008 Therefore shall ye keep H8104 (8804) all the commandments H4687 which H0834 I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117, that ye may be strong H2388 (8799), and go in H0935 (8804) and possess H3423 (8804) the land H0776, whither ye go H5674 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it;
011:009 And that ye may prolong H0748 (8686) [your] days H3117 in the land H0127, which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) unto them and to their seed H2233, a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
011:010 For the land H0776, whither thou goest in H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it, [is] not as the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from whence ye came out H3318 (8804), where thou sowedst H2232 (8799) thy seed H2233, and wateredst H8248 (8689) [it] with thy foot H7272, as a garden H1588 of herbs H3419:
011:011 But the land H0776, whither ye go H5674 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it, [is] a land H0776 of hills H2022 and valleys H1237, [and] drinketh H8354 (8799) water H4325 of the rain H4306 of heaven H8064:
011:012 A land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 careth for H1875 (8802): the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [are] always H8548 upon it, from the beginning H7225 of the year H8141 even unto the end H0319 of the year H8141.
011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken H8085 (8799) diligently H8085 (8800) unto my commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117, to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and to serve H5647 (8800) him with all your heart H3824 and with all your soul H5315,
011:014 That I will give H5414 (8804) [you] the rain H4306 of your land H0776 in his due season H6256, the first rain H3138 and the latter rain H4456, that thou mayest gather H0622 (8804) in thy corn H1715, and thy wine H8492, and thine oil H3323.
011:015 And I will send H5414 (8804) grass H6212 in thy fields H7704 for thy cattle H0929, that thou mayest eat H0398 (8804) and be full H7646 (8804).
011:016 Take heed H8104 (8734) to yourselves, that your heart H3824 be not deceived H6601 (8799), and ye turn aside H5493 (8804), and serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430, and worship H7812 (8694) them;
011:017 And [then] the LORD’S H3068 wrath H0639 be kindled H2734 (8804) against you, and he shut up H6113 (8804) the heaven H8064, that there be no rain H4306, and that the land H0127 yield H5414 (8799) not her fruit H2981; and [lest] ye perish H0006 (8804) quickly H4120 from off the good H2896 land H0776 which the LORD H3068 giveth H5414 (8802) you.
011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up H7760 (8804) these my words H1697 in your heart H3824 and in your soul H5315, and bind H7194 (8804) them for a sign H0226 upon your hand H3027, that they may be as frontlets H2903 between your eyes H5869.
011:019 And ye shall teach H3925 (8765) them your children H1121, speaking H1696 (8763) of them when thou sittest H3427 (8800) in thine house H1004, and when thou walkest H3212 (8800) by the way H1870, when thou liest H7901 (8800) down, and when thou risest up H6965 (8800).
011:020 And thou shalt write H3789 (8804) them upon the door posts H4201 of thine house H1004, and upon thy gates H8179:
011:021 That your days H3117 may be multiplied H7235 (8799), and the days H3117 of your children H1121, in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) them, as the days H3117 of heaven H8064 upon the earth H0776.
011:022 For if ye shall diligently H8104 (8800) keep H8104 (8799) all these commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) you, to do H6213 (8800) them, to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, to walk H3212 (8800) in all his ways H1870, and to cleave H1692 (8800) unto him;
011:023 Then will the LORD H3068 drive out H3423 (8689) all these nations H1471 from before H6440 you, and ye shall possess H3423 (8804) greater H1419 nations H1471 and mightier H6099 than yourselves.
011:024 Every place H4725 whereon the soles H3709 of your feet H7272 shall tread H1869 (8799) shall be yours: from the wilderness H4057 and Lebanon H3844, from the river H5104, the river H5104 Euphrates H6578, even unto the uttermost H0314 sea H3220 shall your coast H1366 be.
011:025 There shall no man H0376 be able to stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 you: [for] the LORD H3068 your God H0430 shall lay H5414 (8799) the fear H6343 of you and the dread H4172 of you upon H6440 all the land H0776 that ye shall tread H1869 (8799) upon, as he hath said H1696 (8765) unto you.
011:026 Behold H7200 (8798), I set H5414 (8802) before H6440 you this day H3117 a blessing H1293 and a curse H7045;
011:027 A blessing H1293, if ye obey H8085 (8799) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117:
011:028 And a curse H7045, if ye will not obey H8085 (8799) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, but turn aside H5493 (8804) out of the way H1870 which I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117, to go H3212 (8800) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, which ye have not known H3045 (8804).
011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath brought thee in H0935 (8686) unto the land H0776 whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it, that thou shalt put H5414 (8804) the blessing H1293 upon mount H2022 Gerizim H1630, and the curse H7045 upon mount H2022 Ebal H5858.
011:030 [Are] they not on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383, by H0310 the way H1870 where the sun H8121 goeth down H3996, in the land H0776 of the Canaanites H3669, which dwell H3427 (8802) in the champaign H6160 over against H4136 Gilgal H1537, beside H0681 the plains H0436 of Moreh H4176?
011:031 For ye shall pass over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 to go in H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) you, and ye shall possess H3423 (8804) it, and dwell H3427 (8804) therein.
011:032 And ye shall observe H8104 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) all the statutes H2706 and judgments H4941 which I set H5414 (8802) before H6440 you this day H3117.
012:001 ¶ These [are] the statutes H2706 and judgments H4941, which ye shall observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) in the land H0776, which the LORD H3068 God H0430 of thy fathers H0001 giveth H5414 (8804) thee to possess H3423 (8800) it, all the days H3117 that ye live H2416 upon the earth H0127.
012:002 Ye shall utterly H0006 (8763) destroy H0006 (8762) all the places H4725, wherein the nations H1471 which H0834 ye shall possess H3423 (8802) served H5647 (8804) their gods H0430, upon the high H7311 (8802) mountains H2022, and upon the hills H1389, and under every green H7488 tree H6086:
012:003 And ye shall overthrow H5422 (8765) their altars H4196, and break H7665 (8765) their pillars H4676, and burn H8313 (8799) their groves H0842 with fire H0784; and ye shall hew down H1438 (8762) the graven images H6456 of their gods H0430, and destroy H0006 (8765) the names H8034 of them out of that place H4725.
012:004 Ye shall not do so H6213 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
012:005 But unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799) out of all your tribes H7626 to put H7760 (8800) his name H8034 there, [even] unto his habitation H7933 shall ye seek H1875 (8799), and thither thou shalt come H0935 (8804):
012:006 And thither ye shall bring H0935 (8689) your burnt offerings H5930, and your sacrifices H2077, and your tithes H4643, and heave offerings H8641 of your hand H3027, and your vows H5088, and your freewill offerings H5071, and the firstlings H1062 of your herds H1241 and of your flocks H6629:
012:007 And there ye shall eat H0398 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and ye shall rejoice H8055 (8804) in all that ye put H4916 your hand H3027 unto, ye and your households H1004, wherein the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8765) thee.
012:008 Ye shall not do H6213 (8799) after all [the things] that we do H6213 (8802) here this day H3117, every man H0376 whatsoever [is] right H3477 in his own eyes H5869.
012:009 For ye are not as yet come H0935 (8804) to the rest H4496 and to the inheritance H5159, which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) you.
012:010 But [when] ye go over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383, and dwell H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 giveth you to inherit H5157 (8688), and [when] he giveth you rest H5117 (8689) from all your enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439, so that ye dwell H3427 (8804) in safety H0983;
012:011 Then there shall be a place H4725 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799) to cause his name H8034 to dwell H7931 (8763) there; thither shall ye bring H0935 (8686) all that I command H6680 (8764) you; your burnt offerings H5930, and your sacrifices H2077, your tithes H4643, and the heave offering H8641 of your hand H3027, and all your choice H4005 vows H5088 which ye vow H5087 (8799) unto the LORD H3068:
012:012 And ye shall rejoice H8055 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430, ye, and your sons H1121, and your daughters H1323, and your menservants H5650, and your maidservants H0519, and the Levite H3881 that [is] within your gates H8179; forasmuch H3588 as he hath no part H2506 nor inheritance H5159 with you.
012:013 Take heed H8104 (8734) to thyself that thou offer H5927 (8686) not thy burnt offerings H5930 in every place H4725 that thou seest H7200 (8799):
012:014 But in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799) in one H0259 of thy tribes H7626, there thou shalt offer H5927 (8686) thy burnt offerings H5930, and there thou shalt do H6213 (8799) all that I command H6680 (8764) thee.
012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill H2076 (8799) and eat H0398 (8804) flesh H1320 in all thy gates H8179, whatsoever thy soul H5315 lusteth after H0185, according to the blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 which he hath given H5414 (8804) thee: the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889 may eat H0398 (8799) thereof, as of the roebuck H6643, and as of the hart H0354.
012:016 Only ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) the blood H1818; ye shall pour H8210 (8799) it upon the earth H0776 as water H4325.
012:017 Thou mayest H3201 (8799) not eat H0398 (8800) within thy gates H8179 the tithe H4643 of thy corn H1715, or of thy wine H8492, or of thy oil H3323, or the firstlings H1062 of thy herds H1241 or of thy flock H6629, nor any of thy vows H5088 which thou vowest H5087 (8799), nor thy freewill offerings H5071, or heave offering H8641 of thine hand H3027:
012:018 But thou must eat H0398 (8799) them before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799), thou, and thy son H1121, and thy daughter H1323, and thy manservant H5650, and thy maidservant H0519, and the Levite H3881 that [is] within thy gates H8179: and thou shalt rejoice H8055 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in all that thou puttest H4916 thine hands H3027 unto.
012:019 Take heed H8104 (8734) to thyself that thou forsake H5800 (8799) not the Levite H3881 as long as thou livest H3117 upon the earth H0127.
012:020 When the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall enlarge H7337 (8686) thy border H1366, as he hath promised H1696 (8765) thee, and thou shalt say H0559 (8804), I will eat H0398 (8799) flesh H1320, because thy soul H5315 longeth H0183 (8762) to eat H0398 (8800) flesh H1320; thou mayest eat H0398 (8799) flesh H1320, whatsoever thy soul H5315 lusteth after H0185.
012:021 If the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8799) to put H7760 (8800) his name H8034 there be too far H7368 (8799) from thee, then thou shalt kill H2076 (8804) of thy herd H1241 and of thy flock H6629, which the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) thee, as I have commanded H6680 (8765) thee, and thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) in thy gates H8179 whatsoever thy soul H5315 lusteth after H0185.
012:022 Even as the roebuck H6643 and the hart H0354 is eaten H0398 (8735), so thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) them: the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889 shall eat H0398 (8799) [of] them alike H3162.
012:023 Only be sure H2388 (8798) that thou eat H0398 (8800) not the blood H1818: for the blood H1818 [is] the life H5315; and thou mayest not eat H0398 (8799) the life H5315 with the flesh H1320.
012:024 Thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) it; thou shalt pour H8210 (8799) it upon the earth H0776 as water H4325.
012:025 Thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) it; that it may go well H3190 (8799) with thee, and with thy children H1121 after H0310 thee, when thou shalt do H6213 (8799) [that which is] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
012:026 Only thy holy things H6944 which thou hast, and thy vows H5088, thou shalt take H5375 (8799), and go H0935 (8804) unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799):
012:027 And thou shalt offer H6213 (8804) thy burnt offerings H5930, the flesh H1320 and the blood H1818, upon the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: and the blood H1818 of thy sacrifices H2077 shall be poured out H8210 (8735) upon the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) the flesh H1320.
012:028 Observe H8104 (8798) and hear H8085 (8804) all these words H1697 which I command H6680 (8764) thee, that it may go well H3190 (8799) with thee, and with thy children H1121 after H0310 thee for H5704 ever H5769, when thou doest H6213 (8799) [that which is] good H2896 and right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
012:029 When the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall cut off H3772 (8686) the nations H1471 from before H6440 thee, whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) them, and thou succeedest H3423 (8804) them, and dwellest H3427 (8804) in their land H0776;
012:030 Take heed H8104 (8734) to thyself that thou be not snared H5367 (8735) by following H0310 them, after H0310 that they be destroyed H8045 (8736) from before H6440 thee; and that thou enquire H1875 (8799) not after their gods H0430, saying H0559 (8800), How did these nations H1471 serve H5647 (8799) their gods H0430? even so will I do H6213 (8799) likewise H1571.
012:031 Thou shalt not do H6213 (8799) so unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: for every abomination H8441 to the LORD H3068, which he hateth H8130 (8804), have they done H6213 (8804) unto their gods H0430; for even their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 they have burnt H8313 (8799) in the fire H0784 to their gods H0430.
012:032 What thing H1697 soever I command H6680 (8764) you, observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) it: thou shalt not add H3254 (8686) thereto, nor diminish H1639 (8799) from it.
013:001 ¶ If there arise H6965 (8799) among H7130 you a prophet H5030, or a dreamer H2492 (8802) of dreams H2472, and giveth H5414 (8804) thee a sign H0226 or a wonder H4159,
013:002 And the sign H0226 or the wonder H4159 come to pass H0935 (8804), whereof he spake H1696 (8765) unto thee, saying H0559 (8800), Let us go H3212 (8799) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, which thou hast not known H3045 (8804), and let us serve H5647 (8714) them;
013:003 Thou shalt not hearken H8085 (8799) unto the words H1697 of that prophet H5030, or that dreamer H2492 (8802) of dreams H2472: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 proveth H5254 (8764) you, to know H3045 (8800) whether ye H3426 love H0157 (8802) the LORD H3068 your God H0430 with all your heart H3824 and with all your soul H5315.
013:004 Ye shall walk H3212 (8799) after H0310 the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and fear H3372 (8799) him, and keep H8104 (8799) his commandments H4687, and obey H8085 (8799) his voice H6963, and ye shall serve H5647 (8799) him, and cleave H1692 (8799) unto him.
013:005 And that prophet H5030, or that dreamer H2492 (8802) of dreams H2472, shall be put to death H4191 (8714); because he hath spoken H1696 (8765) to turn H5627 [you] away from the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which brought you out H3318 (8688) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and redeemed H6299 (8802) you out of the house H1004 of bondage H5650, to thrust H5080 (8687) thee out of the way H1870 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) thee to walk in H3212 (8800). So shalt thou put H1197 the evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from the midst H7130 of thee.
013:006 If thy brother H0251, the son H1121 of thy mother H0517, or thy son H1121, or thy daughter H1323, or the wife H0802 of thy bosom H2436, or thy friend H7453, which [is] as thine own soul H5315, entice H5496 (8686) thee secretly H5643, saying H0559 (8800), Let us go H3212 (8799) and serve H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, which thou hast not known H3045 (8804), thou, nor thy fathers H0001;
013:007 [Namely], of the gods H0430 of the people H5971 which [are] round about H5439 you, nigh H7138 unto thee, or far off H7350 from thee, from the [one] end H7097 of the earth H0776 even unto the [other] end H7097 of the earth H0776;
013:008 Thou shalt not consent H0014 (8799) unto him, nor hearken H8085 (8799) unto him; neither shall thine eye H5869 pity H2347 (8799) him, neither shalt thou spare H2550 (8799), neither shalt thou conceal H3680 (8762) him:
013:009 But thou shalt surely H2026 (8800) kill H2026 (8799) him; thine hand H3027 shall be first H7223 upon him to put him to death H4191 (8687), and afterwards H0314 the hand H3027 of all the people H5971.
013:010 And thou shalt stone H5619 (8804) him with stones H0068, that he die H4191 (8804); because he hath sought H1245 (8765) to thrust thee away H5080 (8687) from the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which brought thee out H3318 (8688) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the house H1004 of bondage H5650.
013:011 And all Israel H3478 shall hear H8085 (8799), and fear H3372 (8799), and shall do H6213 (8800) no more H3254 (8686) any H1697 such wickedness H7451 as this is among H7130 you.
013:012 If thou shalt hear H8085 (8799) [say] in one H0259 of thy cities H5892, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given H5414 (8802) thee to dwell H3427 (8800) there, saying H0559 (8800),
013:013 [Certain] men H0582, the children H1121 of Belial H1100, are gone out H3318 (8804) from among H7130 you, and have withdrawn H5080 (8686) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of their city H5892, saying H0559 (8800), Let us go H3212 (8799) and serve H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, which ye have not known H3045 (8804);
013:014 Then shalt thou enquire H1875 (8804), and make search H2713 (8804), and ask H7592 (8804) diligently H3190 (8687); and, behold, [if it be] truth H0571, [and] the thing H1697 certain H3559 (8737), [that] such H2063 abomination H8441 is wrought H6213 (8738) among H7130 you;
013:015 Thou shalt surely H5221 (8687) smite H5221 (8686) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of that city H5892 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, destroying it utterly H2763 (8685), and all that [is] therein, and the cattle H0929 thereof, with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
013:016 And thou shalt gather H6908 (8799) all the spoil H7998 of it into the midst H8432 of the street H7339 thereof, and shalt burn H8313 (8804) with fire H0784 the city H5892, and all the spoil H7998 thereof every whit H3632, for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: and it shall be an heap H8510 for ever H5769; it shall not be built again H1129 (8735).
013:017 And there shall cleave H1692 (8799) nought H3972 of the cursed thing H2764 to thine hand H3027: that the LORD H3068 may turn H7725 (8799) from the fierceness H2740 of his anger H0639, and shew H5414 (8804) thee mercy H7356, and have compassion H7355 (8765) upon thee, and multiply H7235 (8689) thee, as he hath sworn H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001;
013:018 When thou shalt hearken H8085 (8799) to the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to keep H8104 (8800) all his commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, to do H6213 (8800) [that which is] right H3477 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
014:001 ¶ Ye [are] the children H1121 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430: ye shall not cut H1413 (8704) yourselves, nor make H7760 (8799) any baldness H7144 between your eyes H5869 for the dead H4191 (8801).
014:002 For thou [art] an holy H6918 people H5971 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804) thee to be a peculiar H5459 people H5971 unto himself, above all the nations H5971 that [are] upon H6440 the earth H0127.
014:003 Thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) any abominable thing H8441.
014:004 These [are] the beasts H0929 which ye shall eat H0398 (8799): the ox H7794, the sheep H7716 H3775, and the goat H5795,
014:005 The hart H0354, and the roebuck H6643, and the fallow deer H3180, and the wild goat H0689, and the pygarg H1788, and the wild ox H8377, and the chamois H2169.
014:006 And every beast H0929 that parteth H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541, and cleaveth H8157 the cleft H8156 (8802) into two H8147 claws H6541, [and] cheweth H5927 (8688) the cud H1625 among the beasts H0929, that ye shall eat H0398 (8799).
014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) of them that chew H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, or of them that divide H6536 (8688) the cloven H8156 (8803) hoof H6541; [as] the camel H1581, and the hare H0768, and the coney H8227: for they chew H5927 (8688) the cud H1625, but divide H6536 (8689) not the hoof H6541; [therefore] they [are] unclean H2931 unto you.
014:008 And the swine H2386, because it divideth H6536 (8688) the hoof H6541, yet cheweth not the cud H1625, it [is] unclean H2931 unto you: ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) of their flesh H1320, nor touch H5060 (8799) their dead carcase H5038.
014:009 These ye shall eat H0398 (8799) of all that [are] in the waters H4325: all that have fins H5579 and scales H7193 shall ye eat H0398 (8799):
014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins H5579 and scales H7193 ye may not eat H0398 (8799); it [is] unclean H2931 unto you.
014:011 [Of] all clean H2889 birds H6833 ye shall eat H0398 (8799).
014:012 But these [are they] of which ye shall not eat H0398 (8799): the eagle H5404, and the ossifrage H6538, and the ospray H5822,
014:013 And the glede H7201, and the kite H0344, and the vulture H1772 after his kind H4327,
014:014 And every raven H6158 after his kind H4327,
014:015 And the owl H1323 H3284, and the night hawk H8464, and the cuckow H7828, and the hawk H5322 after his kind H4327,
014:016 The little owl H3563, and the great owl H3244, and the swan H8580,
014:017 And the pelican H6893, and the gier eagle H7360, and the cormorant H7994,
014:018 And the stork H2624, and the heron H0601 after her kind H4327, and the lapwing H1744, and the bat H5847.
014:019 And every creeping thing H8318 that flieth H5775 [is] unclean H2931 unto you: they shall not be eaten H0398 (8735).
014:020 [But of] all clean H2889 fowls H5775 ye may eat H0398 (8799).
014:021 Ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) [of] any thing that dieth of itself H5038: thou shalt give H5414 (8799) it unto the stranger H1616 that [is] in thy gates H8179, that he may eat H0398 (8804) it; or thou mayest sell H4376 (8800) it unto an alien H5237: for thou [art] an holy H6918 people H5971 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430. Thou shalt not seethe H1310 (8762) a kid H1423 in his mother’s H0517 milk H2461.
014:022 Thou shalt truly H6237 (8763) tithe H6237 (8762) all the increase H8393 of thy seed H2233, that the field H7704 bringeth forth H3318 (8802) year H8141 by year H8141.
014:023 And thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, in the place H4725 which he shall choose H0977 (8799) to place H7931 (8763) his name H8034 there, the tithe H4643 of thy corn H1715, of thy wine H8492, and of thine oil H3323, and the firstlings H1062 of thy herds H1241 and of thy flocks H6629; that thou mayest learn H3925 (8799) to fear H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 always H3117.
014:024 And if the way H1870 be too long H7235 (8799) for thee, so that H3588 thou art not able H3201 (8799) to carry H5375 (8800) it; [or] if the place H4725 be too far H7368 (8799) from thee, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799) to set H7760 (8800) his name H8034 there, when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8762) thee:
014:025 Then shalt thou turn H5414 (8804) [it] into money H3701, and bind up H6696 (8804) the money H3701 in thine hand H3027, and shalt go H1980 (8804) unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799):
014:026 And thou shalt bestow H5414 (8804) that money H3701 for whatsoever thy soul H5315 lusteth after H0183 (8762), for oxen H1241, or for sheep H6629, or for wine H3196, or for strong drink H7941, or for whatsoever thy soul H5315 desireth H7592 (8799): and thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) there before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and thou shalt rejoice H8055 (8804), thou, and thine household H1004,
014:027 And the Levite H3881 that [is] within thy gates H8179; thou shalt not forsake H5800 (8799) him; for he hath no part H2506 nor inheritance H5159 with thee.
014:028 At the end H7097 of three H7969 years H8141 thou shalt bring forth H3318 (8686) all the tithe H4643 of thine increase H8393 the same year H8141, and shalt lay [it] up H3240 (8689) within thy gates H8179:
014:029 And the Levite H3881, (because he hath no part H2506 nor inheritance H5159 with thee,) and the stranger H1616, and the fatherless H3490, and the widow H0490, which [are] within thy gates H8179, shall come H0935 (8804), and shall eat H0398 (8804) and be satisfied H7646 (8804); that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 may bless H1288 (8762) thee in all the work H4639 of thine hand H3027 which thou doest H6213 (8799).
015:001 ¶ At the end H7093 of [every] seven H7651 years H8141 thou shalt make H6213 (8799) a release H8059.
015:002 And this [is] the manner H1697 of the release H8059: Every creditor H1167 H4874 H3027 that lendeth H5383 (8686) [ought] unto his neighbour H7453 shall release H8058 (8800) [it]; he shall not exact H5065 (8799) [it] of his neighbour H7453, or of his brother H0251; because it is called H7121 (8804) the LORD’S H3068 release H8059.
015:003 Of a foreigner H5237 thou mayest exact H5065 (8799) [it again]: but [that] which is thine with thy brother H0251 thine hand H3027 shall release H8058 (8686);
015:004 Save H0657 when there shall be no poor H0034 among you; for the LORD H3068 shall greatly H1288 (8763) bless H1288 (8762) thee in the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159 to possess H3423 (8800) it:
015:005 Only if thou carefully H8085 (8800) hearken H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to observe H8104 (8800) to do H6213 (8800) all these commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117.
015:006 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 blesseth H1288 (8765) thee, as he promised H1696 (8765) thee: and thou shalt lend H5670 (8689) unto many H7227 nations H1471, but thou shalt not borrow H5670 (8799); and thou shalt reign H4910 (8804) over many H7227 nations H1471, but they shall not reign H4910 (8799) over thee.
015:007 If there be among you a poor man H0034 of one H0259 of thy brethren H0251 within any H0259 of thy gates H8179 in thy land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, thou shalt not harden H0553 (8762) thine heart H3824, nor shut H7092 (8799) thine hand H3027 from thy poor H0034 brother H0251:
015:008 But thou shalt open H6605 (8799) thine hand H3027 wide H6605 (8800) unto him, and shalt surely H5670 (8687) lend H5670 (8686) him sufficient H1767 for his need H4270, [in that] which he wanteth H2637 (8799).
015:009 Beware H8104 (8734) that there be not a thought H1697 in thy wicked H1100 heart H3824, saying H0559 (8800), The seventh H7651 year H8141, the year H8141 of release H8059, is at hand H7126 (8804); and thine eye H5869 be evil H7489 (8804) against thy poor H0034 brother H0251, and thou givest H5414 (8799) him nought; and he cry H7121 (8804) unto the LORD H3068 against thee, and it be sin H2399 unto thee.
015:010 Thou shalt surely H5414 (8800) give H5414 (8799) him, and thine heart H3824 shall not be grieved H3415 (8799) when thou givest H5414 (8800) unto him: because H1558 that for this thing H1697 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall bless H1288 (8762) thee in all thy works H4639, and in all that thou puttest H4916 thine hand H3027 unto.
015:011 For the poor H0034 shall never cease H2308 (8799) out of H7130 the land H0776: therefore I command H6680 (8764) thee, saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt open H6605 (8799) thine hand H3027 wide H6605 (8800) unto thy brother H0251, to thy poor H6041, and to thy needy H0034, in thy land H0776.
015:012 [And] if thy brother H0251, an Hebrew man H5680, or an Hebrew woman H5680, be sold H4376 (8735) unto thee, and serve H5647 (8804) thee six H8337 years H8141; then in the seventh H7637 year H8141 thou shalt let him go H7971 (8762) free H2670 from thee.
015:013 And when thou sendest H7971 (8762) him out free H2670 from thee, thou shalt not let him go away H7971 (8762) empty H7387:
015:014 Thou shalt furnish H6059 (8686) him liberally H6059 (8687) out of thy flock H6629, and out of thy floor H1637, and out of thy winepress H3342: [of that] wherewith the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8765) thee thou shalt give H5414 (8799) unto him.
015:015 And thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) that thou wast a bondman H5650 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 redeemed H6299 (8799) thee: therefore I command H6680 (8764) thee this thing H1697 to day H3117.
015:016 And it shall be, if he say H0559 (8799) unto thee, I will not go away H3318 (8799) from thee; because he loveth H0157 (8804) thee and thine house H1004, because he is well H2895 (8804) with thee;
015:017 Then thou shalt take H3947 (8804) an aul H4836, and thrust H5414 (8804) [it] through his ear H0241 unto the door H1817, and he shall be thy servant H5650 for ever H5769. And also unto thy maidservant H0519 thou shalt do H6213 (8799) likewise.
015:018 It shall not seem hard H7185 (8799) unto thee H5869, when thou sendest him away H7971 (8763) free H2670 from thee; for he hath been worth H7939 a double H4932 hired servant H7916 [to thee], in serving H5647 (8804) thee six H8337 years H8141: and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall bless H1288 (8765) thee in all that thou doest H6213 (8799).
015:019 All the firstling H1060 males H2145 that come H3205 (8735) of thy herd H1241 and of thy flock H6629 thou shalt sanctify H6942 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: thou shalt do no work H5647 (8799) with the firstling H1060 of thy bullock H7794, nor shear H1494 (8799) the firstling H1060 of thy sheep H6629.
015:020 Thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) [it] before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 year H8141 by year H8141 in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799), thou and thy household H1004.
015:021 And if there be [any] blemish H3971 therein, [as if it be] lame H6455, or blind H5787, [or have] any ill H7451 blemish H3971, thou shalt not sacrifice H2076 (8799) it unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
015:022 Thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) it within thy gates H8179: the unclean H2931 and the clean H2889 [person shall eat it] alike H3162, as the roebuck H6643, and as the hart H0354.
015:023 Only thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) the blood H1818 thereof; thou shalt pour H8210 (8799) it upon the ground H0776 as water H4325.
016:001 ¶ Observe H8104 (8800) the month H2320 of Abib H0024, and keep H6213 (8804) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: for in the month H2320 of Abib H0024 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 brought thee forth H3318 (8689) out of Egypt H4714 by night H3915.
016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice H2076 (8804) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, of the flock H6629 and the herd H1241, in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799) to place H7931 (8763) his name H8034 there.
016:003 Thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) no leavened bread H2557 with it; seven H7651 days H3117 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) unleavened bread H4682 therewith, [even] the bread H3899 of affliction H6040; for thou camest forth H3318 (8804) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 in haste H2649: that thou mayest remember H2142 (8799) the day H3117 when thou camest forth H3318 (8800) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 all the days H3117 of thy life H2416.
016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread H7603 seen H7200 (8735) with thee in all thy coast H1366 seven H7651 days H3117; neither shall there [any thing] of the flesh H1320, which thou sacrificedst H2076 (8799) the first H7223 day H3117 at even H6153, remain H3885 (8799) all night until the morning H1242.
016:005 Thou mayest H3201 (8799) not sacrifice H2076 (8800) the passover H6453 within any H0259 of thy gates H8179, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee:
016:006 But at the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799) to place H7931 (8763) his name H8034 in, there thou shalt sacrifice H2076 (8799) the passover H6453 at even H6153, at the going down H0935 (8800) of the sun H8121, at the season H4150 that thou camest forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714.
016:007 And thou shalt roast H1310 (8765) and eat H0398 (8804) [it] in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799): and thou shalt turn H6437 (8804) in the morning H1242, and go H1980 (8804) unto thy tents H0168.
016:008 Six H8337 days H3117 thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) unleavened bread H4682: and on the seventh H7637 day H3117 [shall be] a solemn assembly H6116 to the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: thou shalt do H6213 (8799) no work H4399 [therein].
016:009 Seven H7651 weeks H7620 shalt thou number H5608 (8799) unto thee: begin H2490 (8687) to number H5608 (8800) the seven H7651 weeks H7620 from [such time as] thou beginnest H2490 (8686) [to put] the sickle H2770 to the corn H7054.
016:010 And thou shalt keep H6213 (8804) the feast H2282 of weeks H7620 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with a tribute H4530 of a freewill offering H5071 of thine hand H3027, which thou shalt give H5414 (8799) [unto the LORD thy God], according as the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8762) thee:
016:011 And thou shalt rejoice H8055 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, thou, and thy son H1121, and thy daughter H1323, and thy manservant H5650, and thy maidservant H0519, and the Levite H3881 that [is] within thy gates H8179, and the stranger H1616, and the fatherless H3490, and the widow H0490, that [are] among H7130 you, in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8799) to place H7931 (8763) his name H8034 there.
016:012 And thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) that thou wast a bondman H5650 in Egypt H4714: and thou shalt observe H8104 (8804) and do H6213 (8804) these statutes H2706.
016:013 Thou shalt observe H6213 (8799) the feast H2282 of tabernacles H5521 seven H7651 days H3117, after that thou hast gathered H0622 (8800) in thy corn H1637 and thy wine H3342:
016:014 And thou shalt rejoice H8055 (8804) in thy feast H2282, thou, and thy son H1121, and thy daughter H1323, and thy manservant H5650, and thy maidservant H0519, and the Levite H3881, the stranger H1616, and the fatherless H3490, and the widow H0490, that [are] within thy gates H8179.
016:015 Seven H7651 days H3117 shalt thou keep a solemn feast H2287 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799): because the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall bless H1288 (8762) thee in all thine increase H8393, and in all the works H4639 of thine hands H3027, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice H8056.
016:016 Three H7969 times H6471 in a year H8141 shall all thy males H2138 appear H7200 (8735) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in the place H4725 which he shall choose H0977 (8799); in the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682, and in the feast H2282 of weeks H7620, and in the feast H2282 of tabernacles H5521: and they shall not appear H7200 (8735) before H6440 the LORD H3068 empty H7387:
016:017 Every man H0376 [shall give] as he is able H4979 H3027, according to the blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 which he hath given H5414 (8804) thee.
016:018 Judges H8199 (8802) and officers H7860 (8802) shalt thou make H5414 (8799) thee in all thy gates H8179, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, throughout thy tribes H7626: and they shall judge H8199 (8804) the people H5971 with just H6664 judgment H4941.
016:019 Thou shalt not wrest H5186 (8686) judgment H4941; thou shalt not respect H5234 (8686) persons H6440, neither take H3947 (8799) a gift H7810: for a gift H7810 doth blind H5786 (8762) the eyes H5869 of the wise H2450, and pervert H5557 (8762) the words H1697 of the righteous H6662.
016:020 That which is altogether H6664 just H6664 shalt thou follow H7291 (8799), that thou mayest live H2421 (8799), and inherit H3423 (8804) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee.
016:021 Thou shalt not plant H5193 (8799) thee a grove H0842 of any trees H6086 near unto H0681 the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which thou shalt make H6213 (8799) thee.
016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up H6965 (8686) [any] image H4676; which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hateth H8130 (8804).
017:001 ¶ Thou shalt not sacrifice H2076 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [any] bullock H7794, or sheep H7716, wherein is blemish H3971, [or] any evilfavouredness H7451 H1697: for that [is] an abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
017:002 If there be found H4672 (8735) among H7130 you, within any H0259 of thy gates H8179 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, man H0376 or woman H0802, that hath wrought H6213 (8799) wickedness H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, in transgressing H5674 (8800) his covenant H1285,
017:003 And hath gone H3212 (8799) and served H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, and worshipped H7812 (8691) them, either the sun H8121, or moon H3394, or any of the host H6635 of heaven H8064, which I have not commanded H6680 (8765);
017:004 And it be told H5046 (8717) thee, and thou hast heard H8085 (8804) [of it], and enquired H1875 (8804) diligently H3190 (8687), and, behold, [it be] true H0571, [and] the thing H1697 certain H3559 (8737), [that] such abomination H8441 is wrought H6213 (8738) in Israel H3478:
017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth H3318 (8689) that man H0376 or that woman H0802, which have committed H6213 (8804) that wicked H7451 thing H1697, unto thy gates H8179, [even] that man H0376 or that woman H0802, and shalt stone H5619 (8804) them with stones H0068, till they die H4191 (8804).
017:006 At the mouth H6310 of two H8147 witnesses H5707, or three H7969 witnesses H5707, shall he that is worthy of death H4191 (8714) be put to death H4191 (8801); [but] at the mouth H6310 of one H0259 witness H5707 he shall not be put to death H4191 (8714).
017:007 The hands H3027 of the witnesses H5707 shall be first H7223 upon him to put him to death H4191 (8687), and afterward H0314 the hands H3027 of all the people H5971. So thou shalt put H1197 the evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from among H7130 you.
017:008 If there arise a matter H1697 too hard H6381 (8735) for thee in judgment H4941, between blood H1818 and blood H1818, between plea H1779 and plea H1779, and between stroke H5061 and stroke H5061, [being] matters H1697 of controversy H7379 within thy gates H8179: then shalt thou arise H6965 (8804), and get thee up H5927 (8804) into the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799);
017:009 And thou shalt come H0935 (8804) unto the priests H3548 the Levites H3881, and unto the judge H8199 (8802) that shall be in those days H3117, and enquire H1875 (8804); and they shall shew H5046 (8689) thee the sentence H1697 of judgment H4941:
017:010 And thou shalt do H6213 (8804) according to the sentence H6310 H1697, which they of that place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799) shall shew H5046 (8686) thee; and thou shalt observe H8104 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) according to all that they inform H3384 (8686) thee:
017:011 According to the sentence H6310 of the law H8451 which they shall teach H3384 (8686) thee, and according to the judgment H4941 which they shall tell H0559 (8799) thee, thou shalt do H6213 (8799): thou shalt not decline H5493 (8799) from the sentence H1697 which they shall shew H5046 (8686) thee, [to] the right hand H3225, nor [to] the left H8040.
017:012 And the man H0376 that will do H6213 (8799) presumptuously H2087, and will not hearken H8085 (8800) unto the priest H3548 that standeth H5975 (8802) to minister H8334 (8763) there before the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, or unto the judge H8199 (8802), even that man H0376 shall die H4191 (8804): and thou shalt put away H1197 (8765) the evil H7451 from Israel H3478.
017:013 And all the people H5971 shall hear H8085 (8799), and fear H3372 (8799), and do no more presumptuously H2102 (8686).
017:014 When thou art come H0935 (8799) unto the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, and shalt possess H3423 (8804) it, and shalt dwell H3427 (8804) therein, and shalt say H0559 (8804), I will set H7760 (8799) a king H4428 over me, like as all the nations H1471 that [are] about H5439 me;
017:015 Thou shalt in any wise H7760 (8800) set H7760 (8799) [him] king H4428 over thee, whom the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799): [one] from among H7130 thy brethren H0251 shalt thou set H7760 (8799) king H4428 over thee: thou mayest H3201 (8799) not set H5414 (8800) a stranger H5237 H0376 over thee, which [is] not thy brother H0251.
017:016 But he shall not multiply H7235 (8686) horses H5483 to himself, nor cause the people H5971 to return H7725 (8686) to Egypt H4714, to the end that he should multiply H7235 (8687) horses H5483: forasmuch as the LORD H3068 hath said H0559 (8804) unto you, Ye shall henceforth H3254 (8686) return H7725 (8800) no more that way H1870.
017:017 Neither shall he multiply H7235 (8686) wives H0802 to himself, that his heart H3824 turn H5493 (8799) not away: neither shall he greatly H3966 multiply H7235 (8686) to himself silver H3701 and gold H2091.
017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth H3427 (8800) upon the throne H3678 of his kingdom H4467, that he shall write H3789 (8804) him a copy H4932 of this law H8451 in a book H5612 out of [that which is] before H6440 the priests H3548 the Levites H3881:
017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read H7121 (8804) therein all the days H3117 of his life H2416: that he may learn H3925 (8799) to fear H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068 his God H0430, to keep H8104 (8800) all the words H1697 of this law H8451 and these statutes H2706, to do H6213 (8800) them:
017:020 That his heart H3824 be not lifted up H7311 (8800) above his brethren H0251, and that he turn not aside H5493 (8800) from the commandment H4687, [to] the right hand H3225, or [to] the left H8040: to the end that he may prolong H0748 (8686) [his] days H3117 in his kingdom H4467, he, and his children H1121, in the midst H7130 of Israel H3478.
018:001 ¶ The priests H3548 the Levites H3881, [and] all the tribe H7626 of Levi H3878, shall have no part H2506 nor inheritance H5159 with Israel H3478: they shall eat H0398 (8799) the offerings H0801 of the LORD H3068 made by fire H0801, and his inheritance H5159.
018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance H5159 among H7130 their brethren H0251: the LORD H3068 [is] their inheritance H5159, as he hath said H1696 (8765) unto them.
018:003 And this shall be the priest’s H3548 due H4941 from the people H5971, from them that offer H2076 (8802) a sacrifice H2077, whether [it be] ox H7794 or sheep H7716; and they shall give H5414 (8804) unto the priest H3548 the shoulder H2220, and the two cheeks H3895, and the maw H6896.
018:004 The firstfruit H7225 [also] of thy corn H1715, of thy wine H8492, and of thine oil H3323, and the first H7225 of the fleece H1488 of thy sheep H6629, shalt thou give H5414 (8799) him.
018:005 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8804) him out of all thy tribes H7626, to stand H5975 (8800) to minister H8334 (8763) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, him and his sons H1121 for ever H3117.
018:006 And if a Levite H3881 come H0935 (8799) from any H0259 of thy gates H8179 out of all Israel H3478, where he sojourned H1481 (8802), and come H0935 (8804) with all the desire H0185 of his mind H5315 unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 shall choose H0977 (8799);
018:007 Then he shall minister H8334 (8765) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430, as all his brethren H0251 the Levites H3881 [do], which stand H5975 (8802) there before H6440 the LORD H3068.
018:008 They shall have like portions H2506 to eat H0398 (8799), beside that which cometh of the sale H4465 of his patrimony H0001.
018:009 When thou art come H0935 (8802) into the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, thou shalt not learn H3925 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) after the abominations H8441 of those nations H1471.
018:010 There shall not be found H4672 (8735) among you [any one] that maketh his son H1121 or his daughter H1323 to pass H5674 (8688) through the fire H0784, [or] that useth H7080 (8802) divination H7081, [or] an observer of times H6049 (8781), or an enchanter H5172 (8764), or a witch H3784 (8764),
018:011 Or a charmer H2266 (8802) H2267, or a consulter H7592 (8802) with familiar spirits H0178, or a wizard H3049, or a necromancer H1875 (8802) H4191 (8801).
018:012 For all that do H6213 (8802) these things [are] an abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068: and because H1558 of these abominations H8441 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 doth drive them out H3423 (8688) from before H6440 thee.
018:013 Thou shalt be perfect H8549 with the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
018:014 For these nations H1471, which thou shalt possess H3423 (8802), hearkened H8085 (8799) unto observers of times H6049 (8781), and unto diviners H7080 (8802): but as for thee, the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath not suffered H5414 (8804) thee so [to do].
018:015 The LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will raise up H6965 (8686) unto thee a Prophet H5030 from the midst H7130 of thee, of thy brethren H0251, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken H8085 (8799);
018:016 According to all that thou desiredst H7592 (8804) of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in Horeb H2722 in the day H3117 of the assembly H6951, saying H0559 (8800), Let me not hear H8085 (8800) again H3254 (8686) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 my God H0430, neither let me see H7200 (8799) this great H1419 fire H0784 any more, that I die H4191 (8799) not.
018:017 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, They have well H3190 (8689) [spoken that] which they have spoken H1696 (8765).
018:018 I will raise them up H6965 (8686) a Prophet H5030 from among H7130 their brethren H0251, like unto thee, and will put H5414 (8804) my words H1697 in his mouth H6310; and he shall speak H1696 (8765) unto them all that I shall command H6680 (8762) him.
018:019 And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever H0376 will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto my words H1697 which he shall speak H1696 (8762) in my name H8034, I will require H1875 (8799) [it] of him.
018:020 But the prophet H5030, which shall presume H2102 (8686) to speak H1696 (8763) a word H1697 in my name H8034, which I have not commanded H6680 (8765) him to speak H1696 (8763), or that shall speak H1696 (8762) in the name H8034 of other H0312 gods H0430, even that prophet H5030 shall die H4191 (8804).
018:021 And if thou say H0559 (8799) in thine heart H3824, How shall we know H3045 (8799) the word H1697 which the LORD H3068 hath not spoken H1696 (8765)?
018:022 When a prophet H5030 speaketh H1696 (8762) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, if the thing H1697 follow not, nor come to pass H0935 (8799), that [is] the thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 hath not spoken H1696 (8765), [but] the prophet H5030 hath spoken H1696 (8765) it presumptuously H2087: thou shalt not be afraid H1481 (8799) of him.
019:001 ¶ When the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath cut off H3772 (8686) the nations H1471, whose land H0776 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, and thou succeedest H3423 (8804) them, and dwellest H3427 (8804) in their cities H5892, and in their houses H1004;
019:002 Thou shalt separate H0914 (8686) three H7969 cities H5892 for thee in the midst H8432 of thy land H0776, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee to possess H3423 (8800) it.
019:003 Thou shalt prepare H3559 (8686) thee a way H1870, and divide the coasts H1366 of thy land H0776, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth thee to inherit H5157 (8686), into three parts H8027 (8765), that every slayer H7523 (8802) may flee H5127 (8800) thither.
019:004 And this [is] the case H1697 of the slayer H7523 (8802), which shall flee H5127 (8799) thither, that he may live H2425 (8804): Whoso killeth H5221 (8686) his neighbour H7453 ignorantly H1097 H1847, whom he hated H8130 (8802) not in time H8543 past H8032;
019:005 As when a man goeth H0935 (8799) into the wood H3293 with his neighbour H7453 to hew H2404 (8800) wood H6086, and his hand H3027 fetcheth a stroke H5080 (8738) with the axe H1631 to cut down H3772 (8800) the tree H6086, and the head H1270 slippeth H5394 (8804) from the helve H6086, and lighteth H4672 (8804) upon his neighbour H7453, that he die H4191 (8804); he shall flee H5127 (8799) unto one H0259 of those cities H5892, and live H2425 (8804):
019:006 Lest the avenger H1350 (8802) of the blood H1818 (8676) pursue H7291 (8799) the slayer H0310 H7523 (8802), while H3588 his heart H3824 is hot H3179 (8799), and overtake H5381 (8689) him, because the way H1870 is long H7235 (8799), and slay H5221 (8689) him H5315; whereas he [was] not worthy H4941 of death H4194, inasmuch as H3588 he hated H8130 (8802) him not in time H8543 past H8032.
019:007 Wherefore I command H6680 (8764) thee, saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt separate H0914 (8686) three H7969 cities H5892 for thee.
019:008 And if the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 enlarge H7337 (8686) thy coast H1366, as he hath sworn H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, and give H5414 (8804) thee all the land H0776 which he promised H1696 (8765) to give H5414 (8800) unto thy fathers H0001;
019:009 If thou shalt keep H8104 (8799) all these commandments H4687 to do H6213 (8800) them, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and to walk H3212 (8800) ever H3117 in his ways H1870; then shalt thou add H3254 (8804) three H7969 cities H5892 more for thee, beside these three H7969:
019:010 That innocent H5355 blood H1818 be not shed H8210 (8735) in H7130 thy land H0776, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159, and [so] blood H1818 be upon thee.
019:011 But if any man H0376 hate H8130 (8802) his neighbour H7453, and lie in wait H0693 (8804) for him, and rise up H6965 (8804) against him, and smite H5221 (8689) him mortally H5315 that he die H4191 (8804), and fleeth H5127 (8804) into one H0259 of these H0411 cities H5892:
019:012 Then the elders H2205 of his city H5892 shall send H7971 (8804) and fetch H3947 (8804) him thence, and deliver H5414 (8804) him into the hand H3027 of the avenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818, that he may die H4191 (8804).
019:013 Thine eye H5869 shall not pity H2347 (8799) him, but thou shalt put away H1197 (8765) [the guilt of] innocent H5355 blood H1818 from Israel H3478, that it may go well H2895 (8804) with thee.
019:014 Thou shalt not remove H5253 (8686) thy neighbour’s H7453 landmark H1366, which they of old time H7223 have set H1379 (8804) in thine inheritance H5159, which thou shalt inherit H5157 (8799) in the land H0776 that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee to possess H3423 (8800) it.
019:015 One H0259 witness H5707 shall not rise up H6965 (8799) against a man H0376 for any iniquity H5771, or for any sin H2403, in any sin H2399 that he sinneth H2398 (8799): at the mouth H6310 of two H8147 witnesses H5707, or at the mouth H6310 of three H7969 witnesses H5707, shall the matter H1697 be established H6965 (8799).
019:016 If a false H2555 witness H5707 rise up H6965 (8799) against any man H0376 to testify H6030 (8800) against him [that which is] wrong H5627;
019:017 Then both H8147 the men H0582, between whom the controversy H7379 [is], shall stand H5975 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068, before H6440 the priests H3548 and the judges H8199 (8802), which shall be in those days H3117;
019:018 And the judges H8199 (8802) shall make diligent H3190 (8687) inquisition H1875 (8804): and, behold, [if] the witness H5707 [be] a false H8267 witness H5707, [and] hath testified H6030 (8804) falsely H8267 against his brother H0251;
019:019 Then shall ye do H6213 (8804) unto him, as he had thought H2161 (8804) to have done H6213 (8800) unto his brother H0251: so shalt thou put H1197 the evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from among H7130 you.
019:020 And those which remain H7604 (8737) shall hear H8085 (8799), and fear H3372 (8799), and shall henceforth H3254 (8686) commit H6213 (8800) no more any H1697 such evil H7451 among H7130 you.
019:021 And thine eye H5869 shall not pity H2347 (8799); [but] life H5315 [shall go] for life H5315, eye H5869 for eye H5869, tooth H8127 for tooth H8127, hand H3027 for hand H3027, foot H7272 for foot H7272.
020:001 ¶ When thou goest out H3318 (8799) to battle H4421 against thine enemies H0341 (8802), and seest H7200 (8804) horses H5483, and chariots H7393, [and] a people H5971 more H7227 than thou, be not afraid H3372 (8799) of them: for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] with thee, which brought thee up H5927 (8688) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh H7126 (8800) unto the battle H4421, that the priest H3548 shall approach H5066 (8738) and speak H1696 (8765) unto the people H5971,
020:003 And shall say H0559 (8804) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478, ye approach H7131 this day H3117 unto battle H4421 against your enemies H0341 (8802): let not your hearts H3824 faint H7401 (8735), fear H3372 (8799) not, and do not tremble H2648 (8799), neither be ye terrified H6206 (8799) because H6440 of them;
020:004 For the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [is] he that goeth H1980 (8802) with you, to fight H3898 (8736) for you against your enemies H0341 (8802), to save H3467 (8687) you.
020:005 And the officers H7860 (8802) shall speak H1696 (8765) unto the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), What man H0376 [is there] that hath built H1129 (8804) a new H2319 house H1004, and hath not dedicated H2596 (8804) it? let him go H3212 (8799) and return H7725 (8799) to his house H1004, lest he die H4191 (8799) in the battle H4421, and another H0312 man H0376 dedicate H2596 (8799) it.
020:006 And what man H0376 [is he] that hath planted H5193 (8804) a vineyard H3754, and hath not [yet] eaten H2490 (8765) of it? let him [also] go H3212 (8799) and return H7725 (8799) unto his house H1004, lest he die H4191 (8799) in the battle H4421, and another H0312 man H0376 eat H2490 (8762) of it.
020:007 And what man H0376 [is there] that hath betrothed H0781 (8765) a wife H0802, and hath not taken H3947 (8804) her? let him go H3212 (8799) and return H7725 (8799) unto his house H1004, lest he die H4191 (8799) in the battle H4421, and another H0312 man H0376 take H3947 (8799) her.
020:008 And the officers H7860 (8802) shall speak H1696 (8763) further H3254 (8804) unto the people H5971, and they shall say H0559 (8804), What man H0376 [is there that is] fearful H3373 and fainthearted H7390 H3824? let him go H3212 (8799) and return H7725 (8799) unto his house H1004, lest his brethren’s H0251 heart H3824 faint H4549 (8735) as well as his heart H3824.
020:009 And it shall be, when the officers H7860 (8802) have made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) unto the people H5971, that they shall make H6485 (8804) captains H8269 of the armies H6635 to lead H7218 the people H5971.
020:010 When thou comest nigh H7126 (8799) unto a city H5892 to fight H3898 (8736) against it, then proclaim H7121 (8804) peace H7965 unto it.
020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer H6030 (8799) of peace H7965, and open H6605 (8804) unto thee, then it shall be, [that] all the people H5971 [that is] found H4672 (8737) therein shall be tributaries H4522 unto thee, and they shall serve H5647 (8804) thee.
020:012 And if it will make no peace H7999 (8686) with thee, but will make H6213 (8804) war H4421 against thee, then thou shalt besiege H6696 (8804) it:
020:013 And when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) it into thine hands H3027, thou shalt smite H5221 (8689) every male H2138 thereof with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719:
020:014 But the women H0802, and the little ones H2945, and the cattle H0929, and all that is in the city H5892, [even] all the spoil H7998 thereof, shalt thou take H0962 (8799) unto thyself; and thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) the spoil H7998 of thine enemies H0341 (8802), which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) thee.
020:015 Thus shalt thou do H6213 (8799) unto all the cities H5892 [which are] very H3966 far off H7350 from thee, which H2007 [are] not of the cities H5892 of these nations H1471.
020:016 But of the cities H5892 of these people H5971, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 doth give H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159, thou shalt save alive H2421 (8762) nothing that breatheth H5397:
020:017 But thou shalt utterly H2763 (8687) destroy H2763 (8686) them; [namely], the Hittites H2850, and the Amorites H0567, the Canaanites H3669, and the Perizzites H6522, the Hivites H2340, and the Jebusites H2983; as the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) thee:
020:018 That they teach H3925 (8762) you not to do H6213 (8800) after all their abominations H8441, which they have done H6213 (8804) unto their gods H0430; so should ye sin H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
020:019 When thou shalt besiege H6696 (8799) a city H5892 a long H7227 time H3117, in making war H3898 (8736) against it to take H8610 (8800) it, thou shalt not destroy H7843 (8686) the trees H6086 thereof by forcing H5080 (8800) an axe H1631 against them: for thou mayest eat H0398 (8799) of them, and thou shalt not cut them down H3772 (8799) (for the tree H6086 of the field H7704 [is] man’s H0120 [life]) to employ H0935 (8800) [them] in the siege H6440 H4692:
020:020 Only the trees H6086 which thou knowest H3045 (8799) that they [be] not trees H6086 for meat H3978, thou shalt destroy H7843 (8686) and cut them down H3772 (8804); and thou shalt build H1129 (8804) bulwarks H4692 against the city H5892 that maketh H6213 (8802) war H4421 with thee, until it be subdued H3381 (8800).
021:001 ¶ If [one] be found H4672 (8735) slain H2491 in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee to possess H3423 (8800) it, lying H5307 (8802) in the field H7704, [and] it be not known H3045 (8738) who hath slain H5221 (8689) him:
021:002 Then thy elders H2205 and thy judges H8199 (8802) shall come forth H3318 (8804), and they shall measure H4058 (8804) unto the cities H5892 which [are] round about H5439 him that is slain H2491:
021:003 And it shall be, [that] the city H5892 [which is] next H7138 unto the slain man H2491, even the elders H2205 of that city H5892 shall take H3947 (8804) an heifer H1241 H5697, which hath not been wrought with H5647 (8795), [and] which hath not drawn H4900 (8804) in the yoke H5923;
021:004 And the elders H2205 of that city H5892 shall bring down H3381 (8689) the heifer H5697 unto a rough H0386 valley H5158, which is neither eared H5647 (8735) nor sown H2232 (8735), and shall strike off H6202 the heifer’s H5697 neck H6202 (8804) there in the valley H5158:
021:005 And the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Levi H3878 shall come near H5066 (8738); for them the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8804) to minister H8334 (8763) unto him, and to bless H1288 (8763) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068; and by their word H6310 shall every controversy H7379 and every stroke H5061 be [tried]:
021:006 And all the elders H2205 of that city H5892, [that are] next H7138 unto the slain H2491 [man], shall wash H7364 (8799) their hands H3027 over the heifer H5697 that is beheaded H6202 (8803) in the valley H5158:
021:007 And they shall answer H6030 (8804) and say H0559 (8804), Our hands H3027 have not shed H8210 (8804) this blood H1818, neither have our eyes H5869 seen H7200 (8804) [it].
021:008 Be merciful H3722 (8761), O LORD H3068, unto thy people H5971 Israel H3478, whom thou hast redeemed H6299 (8804), and lay H5414 (8799) not innocent H5355 blood H1818 unto thy people H5971 of Israel’s H3478 charge H7130. And the blood H1818 shall be forgiven H3722 (8694) them.
021:009 So shalt thou put away H1197 (8762) the [guilt of] innocent H5355 blood H1818 from among H7130 you, when thou shalt do H6213 (8799) [that which is] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
021:010 When thou goest forth H3318 (8799) to war H4421 against thine enemies H0341 (8802), and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) them into thine hands H3027, and thou hast taken H7617 (8804) them captive H7628,
021:011 And seest H7200 (8804) among the captives H7633 a beautiful H8389 H3303 woman H0802, and hast a desire H2836 (8804) unto her, that thou wouldest have her H3947 (8804) to thy wife H0802;
021:012 Then thou shalt bring H0935 (8689) her home H8432 to thine house H1004; and she shall shave H1548 (8765) her head H7218, and pare H6213 (8804) her nails H6856;
021:013 And she shall put H5493 (8689) the raiment H8071 of her captivity H7628 from off her, and shall remain H3427 (8804) in thine house H1004, and bewail H1058 (8804) her father H0001 and her mother H0517 a full H3117 month H3391: and after H0310 that thou shalt go H0935 (8799) in unto her, and be her husband H1166 (8804), and she shall be thy wife H0802.
021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight H2654 (8804) in her, then thou shalt let her go H7971 (8765) whither she will H5315; but thou shalt not sell H4376 (8799) her at all H4376 (8800) for money H3701, thou shalt not make merchandise H6014 (8691) of her, because H0834 thou hast humbled H6031 (8765) her.
021:015 If a man H0376 have two H8147 wives H0802, one H0259 beloved H0157 (8803), and another H0259 hated H8130 (8803), and they have born H3205 (8804) him children H1121, [both] the beloved H0157 (8803) and the hated H8130 (8803); and [if] the firstborn H1060 son H1121 be hers that was hated H8146:
021:016 Then it shall be, when H3117 he maketh his sons H1121 to inherit H5157 (8687) [that] which he hath, [that] he may H3201 (8799) not make the son H1121 of the beloved H0157 (8803) firstborn H1069 (8763) before H6440 the son H1121 of the hated H8130 (8803), [which is indeed] the firstborn H1060:
021:017 But he shall acknowledge H5234 (8686) the son H1121 of the hated H8130 (8803) [for] the firstborn H1060, by giving H5414 (8800) him a double H8147 portion H6310 of all that he hath H4672 (8735): for he [is] the beginning H7225 of his strength H0202; the right H4941 of the firstborn H1062 [is] his.
021:018 If a man H0376 have a stubborn H5637 (8802) and rebellious H4784 (8802) son H1121, which will not obey H8085 (8802) the voice H6963 of his father H0001, or the voice H6963 of his mother H0517, and [that], when they have chastened H3256 (8765) him, will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto them:
021:019 Then shall his father H0001 and his mother H0517 lay hold H8610 (8804) on him, and bring him out H3318 (8689) unto the elders H2205 of his city H5892, and unto the gate H8179 of his place H4725;
021:020 And they shall say H0559 (8804) unto the elders H2205 of his city H5892, This our son H1121 [is] stubborn H5637 (8802) and rebellious H4784 (8802), he will not obey H8085 (8802) our voice H6963; [he is] a glutton H2151 (8802), and a drunkard H5433 (8802).
021:021 And all the men H0582 of his city H5892 shall stone H7275 (8804) him with stones H0068, that he die H4191 (8804): so shalt thou put H1197 evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from among H7130 you; and all Israel H3478 shall hear H8085 (8799), and fear H3372 (8799).
021:022 And if a man H0376 have committed a sin H2399 worthy of H4941 death H4194, and he be to be put to death H4191 (8717), and thou hang H8518 (8804) him on a tree H6086:
021:023 His body H5038 shall not remain all night H3885 (8799) upon the tree H6086, but thou shalt in any wise H6912 (8800) bury H6912 (8799) him that day H3117; (for he that is hanged H8518 (8803) [is] accursed H7045 of God H0430;) that thy land H0127 be not defiled H2930 (8762), which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159.
022:001 ¶ Thou shalt not see H7200 (8799) thy brother’s H0251 ox H7794 or his sheep H7716 go astray H5080 (8737), and hide H5956 (8694) thyself from them: thou shalt in any case H7725 (8687) bring them again H7725 (8686) unto thy brother H0251.
022:002 And if thy brother H0251 [be] not nigh H7138 unto thee, or if thou know H3045 (8804) him not, then thou shalt bring H0622 (8804) it unto H8432 thine own house H1004, and it shall be with thee until thy brother H0251 seek H1875 (8800) after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again H7725 (8689).
022:003 In like manner H3651 shalt thou do H6213 (8799) with his ass H2543; and so shalt thou do H6213 (8799) with his raiment H8071; and with all lost thing H0009 of thy brother’s H0251, which he hath lost H0006 (8799), and thou hast found H4672 (8804), shalt thou do H6213 (8799) likewise: thou mayest H3201 (8799) not hide H5956 (8692) thyself.
022:004 Thou shalt not see H7200 (8799) thy brother’s H0251 ass H2543 or his ox H7794 fall down H5307 (8802) by the way H1870, and hide H5956 (8694) thyself from them: thou shalt surely H6965 (8687) help him to lift [them] up again H6965 (8686).
022:005 The woman H0802 shall not wear that which pertaineth H3627 unto a man H1397, neither shall a man H1397 put H3847 (8799) on a woman’s H0802 garment H8071: for all that do H6213 (8802) so H0428 [are] abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
022:006 If a bird’s H6833 nest H7064 chance H7122 (8735) to be before H6440 thee in the way H1870 in any tree H6086, or on the ground H0776, [whether they be] young ones H0667, or eggs H1000, and the dam H0517 sitting H7257 (8802) upon the young H0667, or upon the eggs H1000, thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) the dam H0517 with the young H1121:
022:007 [But] thou shalt in any wise H7971 (8763) let the dam H0517 go H7971 (8762), and take H3947 (8799) the young H1121 to thee; that it may be well H3190 (8799) with thee, and [that] thou mayest prolong H0748 (8689) [thy] days H3117.
022:008 When thou buildest H1129 (8799) a new H2319 house H1004, then thou shalt make H6213 (8804) a battlement H4624 for thy roof H1406, that thou bring H7760 (8799) not blood H1818 upon thine house H1004, if any man H5307 (8802) fall H5307 (8799) from thence.
022:009 Thou shalt not sow H2232 (8799) thy vineyard H3754 with divers seeds H3610: lest the fruit H4395 of thy seed H2233 which thou hast sown H2232 (8799), and the fruit H8393 of thy vineyard H3754, be defiled H6942 (8799).
022:010 Thou shalt not plow H2790 (8799) with an ox H7794 and an ass H2543 together H3162.
022:011 Thou shalt not wear H3847 (8799) a garment of divers sorts H8162, [as] of woollen H6785 and linen H6593 together H3162.
022:012 Thou shalt make H6213 (8799) thee fringes H1434 upon the four H0702 quarters H3671 of thy vesture H3682, wherewith thou coverest H3680 (8762) [thyself].
022:013 If any man H0376 take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802, and go in H0935 (8804) unto her, and hate H8130 (8804) her,
022:014 And give H7760 (8804) occasions H5949 of speech H1697 against her, and bring up H3318 (8689) an evil H7451 name H8034 upon her, and say H0559 (8804), I took H3947 (8804) this woman H0802, and when I came H7126 (8799) to her, I found H4672 (8804) her not a maid H1331:
022:015 Then shall the father H0001 of the damsel H5291, and her mother H0517, take H3947 (8804) and bring forth H3318 (8689) [the tokens of] the damsel’s H5291 virginity H1331 unto the elders H2205 of the city H5892 in the gate H8179:
022:016 And the damsel’s H5291 father H0001 shall say H0559 (8804) unto the elders H2205, I gave H5414 (8804) my daughter H1323 unto this man H0376 to wife H0802, and he hateth H8130 (8799) her;
022:017 And, lo, he hath given H7760 (8804) occasions H5949 of speech H1697 [against her], saying H0559 (8800), I found H4672 (8804) not thy daughter H1323 a maid H1331; and yet these [are the tokens of] my daughter’s H1323 virginity H1331. And they shall spread H6566 (8804) the cloth H8071 before H6440 the elders H2205 of the city H5892.
022:018 And the elders H2205 of that city H5892 shall take H3947 (8804) that man H0376 and chastise H3256 (8765) him;
022:019 And they shall amerce H6064 (8804) him in an hundred H3967 [shekels] of silver H3701, and give H5414 (8804) [them] unto the father H0001 of the damsel H5291, because he hath brought up H3318 (8689) an evil H7451 name H8034 upon a virgin H1330 of Israel H3478: and she shall be his wife H0802; he may H3201 (8799) not put her away H7971 (8763) all his days H3117.
022:020 But if this thing H1697 be true H0571, [and the tokens of] virginity H1331 be not found H4672 (8738) for the damsel H5291:
022:021 Then they shall bring out H3318 (8689) the damsel H5291 to the door H6607 of her father’s H0001 house H1004, and the men H0582 of her city H5892 shall stone H5619 (8804) her with stones H0068 that she die H4191 (8804): because she hath wrought H6213 (8804) folly H5039 in Israel H3478, to play the whore H2181 (8800) in her father’s H0001 house H1004: so shalt thou put H1197 evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from among H7130 you.
022:022 If a man H0376 be found H4672 (8735) lying H7901 (8802) with a woman H0802 married H1166 (8803) to an husband H1167, then they shall both of them H8147 die H4191 (8804), [both] the man H0376 that lay H7901 (8802) with the woman H0802, and the woman H0802: so shalt thou put away H1197 (8765) evil H7451 from Israel H3478.
022:023 If a damsel H5291 [that is] a virgin H1330 be betrothed H0781 (8794) unto an husband H0376, and a man H0376 find H4672 (8804) her in the city H5892, and lie H7901 (8804) with her;
022:024 Then ye shall bring H3318 (8689) them both H8147 out unto the gate H8179 of that city H5892, and ye shall stone H5619 (8804) them with stones H0068 that they die H4191 (8804); the damsel H5291, because H0834 H1697 she cried H6817 (8804) not, [being] in the city H5892; and the man H0376, because H0834 H1697 he hath humbled H6031 (8765) his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802: so thou shalt put away H1197 (8765) evil H7451 from among H7130 you.
022:025 But if a man H0376 find H4672 (8799) a betrothed H0781 (8794) damsel H5291 in the field H7704, and the man H0376 force H2388 (8689) her, and lie H7901 (8804) with her: then the man H0376 only that lay H7901 (8804) with her shall die H4191 (8804):
022:026 But unto the damsel H5291 thou shalt do H6213 (8799) nothing H1697; [there is] in the damsel H5291 no sin H2399 [worthy] of death H4194: for as when a man H0376 riseth H6965 (8799) against his neighbour H7453, and slayeth H7523 (8804) (8676) H5315 him, even so [is] this matter H1697:
022:027 For he found H4672 (8804) her in the field H7704, [and] the betrothed H0781 (8794) damsel H5291 cried H6817 (8804), and [there was] none to save H3467 (8688) her.
022:028 If a man H0376 find H4672 (8799) a damsel H5291 [that is] a virgin H1330, which is not betrothed H0781 (8795), and lay hold H8610 (8804) on her, and lie H7901 (8804) with her, and they be found H4672 (8738);
022:029 Then the man H0376 that lay H7901 (8802) with her shall give H5414 (8804) unto the damsel’s H5291 father H0001 fifty H2572 [shekels] of silver H3701, and she shall be his wife H0802; because he hath humbled H6031 (8765) her, he may H3201 (8799) not put her away H7971 (8763) all his days H3117.
022:030 A man H0376 shall not take H3947 (8799) his father’s H0001 wife H0802, nor discover H1540 (8762) his father’s H0001 skirt H3671.
023:001 ¶ He that is wounded in the stones H6481 (8803) H1795, or hath his privy member H8212 cut off H3772 (8803), shall not enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068.
023:002 A bastard H4464 shall not enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068; even to his tenth H6224 generation H1755 shall he not enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068.
023:003 An Ammonite H5984 or Moabite H4125 shall not enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068; even to their tenth H6224 generation H1755 shall they not enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068 for H5704 ever H5769:
023:004 Because H1697 they met H6923 (8765) you not with bread H3899 and with water H4325 in the way H1870, when ye came forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714; and because they hired H7936 (8804) against thee Balaam H1109 the son H1121 of Beor H1160 of Pethor H6604 of Mesopotamia H0763, to curse H7043 (8763) thee.
023:005 Nevertheless the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto Balaam H1109; but the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 turned H2015 (8799) the curse H7045 into a blessing H1293 unto thee, because the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 loved H0157 (8804) thee.
023:006 Thou shalt not seek H1875 (8799) their peace H7965 nor their prosperity H2896 all thy days H3117 for ever H5769.
023:007 Thou shalt not abhor H8581 (8762) an Edomite H0130; for he [is] thy brother H0251: thou shalt not abhor H8581 (8762) an Egyptian H4713; because thou wast a stranger H1616 in his land H0776.
023:008 The children H1121 that are begotten H3205 (8735) of them shall enter H0935 (8799) into the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068 in their third H7992 generation H1755.
023:009 When the host H4264 goeth forth H3318 (8799) against thine enemies H0341 (8802), then keep H8104 (8738) thee from every wicked H7451 thing H1697.
023:010 If there be among you any man H0376, that is not clean H2889 by reason of uncleanness that chanceth H7137 him by night H3915, then shall he go H3318 (8804) abroad H2351 out of the camp H4264, he shall not come H0935 (8799) within H8432 the camp H4264:
023:011 But it shall be, when evening H6153 cometh on H6437 (8800), he shall wash H7364 (8799) [himself] with water H4325: and when the sun H8121 is down H0935 (8800), he shall come H0935 (8799) into H8432 the camp H4264 [again].
023:012 Thou shalt have a place also H3027 without H2351 the camp H4264, whither thou shalt go forth H3318 (8804) abroad H2351:
023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle H3489 upon thy weapon H0240; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease H3427 (8800) thyself abroad H2351, thou shalt dig H2658 (8804) therewith, and shalt turn back H7725 (8804) and cover H3680 (8765) that which cometh H6627 from thee:
023:014 For the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 walketh H1980 (8693) in the midst H7130 of thy camp H4264, to deliver H5337 (8687) thee, and to give up H5414 (8800) thine enemies H0341 (8802) before H6440 thee; therefore shall thy camp H4264 be holy H6918: that he see H7200 (8799) no unclean H6172 thing H1697 in thee, and turn away H7725 (8804) from thee H0310.
023:015 Thou shalt not deliver H5462 (8686) unto his master H0113 the servant H5650 which is escaped H5337 (8735) from his master H0113 unto thee:
023:016 He shall dwell H3427 (8799) with thee, [even] among H7130 you, in that place H4725 which he shall choose H0977 (8799) in one H0259 of thy gates H8179, where it liketh him best H2896: thou shalt not oppress H3238 (8686) him.
023:017 There shall be no whore H6948 of the daughters H1323 of Israel H3478, nor a sodomite H6945 of the sons H1121 of Israel H3478.
023:018 Thou shalt not bring H0935 (8686) the hire H0868 of a whore H2181 (8802), or the price H4242 of a dog H3611, into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 for any vow H5088: for even both H8147 these [are] abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury H5391 (8686) to thy brother H0251; usury H5392 of money H3701, usury H5392 of victuals H0400, usury H5392 of any thing H1697 that is lent upon usury H5391 (8799):
023:020 Unto a stranger H5237 thou mayest lend upon usury H5391 (8686); but unto thy brother H0251 thou shalt not lend upon usury H5391 (8686): that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 may bless H1288 (8762) thee in all that thou settest H4916 thine hand H3027 to in the land H0776 whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
023:021 When thou shalt vow H5087 (8799) a vow H5088 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, thou shalt not slack H0309 (8762) to pay H7999 (8763) it: for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will surely H1875 (8800) require H1875 (8799) it of thee; and it would be sin H2399 in thee.
023:022 But if thou shalt forbear H2308 (8799) to vow H5087 (8800), it shall be no sin H2399 in thee.
023:023 That which is gone out H4161 of thy lips H8193 thou shalt keep H8104 (8799) and perform H6213 (8804); [even] a freewill offering H5071, according as thou hast vowed H5087 (8804) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which thou hast promised H1696 (8765) with thy mouth H6310.
023:024 When thou comest H0935 (8799) into thy neighbour’s H7453 vineyard H3754, then thou mayest eat H0398 (8804) grapes H6025 thy fill H7648 at thine own pleasure H5315; but thou shalt not put H5414 (8799) [any] in thy vessel H3627.
023:025 When thou comest H0935 (8799) into the standing corn H7054 of thy neighbour H7453, then thou mayest pluck H6998 (8804) the ears H4425 with thine hand H3027; but thou shalt not move H5130 (8686) a sickle H2770 unto thy neighbour’s H7453 standing corn H7054.
024:001 ¶ When a man H0376 hath taken H3947 (8799) a wife H0802, and married H1166 (8804) her, and it come to pass that she find H4672 (8799) no favour H2580 in his eyes H5869, because he hath found H4672 (8804) some H1697 uncleanness H6172 in her: then let him write H3789 (8804) her a bill H5612 of divorcement H3748, and give H5414 (8804) [it] in her hand H3027, and send H7971 (8765) her out of his house H1004.
024:002 And when she is departed out H3318 (8804) of his house H1004, she may go H1980 (8804) and be another H0312 man’s H0376 [wife].
024:003 And [if] the latter H0314 husband H0376 hate H8130 (8804) her, and write H3789 (8804) her a bill H5612 of divorcement H3748, and giveth H5414 (8804) [it] in her hand H3027, and sendeth H7971 (8765) her out of his house H1004; or if the latter H0314 husband H0376 die H4191 (8799), which took H3947 (8804) her [to be] his wife H0802;
024:004 Her former H7223 husband H1167, which sent her away H7971 (8765), may H3201 (8799) not take H3947 (8800) her again H7725 (8800) to be his wife H0802, after H0310 that she is defiled H2930 (8719); for that [is] abomination H8441 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and thou shalt not cause the land H0776 to sin H2398 (8686), which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159.
024:005 When a man H0376 hath taken H3947 (8799) a new H2319 wife H0802, he shall not go out H3318 (8799) to war H6635, neither shall he be charged H5674 (8799) with any business H1697: [but] he shall be free H5355 at home H1004 one H0259 year H8141, and shall cheer up H8055 (8765) his wife H0802 which he hath taken H3947 (8804).
024:006 No man shall take H2254 the nether H7347 or the upper millstone H7393 to pledge H2254 (8799): for he taketh H2254 [a man’s] life H5315 to pledge H2254 (8802).
024:007 If a man H0376 be found H4672 (8735) stealing H1589 (8802) any H5315 of his brethren H0251 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and maketh merchandise H6014 (8694) of him, or selleth H4376 (8804) him; then that thief H1590 shall die H4191 (8804); and thou shalt put H1197 evil H7451 away H1197 (8765) from among H7130 you.
024:008 Take heed H8104 (8734) in the plague H5061 of leprosy H6883, that thou observe H8104 (8800) diligently H3966, and do H6213 (8800) according to all that the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 shall teach H3384 (8686) you: as I commanded H6680 (8765) them, [so] ye shall observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800).
024:009 Remember H2142 (8800) what the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 did H6213 (8804) unto Miriam H4813 by the way H1870, after that ye were come forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714.
024:010 When thou dost lend H5383 (8686) thy brother H7453 any H3972 thing H4859, thou shalt not go H0935 (8799) into his house H1004 to fetch H5670 (8800) his pledge H5667.
024:011 Thou shalt stand H5975 (8799) abroad H2351, and the man H0376 to whom thou dost lend H5383 (8802) shall bring out H3318 (8686) the pledge H5667 abroad H2351 unto thee.
024:012 And if the man H0376 [be] poor H6041, thou shalt not sleep H7901 (8799) with his pledge H5667:
024:013 In any case H7725 (8687) thou shalt deliver H7725 him the pledge H5667 again H7725 (8686) when the sun H8121 goeth down H0935 (8800), that he may sleep H7901 (8804) in his own raiment H8008, and bless H1288 (8765) thee: and it shall be righteousness H6666 unto thee before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
024:014 Thou shalt not oppress H6231 (8799) an hired servant H7916 [that is] poor H6041 and needy H0034, [whether he be] of thy brethren H0251, or of thy strangers H1616 that [are] in thy land H0776 within thy gates H8179:
024:015 At his day H3117 thou shalt give H5414 (8799) [him] his hire H7939, neither shall the sun H8121 go down H0935 (8799) upon it; for he [is] poor H6041, and setteth H5375 (8802) his heart H5315 upon it: lest he cry H7121 (8799) against thee unto the LORD H3068, and it be sin H2399 unto thee.
024:016 The fathers H0001 shall not be put to death H4191 (8714) for the children H1121, neither shall the children H1121 be put to death H4191 (8714) for the fathers H0001: every man H0376 shall be put to death H4191 (8714) for his own sin H2399.
024:017 Thou shalt not pervert H5186 (8686) the judgment H4941 of the stranger H1616, [nor] of the fatherless H3490; nor take H2254 a widow’s H0490 raiment H0899 to pledge H2254 (8799):
024:018 But thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) that thou wast a bondman H5650 in Egypt H4714, and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 redeemed H6299 (8799) thee thence: therefore I command H6680 (8764) thee to do H6213 (8800) this thing H1697.
024:019 When thou cuttest down H7114 (8799) thine harvest H7105 in thy field H7704, and hast forgot H7911 (8804) a sheaf H6016 in the field H7704, thou shalt not go again H7725 (8799) to fetch H3947 (8800) it: it shall be for the stranger H1616, for the fatherless H3490, and for the widow H0490: that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 may bless H1288 (8762) thee in all the work H4639 of thine hands H3027.
024:020 When thou beatest H2251 (8799) thine olive tree H2132, thou shalt not go over the boughs H6286 (8762) again H0310: it shall be for the stranger H1616, for the fatherless H3490, and for the widow H0490.
024:021 When thou gatherest H1219 (8799) the grapes of thy vineyard H3754, thou shalt not glean H5953 (8779) [it] afterward H0310: it shall be for the stranger H1616, for the fatherless H3490, and for the widow H0490.
024:022 And thou shalt remember H2142 (8804) that thou wast a bondman H5650 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: therefore I command H6680 (8764) thee to do H6213 (8800) this thing H1697.
025:001 ¶ If there be a controversy H7379 between men H0582, and they come H5066 (8738) unto judgment H4941, that [the judges] may judge H8199 (8804) them; then they shall justify H6663 (8689) the righteous H6662, and condemn H7561 (8689) the wicked H7563.
025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man H7563 [be] worthy H1121 to be beaten H5221 (8687), that the judge H8199 (8802) shall cause him to lie down H5307 (8689), and to be beaten H5221 (8689) before his face H6440, according H1767 to his fault H7564, by a certain number H4557.
025:003 Forty H0705 stripes H5221 (8686) he may give him, [and] not exceed H3254 (8686): lest, [if] he should exceed H3254 (8686), and beat H5221 (8687) him above these with many H7227 stripes H4347, then thy brother H0251 should seem vile H7034 (8738) H5869 unto thee.
025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle H2629 (8799) the ox H7794 when he treadeth out H1778 (8800) [the corn].
025:005 If brethren H0251 dwell H3427 (8799) together H3162, and one H0259 of them die H4191 (8804), and have no child H1121, the wife H0802 of the dead H4191 (8801) shall not marry without H2351 unto a stranger H0376 H2114 (8801): her husband’s brother H2993 shall go in H0935 (8799) unto her, and take H3947 (8804) her to him to wife H0802, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother H2992 (8762) unto her.
025:006 And it shall be, [that] the firstborn H1060 which she beareth H3205 (8799) shall succeed H6965 (8799) in the name H8034 of his brother H0251 [which is] dead H4191 (8801), that his name H8034 be not put out H4229 (8735) of Israel H3478.
025:007 And if the man H0376 like H2654 (8799) not to take H3947 (8800) his brother’s wife H2994, then let his brother’s wife H2994 go up H5927 (8804) to the gate H8179 unto the elders H2205, and say H0559 (8804), My husband’s brother H2993 refuseth H3985 (8765) to raise up H6965 (8687) unto his brother H0251 a name H8034 in Israel H3478, he will H0014 (8804) not perform the duty of my husband’s brother H2992 (8763).
025:008 Then the elders H2205 of his city H5892 shall call H7121 (8804) him, and speak H1696 (8765) unto him: and [if] he stand H5975 (8804) [to it], and say H0559 (8804), I like H2654 (8804) not to take H3947 (8800) her;
025:009 Then shall his brother’s wife H2994 come H5066 (8738) unto him in the presence H5869 of the elders H2205, and loose H2502 (8804) his shoe H5275 from off his foot H7272, and spit H3417 (8804) in his face H6440, and shall answer H6030 (8804) and say H0559 (8804), So shall it be done H6213 (8735) unto that man H0376 that will not build up H1129 (8799) his brother’s H0251 house H1004.
025:010 And his name H8034 shall be called H7121 (8738) in Israel H3478, The house H1004 of him that hath his shoe H5275 loosed H2502 (8803).
025:011 When men H0582 strive H5327 (8735) together H3162 one with another H0251 H0376, and the wife H0802 of the one H0259 draweth near H7126 (8804) for to deliver H5337 (8687) her husband H0376 out of the hand H3027 of him that smiteth H5221 (8688) him, and putteth forth H7971 (8804) her hand H3027, and taketh H2388 (8689) him by the secrets H4016:
025:012 Then thou shalt cut off H7112 (8804) her hand H3709, thine eye H5869 shall not pity H2347 (8799) [her].
025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag H3599 divers weights H0068 H0068, a great H1419 and a small H6996.
025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house H1004 divers measures H0374 H0374, a great H1419 and a small H6996.
025:015 [But] thou shalt have a perfect H8003 and just H6664 weight H0068, a perfect H8003 and just H6664 measure H0374 shalt thou have: that thy days H3117 may be lengthened H0748 (8686) in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee.
025:016 For all that do H6213 (8802) such things H0428, [and] all that do H6213 (8802) unrighteously H5766, [are] an abomination H8441 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
025:017 Remember H2142 (8800) what Amalek H6002 did H6213 (8804) unto thee by the way H1870, when ye were come forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714;
025:018 How he met H7136 (8804) thee by the way H1870, and smote the hindmost H2179 (8762) of thee, [even] all [that were] feeble H2826 (8737) behind H0310 thee, when thou [wast] faint H5889 and weary H3023; and he feared H3373 not God H0430.
025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given thee rest H5117 (8687) from all thine enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439, in the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159 to possess H3423 (8800) it, [that] thou shalt blot out H4229 (8799) the remembrance H2143 of Amalek H6002 from under heaven H8064; thou shalt not forget H7911 (8799) [it].
026:001 ¶ And it shall be, when thou [art] come in H0935 (8799) unto the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee [for] an inheritance H5159, and possessest H3423 (8804) it, and dwellest H3427 (8804) therein;
026:002 That thou shalt take H3947 (8804) of the first H7225 of all the fruit H6529 of the earth H0127, which thou shalt bring H0935 (8686) of thy land H0776 that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, and shalt put H7760 (8804) [it] in a basket H2935, and shalt go H1980 (8804) unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall choose H0977 (8799) to place H7931 (8763) his name H8034 there.
026:003 And thou shalt go H0935 (8804) unto the priest H3548 that shall be in those days H3117, and say H0559 (8804) unto him, I profess H5046 (8689) this day H3117 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, that I am come H0935 (8804) unto the country H0776 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto our fathers H0001 for to give H5414 (8800) us.
026:004 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) the basket H2935 out of thine hand H3027, and set it down H3240 (8689) before H6440 the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
026:005 And thou shalt speak H6030 (8804) and say H0559 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, A Syrian H0761 ready to perish H0006 (8802) [was] my father H0001, and he went down H3381 (8799) into Egypt H4714, and sojourned H1481 (8799) there with H4962 a few H4592, and became there a nation H1471, great H1419, mighty H6099, and populous H7227:
026:006 And the Egyptians H4713 evil entreated H7489 (8686) us, and afflicted H6031 (8762) us, and laid H5414 (8799) upon us hard H7186 bondage H5656:
026:007 And when we cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of our fathers H0001, the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8799) our voice H6963, and looked H7200 (8799) on our affliction H6040, and our labour H5999, and our oppression H3906:
026:008 And the LORD H3068 brought us forth H3318 (8686) out of Egypt H4714 with a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and with an outstretched H5186 (8803) arm H2220, and with great H1419 terribleness H4172, and with signs H0226, and with wonders H4159:
026:009 And he hath brought H0935 (8686) us into this place H4725, and hath given H5414 (8799) us this land H0776, [even] a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
026:010 And now, behold, I have brought H0935 (8689) the firstfruits H6529 H7225 of the land H0127, which thou, O LORD H3068, hast given H5414 (8804) me. And thou shalt set H3240 (8689) it before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and worship H7812 (8694) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430:
026:011 And thou shalt rejoice H8055 (8804) in every good H2896 [thing] which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) unto thee, and unto thine house H1004, thou, and the Levite H3881, and the stranger H1616 that [is] among H7130 you.
026:012 When thou hast made an end H3615 (8762) of tithing H6237 (8687) all the tithes H4643 of thine increase H8393 the third H7992 year H8141, [which is] the year H8141 of tithing H4643, and hast given H5414 (8804) [it] unto the Levite H3881, the stranger H1616, the fatherless H3490, and the widow H0490, that they may eat H0398 (8804) within thy gates H8179, and be filled H7646 (8804);
026:013 Then thou shalt say H0559 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, I have brought away H1197 (8765) the hallowed things H6944 out of [mine] house H1004, and also have given H5414 (8804) them unto the Levite H3881, and unto the stranger H1616, to the fatherless H3490, and to the widow H0490, according to all thy commandments H4687 which thou hast commanded H6680 (8765) me: I have not transgressed H5674 (8804) thy commandments H4687, neither have I forgotten H7911 (8804) [them]:
026:014 I have not eaten H0398 (8804) thereof in my mourning H0205, neither have I taken away H1197 (8765) [ought] thereof for [any] unclean H2931 [use], nor given H5414 (8804) [ought] thereof for the dead H4191 (8801): [but] I have hearkened H8085 (8804) to the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 my God H0430, [and] have done H6213 (8804) according to all that thou hast commanded H6680 (8765) me.
026:015 Look down H8259 (8685) from thy holy H6944 habitation H4583, from heaven H8064, and bless H1288 (8761) thy people H5971 Israel H3478, and the land H0127 which thou hast given H5414 (8804) us, as thou swarest H7650 (8738) unto our fathers H0001, a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
026:016 This day H3117 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8764) thee to do H6213 (8800) these statutes H2706 and judgments H4941: thou shalt therefore keep H8104 (8804) and do H6213 (8804) them with all thine heart H3824, and with all thy soul H5315.
026:017 Thou hast avouched H0559 (8689) the LORD H3068 this day H3117 to be thy God H0430, and to walk H3212 (8800) in his ways H1870, and to keep H8104 (8800) his statutes H2706, and his commandments H4687, and his judgments H4941, and to hearken H8085 (8800) unto his voice H6963:
026:018 And the LORD H3068 hath avouched H0559 (8689) thee this day H3117 to be his peculiar H5459 people H5971, as he hath promised H1696 (8765) thee, and that [thou] shouldest keep H8104 (8800) all his commandments H4687;
026:019 And to make H5414 (8800) thee high H5945 above all nations H1471 which he hath made H6213 (8804), in praise H8416, and in name H8034, and in honour H8597; and that thou mayest be an holy H6918 people H5971 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, as he hath spoken H1696 (8765).
027:001 ¶ And Moses H4872 with the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 commanded H6680 (8762) the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Keep H8104 (8800) all the commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117.
027:002 And it shall be on the day H3117 when ye shall pass over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383 unto the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, that thou shalt set thee up H6965 (8689) great H1419 stones H0068, and plaister H7874 (8804) them with plaister H7875:
027:003 And thou shalt write H3789 (8804) upon them all the words H1697 of this law H8451, when thou art passed over H5674 (8800), that thou mayest go in H0935 (8799) unto the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee, a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706; as the LORD H3068 God H0430 of thy fathers H0001 hath promised H1696 (8765) thee.
027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383, [that] ye shall set up H6965 (8686) these stones H0068, which I command H6680 (8764) you this day H3117, in mount H2022 Ebal H5858, and thou shalt plaister H7875 them with plaister H7874 (8804).
027:005 And there shalt thou build H1129 (8804) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, an altar H4196 of stones H0068: thou shalt not lift up H5130 (8686) [any] iron H1270 [tool] upon them.
027:006 Thou shalt build H1129 (8799) the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 of whole H8003 stones H0068: and thou shalt offer H5927 (8689) burnt offerings H5930 thereon unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430:
027:007 And thou shalt offer H2076 (8804) peace offerings H8002, and shalt eat H0398 (8804) there, and rejoice H8055 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
027:008 And thou shalt write H3789 (8804) upon the stones H0068 all the words H1697 of this law H8451 very H3190 (8687) plainly H0874 (8761).
027:009 And Moses H4872 and the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 spake H1696 (8762) unto all Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Take heed H5535 (8685), and hearken H8085 (8798), O Israel H3478; this day H3117 thou art become H1961 (8738) the people H5971 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and do H6213 (8804) his commandments H4687 and his statutes H2706, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117.
027:011 And Moses H4872 charged H6680 (8762) the people H5971 the same day H3117, saying H0559 (8800),
027:012 These shall stand H5975 (8799) upon mount H2022 Gerizim H1630 to bless H1288 (8763) the people H5971, when ye are come over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383; Simeon H8095, and Levi H3878, and Judah H3063, and Issachar H3485, and Joseph H3130, and Benjamin H1144:
027:013 And these shall stand H5975 (8799) upon mount H2022 Ebal H5858 to curse H7045; Reuben H7205, Gad H1410, and Asher H0836, and Zebulun H2074, Dan H1835, and Naphtali H5321.
027:014 And the Levites H3881 shall speak H6030 (8804), and say H0559 (8804) unto all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 with a loud H7311 (8802) voice H6963,

028:001 ¶ And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken H8085 (8799) diligently H8085 (8800) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to observe H8104 (8800) [and] to do H6213 (8800) all his commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will set H5414 (8804) thee on high H5945 above all nations H1471 of the earth H0776:
028:002 And all these blessings H1293 shall come H0935 (8804) on thee, and overtake H5381 (8689) thee, if thou shalt hearken H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
028:003 Blessed H1288 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] in the city H5892, and blessed H1288 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] in the field H7704.

028:007 The LORD H3068 shall cause H5414 (8799) thine enemies H0341 (8802) that rise up H6965 (8801) against thee to be smitten H5062 (8737) before thy face H6440: they shall come out H3318 (8799) against thee one H0259 way H1870, and flee H5127 (8799) before H6440 thee seven H7651 ways H1870.
028:008 The LORD H3068 shall command H6680 (8762) the blessing H1293 upon thee in thy storehouses H0618, and in all that thou settest H4916 thine hand H3027 unto; and he shall bless H1288 (8765) thee in the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) thee.
028:009 The LORD H3068 shall establish H6965 (8686) thee an holy H6918 people H5971 unto himself, as he hath sworn H7650 (8738) unto thee, if thou shalt keep H8104 (8799) the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and walk H1980 (8804) in his ways H1870.
028:010 And all people H5971 of the earth H0776 shall see H7200 (8804) that thou art called H7121 (8738) by the name H8034 of the LORD H3068; and they shall be afraid H3372 (8804) of thee.
028:011 And the LORD H3068 shall make thee plenteous H3498 (8689) in goods H2896, in the fruit H6529 of thy body H0990, and in the fruit H6529 of thy cattle H0929, and in the fruit H6529 of thy ground H0127, in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) thee.
028:012 The LORD H3068 shall open H6605 (8799) unto thee his good H2896 treasure H0214, the heaven H8064 to give H5414 (8800) the rain H4306 unto thy land H0776 in his season H6256, and to bless H1288 (8763) all the work H4639 of thine hand H3027: and thou shalt lend H3867 (8689) unto many H7227 nations H1471, and thou shalt not borrow H3867 (8799).
028:013 And the LORD H3068 shall make H5414 (8804) thee the head H7218, and not the tail H2180; and thou shalt be above only H4605, and thou shalt not be beneath H4295; if that thou hearken H8085 (8799) unto the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, to observe H8104 (8800) and to do H6213 (8800) [them]:
028:014 And thou shalt not go aside H5493 (8799) from any of the words H1697 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, [to] the right hand H3225, or [to] the left H8040, to go H3212 (8800) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to serve H5647 (8800) them.
028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to observe H8104 (8800) to do H6213 (8800) all his commandments H4687 and his statutes H2708 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117; that all these curses H7045 shall come H0935 (8804) upon thee, and overtake H5381 (8689) thee:
028:016 Cursed H0779 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] in the city H5892, and cursed H0779 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] in the field H7704.
028:017 Cursed H0779 (8803) [shall be] thy basket H2935 and thy store H4863.
028:018 Cursed H0779 (8803) [shall be] the fruit H6529 of thy body H0990, and the fruit H6529 of thy land H0127, the increase H7698 of thy kine H0504, and the flocks H6251 of thy sheep H6629.
028:019 Cursed H0779 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in H0935 (8800), and cursed H0779 (8803) [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out H3318 (8800).
028:020 The LORD H3068 shall send H7971 (8762) upon thee cursing H3994, vexation H4103, and rebuke H4045, in all that thou settest H4916 thine hand H3027 unto for to do H6213 (8799), until thou be destroyed H8045 (8736), and until thou perish H0006 (8800) quickly H4118; because H6440 of the wickedness H7455 of thy doings H4611, whereby thou hast forsaken H5800 (8804) me.
028:021 The LORD H3068 shall make the pestilence H1698 cleave H1692 (8686) unto thee, until he have consumed H3615 (8763) thee from off the land H0127, whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
028:022 The LORD H3068 shall smite H5221 (8686) thee with a consumption H7829, and with a fever H6920, and with an inflammation H1816, and with an extreme burning H2746, and with the sword H2719, and with blasting H7711, and with mildew H3420; and they shall pursue H7291 (8804) thee until thou perish H0006 (8800).
028:023 And thy heaven H8064 that [is] over thy head H7218 shall be brass H5178, and the earth H0776 that is under thee [shall be] iron H1270.
028:024 The LORD H3068 shall make H5414 (8799) the rain H4306 of thy land H0776 powder H0080 and dust H6083: from heaven H8064 shall it come down H3381 (8799) upon thee, until thou be destroyed H8045 (8736).
028:025 The LORD H3068 shall cause H5414 (8799) thee to be smitten H5062 (8737) before H6440 thine enemies H0341 (8802): thou shalt go out H3318 (8799) one H0259 way H1870 against them, and flee H5127 (8799) seven H7651 ways H1870 before H6440 them: and shalt be removed H2189 into all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776.
028:026 And thy carcase H5038 shall be meat H3978 unto all fowls H5775 of the air H8064, and unto the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776, and no man shall fray [them] away H2729 (8688).
028:027 The LORD H3068 will smite H5221 (8686) thee with the botch H7822 of Egypt H4714, and with the emerods H2914 (8675) H6076, and with the scab H1618, and with the itch H2775, whereof thou canst H3201 (8799) not be healed H7495 (8736).
028:028 The LORD H3068 shall smite H5221 (8686) thee with madness H7697, and blindness H5788, and astonishment H8541 of heart H3824:
028:029 And thou shalt grope H4959 (8764) at noonday H6672, as the blind H5787 gropeth H4959 (8762) in darkness H0653, and thou shalt not prosper H6743 (8686) in thy ways H1870: and thou shalt be only oppressed H6231 (8803) and spoiled H1497 (8803) evermore H3117, and no man shall save H3467 (8688) [thee].
028:030 Thou shalt betroth H0781 (8762) a wife H0802, and another H0312 man H0376 shall lie H7901 (8799) (8675) H7693 (8799) with her: thou shalt build H1129 (8799) an house H1004, and thou shalt not dwell H3427 (8799) therein: thou shalt plant H5193 (8799) a vineyard H3754, and shalt not gather the grapes H2490 (8762) thereof.
028:031 Thine ox H7794 [shall be] slain H2873 (8803) before thine eyes H5869, and thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) thereof: thine ass H2543 [shall be] violently taken away H1497 (8803) from before thy face H6440, and shall not be restored H7725 (8799) to thee: thy sheep H6629 [shall be] given H5414 (8803) unto thine enemies H0341 (8802), and thou shalt have none to rescue H3467 (8688) [them].
028:032 Thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323 [shall be] given H5414 (8803) unto another H0312 people H5971, and thine eyes H5869 shall look H7200 (8802), and fail H3616 [with longing] for them all the day H3117 long: and [there shall be] no might H0410 in thine hand H3027.
028:033 The fruit H6529 of thy land H0127, and all thy labours H3018, shall a nation H5971 which thou knowest H3045 (8804) not eat up H0398 (8799); and thou shalt be only oppressed H6231 (8803) and crushed H7533 (8803) alway H3117:
028:034 So that thou shalt be mad H7696 (8794) for the sight H4758 of thine eyes H5869 which thou shalt see H7200 (8799).
028:035 The LORD H3068 shall smite H5221 (8686) thee in the knees H1290, and in the legs H7785, with a sore H7451 botch H7822 that cannot H3201 (8799) be healed H7495 (8736), from the sole H3709 of thy foot H7272 unto the top of thy head H6936.
028:036 The LORD H3068 shall bring H3212 (8686) thee, and thy king H4428 which thou shalt set H6965 (8686) over thee, unto a nation H1471 which neither thou nor thy fathers H0001 have known H3045 (8804); and there shalt thou serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430, wood H6086 and stone H0068.
028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment H8047, a proverb H4912, and a byword H8148, among all nations H5971 whither the LORD H3068 shall lead H5090 (8762) thee.
028:038 Thou shalt carry H3318 much H7227 seed H2233 out H3318 (8686) into the field H7704, and shalt gather H0622 [but] little H4592 in H0622 (8799); for the locust H0697 shall consume H2628 (8799) it.
028:039 Thou shalt plant H5193 (8799) vineyards H3754, and dress H5647 (8804) [them], but shalt neither drink H8354 (8799) [of] the wine H3196, nor gather H0103 (8799) [the grapes]; for the worms H8438 shall eat H0398 (8799) them.
028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees H2132 throughout all thy coasts H1366, but thou shalt not anoint H5480 (8799) [thyself] with the oil H8081; for thine olive H2132 shall cast H5394 (8799) [his fruit].
028:041 Thou shalt beget H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628.
028:042 All thy trees H6086 and fruit H6529 of thy land H0127 shall the locust H6767 consume H3423 (8762).
028:043 The stranger H1616 that [is] within H7130 thee shall get up H5927 (8799) above thee very H4605 high H4605; and thou shalt come down H3381 (8799) very H4295 low H4295.
028:044 He shall lend H3867 (8686) to thee, and thou shalt not lend H3867 (8686) to him: he shall be the head H7218, and thou shalt be the tail H2180.
028:045 Moreover all these curses H7045 shall come H0935 (8804) upon thee, and shall pursue H7291 (8804) thee, and overtake H5381 (8689) thee, till thou be destroyed H8045 (8736); because thou hearkenedst H8085 (8804) not unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687 and his statutes H2708 which he commanded H6680 (8765) thee:
028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign H0226 and for a wonder H4159, and upon thy seed H2233 for H5704 ever H5769.
028:047 Because thou servedst H5647 (8804) not the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with joyfulness H8057, and with gladness H2898 of heart H3824, for the abundance H7230 of all [things];
028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve H5647 (8804) thine enemies H0341 (8802) which the LORD H3068 shall send H7971 (8762) against thee, in hunger H7458, and in thirst H6772, and in nakedness H5903, and in want H2640 of all [things]: and he shall put H5414 (8804) a yoke H5923 of iron H1270 upon thy neck H6677, until he have destroyed H8045 (8687) thee.
028:049 The LORD H3068 shall bring H5375 (8799) a nation H1471 against thee from far H7350, from the end H7097 of the earth H0776, [as swift] as the eagle H5404 flieth H1675 (8799); a nation H1471 whose tongue H3956 thou shalt not understand H8085 (8799);
028:050 A nation H1471 of fierce H5794 countenance H6440, which shall not regard H5375 (8799) the person H6440 of the old H2205, nor shew favour H2603 (8799) to the young H5288:
028:051 And he shall eat H0398 (8804) the fruit H6529 of thy cattle H0929, and the fruit H6529 of thy land H0127, until thou be destroyed H8045 (8736): which [also] shall not leave H7604 (8686) thee [either] corn H1715, wine H8492, or oil H3323, [or] the increase H7698 of thy kine H0504, or flocks H6251 of thy sheep H6629, until he have destroyed H0006 (8687) thee.
028:052 And he shall besiege H6887 (8689) thee in all thy gates H8179, until thy high H1364 and fenced H1219 (8803) walls H2346 come down H3381 (8800), wherein H2004 thou trustedst H0982 (8802), throughout all thy land H0776: and he shall besiege H6887 (8689) thee in all thy gates H8179 throughout all thy land H0776, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) thee.
028:053 And thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) the fruit H6529 of thine own body H0990, the flesh H1320 of thy sons H1121 and of thy daughters H1323, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) thee, in the siege H4692, and in the straitness H4689, wherewith thine enemies H0341 (8802) shall distress H6693 (8686) thee:
028:054 [So that] the man H0376 [that is] tender H7390 among you, and very H3966 delicate H6028, his eye H5869 shall be evil H3415 (8799) toward his brother H0251, and toward the wife H0802 of his bosom H2436, and toward the remnant H3499 of his children H1121 which he shall leave H3498 (8686):
028:055 So that he will not give H5414 (8800) to any H0259 of them of the flesh H1320 of his children H1121 whom he shall eat H0398 (8799): because he hath nothing left H7604 (8689) him in the siege H4692, and in the straitness H4689, wherewith thine enemies H0341 (8802) shall distress H6693 (8686) thee in all thy gates H8179.
028:056 The tender H7390 and delicate H6028 woman among you, which would not adventure H5254 (8765) to set H3322 (8687) the sole H3709 of her foot H7272 upon the ground H0776 for delicateness H6026 (8692) and tenderness H7391, her eye H5869 shall be evil H3415 (8799) toward the husband H0376 of her bosom H2436, and toward her son H1121, and toward her daughter H1323,
028:057 And toward her young one H7988 that cometh out H3318 (8802) from between her feet H7272, and toward her children H1121 which she shall bear H3205 (8799): for she shall eat H0398 (8799) them for want H2640 of all [things] secretly H5643 in the siege H4692 and straitness H4689, wherewith thine enemy H0341 (8802) shall distress H6693 (8686) thee in thy gates H8179.
028:058 If thou wilt not observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) all the words H1697 of this law H8451 that are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612, that thou mayest fear H3372 (8800) this glorious H3513 (8737) and fearful H3372 (8737) name H8034, THE LORD H3068 THY GOD H0430;
028:059 Then the LORD H3068 will make H6381 thy plagues H4347 wonderful H6381 (8689), and the plagues H4347 of thy seed H2233, [even] great H1419 plagues H4347, and of long continuance H0539 (8737), and sore H7451 sicknesses H2483, and of long continuance H0539 (8737).
028:060 Moreover he will bring H7725 (8689) upon thee all the diseases H4064 of Egypt H4714, which thou wast afraid H3025 (8804) of H6440; and they shall cleave H1692 (8804) unto thee.
028:061 Also every sickness H2483, and every plague H4347, which [is] not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of this law H8451, them will the LORD H3068 bring H5927 (8686) upon thee, until thou be destroyed H8045 (8736).
028:062 And ye shall be left H7604 (8738) few H4592 in number H4962, whereas H0834 ye were as the stars H3556 of heaven H8064 for multitude H7230; because thou wouldest not obey H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
028:063 And it shall come to pass, [that] as the LORD H3068 rejoiced H7797 (8804) over you to do you good H3190 (8687), and to multiply H7235 (8687) you; so the LORD H3068 will rejoice H7797 (8799) over you to destroy H0006 (8687) you, and to bring you to nought H8045 (8687); and ye shall be plucked H5255 (8738) from off the land H0127 whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
028:064 And the LORD H3068 shall scatter H6327 (8689) thee among all people H5971, from the one end H7097 of the earth H0776 even unto the other H7097; and there thou shalt serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430, which neither thou nor thy fathers H0001 have known H3045 (8804), [even] wood H6086 and stone H0068.
028:065 And among these H1992 nations H1471 shalt thou find no ease H7280 (8686), neither shall the sole H3709 of thy foot H7272 have rest H4494: but the LORD H3068 shall give H5414 (8804) thee there a trembling H7268 heart H3820, and failing H3631 of eyes H5869, and sorrow H1671 of mind H5315:
028:066 And thy life H2416 shall hang H8511 (8803) in doubt before H5048 thee; and thou shalt fear H6342 (8804) day H3119 and night H3915, and shalt have none assurance H0539 (8686) of thy life H2416:
028:067 In the morning H1242 thou shalt say H0559 (8799), Would God it were H5414 (8799) even H6153! and at even H6153 thou shalt say H0559 (8799), Would God it were H5414 (8799) morning H1242! for the fear H6343 of thine heart H3824 wherewith thou shalt fear H6342 (8799), and for the sight H4758 of thine eyes H5869 which thou shalt see H7200 (8799).
028:068 And the LORD H3068 shall bring H7725 thee into Egypt H4714 again H7725 (8689) with ships H0591, by the way H1870 whereof I spake H0559 (8804) unto thee, Thou shalt see H7200 (8800) it no more again H3254 (8686): and there ye shall be sold H4376 (8694) unto your enemies H0341 (8802) for bondmen H5650 and bondwomen H8198, and no man shall buy H7069 (8802) [you].
029:001 ¶ These [are] the words H1697 of the covenant H1285, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 to make H3772 (8800) with the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in the land H0776 of Moab H4124, beside the covenant H1285 which he made H3772 (8804) with them in Horeb H2722.
029:002 And Moses H4872 called H7121 (8799) unto all Israel H3478, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye have seen H7200 (8804) all that the LORD H3068 did H6213 (8804) before your eyes H5869 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 unto Pharaoh H6547, and unto all his servants H5650, and unto all his land H0776;
029:003 The great H1419 temptations H4531 which thine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804), the signs H0226, and those great H1419 miracles H4159:
029:004 Yet the LORD H3068 hath not given H5414 (8804) you an heart H3820 to perceive H3045 (8800), and eyes H5869 to see H7200 (8800), and ears H0241 to hear H8085 (8800), unto this day H3117.
029:005 And I have led H3212 (8686) you forty H0705 years H8141 in the wilderness H4057: your clothes H8008 are not waxen old H1086 (8804) upon you, and thy shoe H5275 is not waxen old H1086 (8804) upon thy foot H7272.
029:006 Ye have not eaten H0398 (8804) bread H3899, neither have ye drunk H8354 (8804) wine H3196 or strong drink H7941: that ye might know H3045 (8799) that I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
029:007 And when ye came H0935 (8799) unto this place H4725, Sihon H5511 the king H4428 of Heshbon H2809, and Og H5747 the king H4428 of Bashan H1316, came out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) us unto battle H4421, and we smote H5221 (8686) them:
029:008 And we took H3947 (8799) their land H0776, and gave H5414 (8799) it for an inheritance H5159 unto the Reubenites H7206, and to the Gadites H1425, and to the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4520.
029:009 Keep H8104 (8804) therefore the words H1697 of this covenant H1285, and do H6213 (8804) them, that ye may prosper H7919 (8686) in all that ye do H6213 (8799).
029:010 Ye stand H5324 (8737) this day H3117 all of you before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430; your captains H7218 of your tribes H7626, your elders H2205, and your officers H7860 (8802), [with] all the men H0376 of Israel H3478,
029:011 Your little ones H2945, your wives H0802, and thy stranger H1616 that [is] in H7130 thy camp H4264, from the hewer H2404 (8802) of thy wood H6086 unto the drawer H7579 (8802) of thy water H4325:
029:012 That thou shouldest enter H5674 (8800) into covenant H1285 with the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and into his oath H0423, which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 maketh H3772 (8802) with thee this day H3117:
029:013 That he may establish H6965 (8687) thee to day H3117 for a people H5971 unto himself, and [that] he may be unto thee a God H0430, as he hath said H1696 (8765) unto thee, and as he hath sworn H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, to Abraham H0085, to Isaac H3327, and to Jacob H3290.
029:014 Neither with you only do I make H3772 (8802) this covenant H1285 and this oath H0423;
029:015 But with [him] that standeth H5975 (8802) here with us this H3426 day H3117 before H6440 the LORD H3068 our God H0430, and also with [him] that [is] not here with us this day H3117:
029:016 (For ye know H3045 (8804) how we have dwelt H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; and how we came H5674 (8804) through H7130 the nations H1471 which ye passed by H5674 (8804);
029:017 And ye have seen H7200 (8799) their abominations H8251, and their idols H1544, wood H6086 and stone H0068, silver H3701 and gold H2091, which [were] among them:)
029:018 Lest there should be H3426 among you man H0376, or woman H0802, or family H4940, or tribe H7626, whose heart H3824 turneth away H6437 (8802) this day H3117 from the LORD H3068 our God H0430, to go H3212 (8800) [and] serve H5647 (8800) the gods H0430 of these nations H1471; lest there should be H3426 among you a root H8328 that beareth H6509 (8802) gall H7219 and wormwood H3939;
029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of this curse H0423, that he bless H1288 (8694) himself in his heart H3824, saying H0559 (8800), I shall have peace H7965, though H3588 I walk H3212 (8799) in the imagination H8307 of mine heart H3820, to add H5595 (8800) drunkenness H7302 to thirst H6771:
029:020 The LORD H3068 will H0014 (8799) not spare H5545 (8800) him, but then the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 and his jealousy H7068 shall smoke H6225 (8799) against that man H0376, and all the curses H0423 that are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612 shall lie H7257 (8804) upon him, and the LORD H3068 shall blot out H4229 (8804) his name H8034 from under heaven H8064.
029:021 And the LORD H3068 shall separate H0914 (8689) him unto evil H7451 out of all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, according to all the curses H0423 of the covenant H1285 that are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612 of the law H8451:
029:022 So that the generation H1755 to come H0314 of your children H1121 that shall rise up H6965 (8799) after H0310 you, and the stranger H5237 that shall come H0935 (8799) from a far H7350 land H0776, shall say H0559 (8804), when they see H7200 (8804) the plagues H4347 of that land H0776, and the sicknesses H8463 which the LORD H3068 hath laid H2470 (8765) upon it;
029:023 [And that] the whole land H0776 thereof [is] brimstone H1614, and salt H4417, [and] burning H8316, [that] it is not sown H2232 (8735), nor beareth H6779 (8686), nor any grass H6212 groweth H5927 (8799) therein, like the overthrow H4114 of Sodom H5467, and Gomorrah H6017, Admah H0126, and Zeboim H6636, which the LORD H3068 overthrew H2015 (8804) in his anger H0639, and in his wrath H2534:
029:024 Even all nations H1471 shall say H0559 (8804), Wherefore hath the LORD H3068 done H6213 (8804) thus unto this land H0776? what [meaneth] the heat H2750 of this great H1419 anger H0639?
029:025 Then men shall say H0559 (8804), Because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, which he made H3772 (8804) with them when he brought them forth H3318 (8687) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714:
029:026 For they went H3212 (8799) and served H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, and worshipped H7812 (8691) them, gods H0430 whom they knew H3045 (8804) not, and [whom] he had not given H2505 (8804) unto them:
029:027 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against this land H0776, to bring H0935 (8687) upon it all the curses H7045 that are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612:
029:028 And the LORD H3068 rooted H5428 (8799) them out of their land H0127 in anger H0639, and in wrath H2534, and in great H1419 indignation H7110, and cast H7993 (8686) them into another H0312 land H0776, as [it is] this day H3117.
029:029 The secret H5641 (8737) [things belong] unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430: but those [things which are] revealed H1540 (8737) [belong] unto us and to our children H1121 for H5704 ever H5769, that [we] may do H6213 (8800) all the words H1697 of this law H8451.
030:001 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when all these things H1697 are come H0935 (8799) upon thee, the blessing H1293 and the curse H7045, which I have set H5414 (8804) before H6440 thee, and thou shalt call H7725 (8689) [them] to mind H3824 among all the nations H1471, whither the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath driven H5080 (8689) thee,
030:002 And shalt return H7725 (8804) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and shalt obey H8085 (8804) his voice H6963 according to all that I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, thou and thy children H1121, with all thine heart H3824, and with all thy soul H5315;
030:003 That then the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will turn H7725 (8804) thy captivity H7622, and have compassion H7355 (8765) upon thee, and will return H7725 (8804) and gather H6908 (8765) thee from all the nations H5971, whither the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath scattered H6327 (8689) thee.
030:004 If [any] of thine be driven out H5080 (8737) unto the outmost H7097 [parts] of heaven H8064, from thence will the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 gather H6908 (8762) thee, and from thence will he fetch H3947 (8799) thee:
030:005 And the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will bring H0935 (8689) thee into the land H0776 which thy fathers H0001 possessed H3423 (8804), and thou shalt possess H3423 (8804) it; and he will do thee good H3190 (8689), and multiply H7235 (8689) thee above thy fathers H0001.
030:006 And the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will circumcise H4135 (8804) thine heart H3824, and the heart H3824 of thy seed H2233, to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with all thine heart H3824, and with all thy soul H5315, that thou mayest live H2416.
030:007 And the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will put H5414 (8804) all these curses H0423 upon thine enemies H0341 (8802), and on them that hate H8130 (8802) thee, which persecuted H7291 (8804) thee.
030:008 And thou shalt return H7725 (8799) and obey H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, and do H6213 (8804) all his commandments H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117.
030:009 And the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will make thee plenteous H3498 (8689) in every work H4639 of thine hand H3027, in the fruit H6529 of thy body H0990, and in the fruit H6529 of thy cattle H0929, and in the fruit H6529 of thy land H0127, for good H2896: for the LORD H3068 will again H7725 (8799) rejoice H7797 (8800) over thee for good H2896, as he rejoiced H7797 (8804) over thy fathers H0001:
030:010 If thou shalt hearken H8085 (8799) unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687 and his statutes H2708 which are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612 of the law H8451, [and] if thou turn H7725 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 with all thine heart H3824, and with all thy soul H5315.
030:011 For this commandment H4687 which I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117, it [is] not hidden H6381 (8737) from thee, neither [is] it far off H7350.
030:012 It [is] not in heaven H8064, that thou shouldest say H0559 (8800), Who shall go up H5927 (8799) for us to heaven H8064, and bring H3947 (8799) it unto us, that we may hear H8085 (8686) it, and do H6213 (8799) it?
030:013 Neither [is] it beyond H5676 the sea H3220, that thou shouldest say H0559 (8800), Who shall go H5674 (8799) over H5676 the sea H3220 for us, and bring H3947 (8799) it unto us, that we may hear H8085 (8686) it, and do H6213 (8799) it?
030:014 But the word H1697 [is] very H3966 nigh H7138 unto thee, in thy mouth H6310, and in thy heart H3824, that thou mayest do H6213 (8800) it.
030:015 See H7200 (8798), I have set H5414 (8804) before H6440 thee this day H3117 life H2416 and good H2896, and death H4194 and evil H7451;
030:016 In that I command H6680 (8764) thee this day H3117 to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, to walk H3212 (8800) in his ways H1870, and to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687 and his statutes H2708 and his judgments H4941, that thou mayest live H2421 (8804) and multiply H7235 (8804): and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall bless H1288 (8765) thee in the land H0776 whither thou goest H0935 (8802) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
030:017 But if thine heart H3824 turn away H6437 (8799), so that thou wilt not hear H8085 (8799), but shalt be drawn away H5080 (8738), and worship H7812 (8694) other H0312 gods H0430, and serve H5647 (8804) them;
030:018 I denounce H5046 (8689) unto you this day H3117, that ye shall surely H0006 (8800) perish H0006 (8799), [and that] ye shall not prolong H0748 (8686) [your] days H3117 upon the land H0127, whither thou passest over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 to go H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) it.
030:019 I call H5749 heaven H8064 and earth H0776 to record H5749 (8689) this day H3117 against you, [that] I have set H5414 (8804) before H6440 you life H2416 and death H4194, blessing H1293 and cursing H7045: therefore choose H0977 (8804) life H2416, that both thou and thy seed H2233 may live H2421 (8799):
030:020 That thou mayest love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, [and] that thou mayest obey H8085 (8800) his voice H6963, and that thou mayest cleave H1692 (8800) unto him: for he [is] thy life H2416, and the length H0753 of thy days H3117: that thou mayest dwell H3427 (8800) in the land H0127 which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto thy fathers H0001, to Abraham H0085, to Isaac H3327, and to Jacob H3290, to give H5414 (8800) them.
031:001 ¶ And Moses H4872 went H3212 (8799) and spake H1696 (8762) these words H1697 unto all Israel H3478.
031:002 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, I [am] an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 this day H3117; I can H3201 (8799) no more go out H3318 (8800) and come in H0935 (8800): also the LORD H3068 hath said H0559 (8804) unto me, Thou shalt not go over H5674 (8799) this Jordan H3383.
031:003 The LORD H3068 thy God H0430, he will go over H5674 (8802) before H6440 thee, [and] he will destroy H8045 (8686) these nations H1471 from before H6440 thee, and thou shalt possess H3423 (8804) them: [and] Joshua H3091, he shall go over H5674 (8802) before H6440 thee, as the LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765).
031:004 And the LORD H3068 shall do H6213 (8804) unto them as he did H6213 (8804) to Sihon H5511 and to Og H5747, kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, and unto the land H0776 of them, whom he destroyed H8045 (8689).
031:005 And the LORD H3068 shall give them up H5414 (8804) before your face H6440, that ye may do H6213 (8804) unto them according unto all the commandments H4687 which I have commanded H6680 (8765) you.
031:006 Be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798), fear H3372 (8799) not, nor be afraid H6206 (8799) of them H6440: for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, he [it is] that doth go H1980 (8802) with thee; he will not fail H7503 (8686) thee, nor forsake H5800 (8799) thee.
031:007 And Moses H4872 called H7121 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, and said H0559 (8799) unto him in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478, Be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798): for thou must go H0935 (8799) with this people H5971 unto the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 hath sworn H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit H5157 (8686) it.
031:008 And the LORD H3068, he [it is] that doth go H1980 (8802) before H6440 thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail H7503 (8686) thee, neither forsake H5800 (8799) thee: fear H3372 (8799) not, neither be dismayed H2865 (8735).
031:009 And Moses H4872 wrote H3789 (8799) this law H8451, and delivered H5414 (8799) it unto the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Levi H3878, which bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, and unto all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478.
031:010 And Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), At the end H7093 of [every] seven H7651 years H8141, in the solemnity H4150 of the year H8141 of release H8059, in the feast H2282 of tabernacles H5521,
031:011 When all Israel H3478 is come H0935 (8800) to appear H7200 (8736) before H6440 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 in the place H4725 which he shall choose H0977 (8799), thou shalt read H7121 (8799) this law H8451 before all Israel H3478 in their hearing H0241.
031:012 Gather H6950 the people H5971 together H6950 (8685), men H0582, and women H0802, and children H2945, and thy stranger H1616 that [is] within thy gates H8179, that they may hear H8085 (8799), and that they may learn H3925 (8799), and fear H3372 (8804) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and observe H8104 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) all the words H1697 of this law H8451:
031:013 And [that] their children H1121, which have not known H3045 (8804) [any thing], may hear H8085 (8799), and learn H3925 (8804) to fear H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, as long as H3117 ye live H2416 in the land H0127 whither ye go over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 to possess H3423 (8800) it.
031:014 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Behold, thy days H3117 approach H7126 (8804) that thou must die H4191 (8800): call H7121 (8798) Joshua H3091, and present H3320 (8690) yourselves in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, that I may give him a charge H6680 (8762). And Moses H4872 and Joshua H3091 went H3212 (8799), and presented H3320 (8691) themselves in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
031:015 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) in the tabernacle H0168 in a pillar H5982 of a cloud H6051: and the pillar H5982 of the cloud H6051 stood H5975 (8799) over the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168.
031:016 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Behold, thou shalt sleep H7901 (8802) with thy fathers H0001; and this people H5971 will rise up H6965 (8804), and go a whoring H2181 (8804) after H0310 the gods H0430 of the strangers H5236 of the land H0776, whither they go H0935 (8802) [to be] among H7130 them, and will forsake H5800 (8804) me, and break H6565 (8689) my covenant H1285 which I have made H3772 (8804) with them.
031:017 Then my anger H0639 shall be kindled H2734 (8804) against them in that day H3117, and I will forsake H5800 (8804) them, and I will hide H5641 (8689) my face H6440 from them, and they shall be devoured H0398 (8800), and many H7227 evils H7451 and troubles H6869 shall befall H4672 (8804) them; so that they will say H0559 (8804) in that day H3117, Are not these evils H7451 come H4672 (8804) upon us, because our God H0430 [is] not among H7130 us?
031:018 And I will surely H5641 (8687) hide H5641 (8686) my face H6440 in that day H3117 for all the evils H7451 which they shall have wrought H6213 (8804), in that H3588 they are turned H6437 (8804) unto other H0312 gods H0430.
031:019 Now therefore write H3789 (8798) ye this song H7892 for you, and teach H3925 (8761) it the children H1121 of Israel H3478: put H7760 (8798) it in their mouths H6310, that this song H7892 may be a witness H5707 for me against the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
031:020 For when I shall have brought H0935 (8686) them into the land H0127 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001, that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706; and they shall have eaten H0398 (8804) and filled H7646 (8804) themselves, and waxen fat H1878 (8804); then will they turn H6437 (8804) unto other H0312 gods H0430, and serve H5647 (8804) them, and provoke H5006 (8765) me, and break H6565 (8689) my covenant H1285.
031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many H7227 evils H7451 and troubles H6869 are befallen H4672 (8799) them, that this song H7892 shall testify H6030 (8804) against H6440 them as a witness H5707; for it shall not be forgotten H7911 (8735) out of the mouths H6310 of their seed H2233: for I know H3045 (8804) their imagination H3336 which they go about H6213 (8802), even now H3117, before I have brought H0935 (8686) them into the land H0776 which I sware H7650 (8738).
031:022 Moses H4872 therefore wrote H3789 (8799) this song H7892 the same day H3117, and taught H3925 (8762) it the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
031:023 And he gave Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126 a charge H6680 (8762), and said H0559 (8799), Be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798): for thou shalt bring H0935 (8686) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 into the land H0776 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto them: and I will be with thee.
031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses H4872 had made an end H3615 (8763) of writing H3789 (8800) the words H1697 of this law H8451 in a book H5612, until they were finished H8552 (8800),
031:025 That Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8762) the Levites H3881, which bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
031:026 Take H3947 (8800) this book H5612 of the law H8451, and put H7760 (8804) it in the side H6654 of the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, that it may be there for a witness H5707 against thee.
031:027 For I know H3045 (8804) thy rebellion H4805, and thy stiff H7186 neck H6203: behold, while I am yet alive H2416 with you this day H3117, ye have been rebellious H4784 (8688) against the LORD H3068; and how much more after H0310 my death H4194?
031:028 Gather H6950 (8685) unto me all the elders H2205 of your tribes H7626, and your officers H7860 (8802), that I may speak H1696 (8762) these words H1697 in their ears H0241, and call H5749 heaven H8064 and earth H0776 to record H5749 (8686) against them.
031:029 For I know H3045 (8804) that after H0310 my death H4194 ye will utterly H7843 (8687) corrupt H7843 (8686) [yourselves], and turn aside H5493 (8804) from the way H1870 which I have commanded H6680 (8765) you; and evil H7451 will befall H7122 (8804) you in the latter H0319 days H3117; because ye will do H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, to provoke him to anger H3707 (8687) through the work H4639 of your hands H3027.
031:030 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) in the ears H0241 of all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478 the words H1697 of this song H7892, until they were ended H8552 (8800).
032:001 ¶ Give ear H0238 (8685), O ye heavens H8064, and I will speak H1696 (8762); and hear H8085 (8799), O earth H0776, the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
032:002 My doctrine H3948 shall drop H6201 (8799) as the rain H4306, my speech H0565 shall distil H5140 (8799) as the dew H2919, as the small rain H8164 upon the tender herb H1877, and as the showers H7241 upon the grass H6212:
032:003 Because I will publish H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068: ascribe H3051 (8798) ye greatness H1433 unto our God H0430.
032:004 [He is] the Rock H6697, his work H6467 [is] perfect H8549: for all his ways H1870 [are] judgment H4941: a God H0410 of truth H0530 and without iniquity H5766, just H6662 and right H3477 [is] he.
032:005 They have corrupted H7843 (8765) themselves, their spot H3971 [is] not [the spot] of his children H1121: [they are] a perverse H6141 and crooked H6618 generation H1755.
032:006 Do ye thus requite H1580 (8799) the LORD H3068, O foolish H5036 people H5971 and unwise H2450? [is] not he thy father H0001 [that] hath bought H7069 (8804) thee? hath he not made H6213 (8804) thee, and established H3559 (8787) thee?
032:007 Remember H2142 (8798) the days H3117 of old H5769, consider H0995 (8798) the years H8141 of many H1755 generations H1755: ask H7592 (8798) thy father H0001, and he will shew H5046 (8686) thee; thy elders H2205, and they will tell H0559 (8799) thee.
032:008 When the most High H5945 divided H5157 to the nations H1471 their inheritance H5157 (8687), when he separated H6504 (8687) the sons H1121 of Adam H0120, he set H5324 (8686) the bounds H1367 of the people H5971 according to the number H4557 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
032:009 For the LORD’S H3068 portion H2506 [is] his people H5971; Jacob H3290 [is] the lot H2256 of his inheritance H5159.
032:010 He found H4672 (8799) him in a desert H4057 land H0776, and in the waste H8414 howling H3214 wilderness H3452; he led him about H5437 (8779), he instructed H0995 (8787) him, he kept H5341 (8799) him as the apple H0380 of his eye H5869.
032:011 As an eagle H5404 stirreth up H5782 (8686) her nest H7064, fluttereth H7363 (8762) over her young H1469, spreadeth abroad H6566 (8799) her wings H3671, taketh H3947 (8799) them, beareth H5375 (8799) them on her wings H0084:
032:012 [So] the LORD H3068 alone H0910 did lead H5148 (8686) him, and [there was] no strange H5236 god H0410 with him.
032:013 He made him ride H7392 (8686) on the high places H1116 of the earth H0776, that he might eat H0398 (8799) the increase H8570 of the fields H7704; and he made him to suck H3243 (8686) honey H1706 out of the rock H5553, and oil H8081 out of the flinty H2496 rock H6697;
032:014 Butter H2529 of kine H1241, and milk H2461 of sheep H6629, with fat H2459 of lambs H3733, and rams H0352 of the breed H1121 of Bashan H1316, and goats H6260, with the fat H2459 of kidneys H3629 of wheat H2406; and thou didst drink H8354 (8799) the pure H2561 blood H1818 of the grape H6025.
032:015 But Jeshurun H3484 waxed fat H8080 (8799), and kicked H1163 (8799): thou art waxen fat H8080 (8804), thou art grown thick H5666 (8804), thou art covered H3780 (8804) [with fatness]; then he forsook H5203 (8799) God H0433 [which] made H6213 (8804) him, and lightly esteemed H5034 (8762) the Rock H6697 of his salvation H3444.
032:016 They provoked him to jealousy H7065 (8686) with strange H2114 (8801) [gods], with abominations H8441 provoked they him to anger H3707 (8686).
032:017 They sacrificed H2076 (8799) unto devils H7700, not to God H0433; to gods H0430 whom they knew H3045 (8804) not, to new H2319 [gods that] came H0935 newly H7138 up H0935 (8804), whom your fathers H0001 feared H8175 (8804) not.
032:018 Of the Rock H6697 [that] begat H3205 (8804) thee thou art unmindful H7876 (8799), and hast forgotten H7911 (8799) God H0410 that formed H2342 (8789) thee.
032:019 And when the LORD H3068 saw H7200 (8799) [it], he abhorred H5006 (8799) [them], because of the provoking H3708 of his sons H1121, and of his daughters H1323.
032:020 And he said H0559 (8799), I will hide H5641 (8686) my face H6440 from them, I will see H7200 (8799) what their end H0319 [shall be]: for they [are] a very froward H8419 generation H1755, children H1121 in whom [is] no faith H0529.
032:021 They have moved me to jealousy H7065 (8765) with [that which is] not H3808 God H0410; they have provoked me to anger H3707 (8765) with their vanities H1892: and I will move them to jealousy H7065 (8686) with [those which are] not a people H5971; I will provoke them to anger H3707 (8686) with a foolish H5036 nation H1471.
032:022 For a fire H0784 is kindled H6919 (8804) in mine anger H0639, and shall burn H3344 (8799) unto the lowest H8482 hell H7585, and shall consume H0398 (8799) the earth H0776 with her increase H2981, and set on fire H3857 (8762) the foundations H4144 of the mountains H2022.
032:023 I will heap H5595 (8686) mischiefs H7451 upon them; I will spend H3615 (8762) mine arrows H2671 upon them.
032:024 [They shall be] burnt H4198 with hunger H7458, and devoured H3898 (8803) with burning heat H7565, and with bitter H4815 destruction H6986: I will also send H7971 (8762) the teeth H8127 of beasts H0929 upon them, with the poison H2534 of serpents H2119 (8801) of the dust H6083.
032:025 The sword H2719 without H2351, and terror H0367 within H2315, shall destroy H7921 (8762) both the young man H0970 and the virgin H1330, the suckling H3243 (8802) [also] with the man H0376 of gray hairs H7872.
032:026 I said H0559 (8804), I would scatter them into corners H6284 (8686), I would make the remembrance H2143 of them to cease H7673 (8686) from among men H0582:
032:027 Were it not H3884 that I feared H1481 (8799) the wrath H3708 of the enemy H0341 (8802), lest their adversaries H6862 should behave themselves strangely H5234 (8762), [and] lest they should say H0559 (8799), Our hand H3027 [is] high H7311 (8804), and the LORD H3068 hath not done H6466 (8804) all this.
032:028 For they [are] a nation H1471 void H0006 (8802) of counsel H6098, neither [is there any] understanding H8394 in them.
032:029 O that H3863 they were wise H2449 (8804), [that] they understood H7919 (8686) this, [that] they would consider H0995 (8799) their latter end H0319!
032:030 How should one H0259 chase H7291 (8799) a thousand H0505, and two H8147 put ten H7233 thousand H0505 to flight H5127 (8686), except H3808 their Rock H6697 had sold H4376 (8804) them H3588, and the LORD H3068 had shut them up H5462 (8689)?
032:031 For their rock H6697 [is] not as our Rock H6697, even our enemies H0341 (8802) themselves [being] judges H6414.
032:032 For their vine H1612 [is] of the vine H1612 of Sodom H5467, and of the fields H7709 of Gomorrah H6017: their grapes H6025 [are] grapes H6025 of gall H7219, their clusters H0811 [are] bitter H4846:
032:033 Their wine H3196 [is] the poison H2534 of dragons H8577, and the cruel H0393 venom H7219 of asps H6620.
032:034 [Is] not this laid up in store H3647 (8803) with me, [and] sealed up H2856 (8803) among my treasures H0214?
032:035 To me [belongeth] vengeance H5359, and recompence H8005; their foot H7272 shall slide H4131 (8799) in [due] time H6256: for the day H3117 of their calamity H0343 [is] at hand H7138, and the things that shall come H6264 upon them make haste H2363 (8804).
032:036 For the LORD H3068 shall judge H1777 (8799) his people H5971, and repent H5162 (8691) himself for his servants H5650, when he seeth H7200 (8799) that [their] power H3027 is gone H0235 (8804), and [there is] none H0657 shut up H6113 (8803), or left H5800 (8803).
032:037 And he shall say H0559 (8804), Where [are] their gods H0430, [their] rock H6697 in whom they trusted H2620 (8804),
032:038 Which did eat H0398 (8799) the fat H2459 of their sacrifices H2077, [and] drank H8354 (8799) the wine H3196 of their drink offerings H5257? let them rise up H6965 (8799) and help H5826 (8799) you, [and] be your protection H5643.
032:039 See H7200 (8798) now that I, [even] I, [am] he, and [there is] no god H0430 with me: I kill H4191 (8686), and I make alive H2421 (8762); I wound H4272 (8804), and I heal H7495 (8799): neither [is there any] that can deliver H5337 (8688) out of my hand H3027.
032:040 For I lift up H5375 (8799) my hand H3027 to heaven H8064, and say H0559 (8804), I live H2416 for ever H5769.
032:041 If I whet H8150 (8804) my glittering H1300 sword H2719, and mine hand H3027 take hold H0270 (8799) on judgment H4941; I will render H7725 (8686) vengeance H5359 to mine enemies H6862, and will reward H7999 (8762) them that hate H8130 (8764) me.
032:042 I will make mine arrows H2671 drunk H7937 (8686) with blood H1818, and my sword H2719 shall devour H0398 (8799) flesh H1320; [and that] with the blood H1818 of the slain H2491 and of the captives H7633, from the beginning H7218 of revenges H6546 upon the enemy H0341 (8802).
032:043 Rejoice H7442 (8685), O ye nations H1471, [with] his people H5971: for he will avenge H5358 (8799) the blood H1818 of his servants H5650, and will render H7725 (8686) vengeance H5359 to his adversaries H6862, and will be merciful H3722 (8765) unto his land H0127, [and] to his people H5971.
032:044 And Moses H4872 came H0935 (8799) and spake H1696 (8762) all the words H1697 of this song H7892 in the ears H0241 of the people H5971, he, and Hoshea H1954 the son H1121 of Nun H5126.
032:045 And Moses H4872 made an end H3615 (8762) of speaking H1696 (8763) all these words H1697 to all Israel H3478:
032:046 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Set H7760 (8798) your hearts H3824 unto all the words H1697 which I testify H5749 (8688) among you this day H3117, which ye shall command H6680 (8762) your children H1121 to observe H8104 (8800) to do H6213 (8800), all the words H1697 of this law H8451.
032:047 For it [is] not a vain H7386 thing H1697 for you; because it [is] your life H2416: and through this thing H1697 ye shall prolong H0748 (8686) [your] days H3117 in the land H0127, whither ye go over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 to possess H3423 (8800) it.
032:048 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 that selfsame H6106 day H3117, saying H0559 (8800),
032:049 Get thee up H5927 (8798) into this mountain H2022 Abarim H5682, [unto] mount H2022 Nebo H5015, which [is] in the land H0776 of Moab H4124, that [is] over against H6440 Jericho H3405; and behold H7200 (8798) the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, which I give H5414 (8802) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 for a possession H0272:
032:050 And die H4191 (8798) in the mount H2022 whither thou goest up H5927 (8802), and be gathered H0622 (8735) unto thy people H5971; as Aaron H0175 thy brother H0251 died H4191 (8804) in mount H2022 Hor H2023, and was gathered H0622 (8734) unto his people H5971:
032:051 Because ye trespassed H4603 (8804) against me among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 at the waters H4325 of Meribah-Kadesh H4808 H6946, in the wilderness H4057 of Zin H6790; because ye sanctified H6942 (8765) me not in the midst H8432 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
032:052 Yet thou shalt see H7200 (8799) the land H0776 before [thee]; but thou shalt not go H0935 (8799) thither unto the land H0776 which I give H5414 (8802) the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
033:001 ¶ And this [is] the blessing H1293, wherewith Moses H4872 the man H0376 of God H0430 blessed H1288 (8765) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 before H6440 his death H4194.
033:002 And he said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 came H0935 (8804) from Sinai H5514, and rose up H2224 (8804) from Seir H8165 unto them; he shined forth H3313 (8689) from mount H2022 Paran H6290, and he came H0857 (8804) with ten thousands H7233 of saints H6944: from his right hand H3225 [went] a fiery H0799 (8676) H0784 law H1881 for them.
033:003 Yea H0637, he loved H2245 (8801) the people H5971; all his saints H6918 [are] in thy hand H3027: and they sat down H8497 (8795) at thy feet H7272; [every one] shall receive H5375 (8799) of thy words H1703.
033:004 Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765) us a law H8451, [even] the inheritance H4181 of the congregation H6952 of Jacob H3290.
033:005 And he was king H4428 in Jeshurun H3484, when the heads H7218 of the people H5971 [and] the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 were gathered H0622 (8692) together H3162.
033:006 Let Reuben H7205 live H2421 (8799), and not die H4191 (8799); and let [not] his men H4962 be few H4557.
033:007 And this [is the blessing] of Judah H3063: and he said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798), LORD H3068, the voice H6963 of Judah H3063, and bring H0935 (8686) him unto his people H5971: let his hands H3027 be sufficient H7227 for him; and be thou an help H5828 [to him] from his enemies H6862.
033:008 And of Levi H3878 he said H0559 (8804), [Let] thy Thummim H8550 and thy Urim H0224 [be] with thy holy H2623 one H0376, whom thou didst prove H5254 (8765) at Massah H4532, [and with] whom thou didst strive H7378 (8799) at the waters H4325 of Meribah H4809;
033:009 Who said H0559 (8802) unto his father H0001 and to his mother H0517, I have not seen H7200 (8804) him; neither did he acknowledge H5234 (8689) his brethren H0251, nor knew H3045 (8804) his own children H1121: for they have observed H8104 (8804) thy word H0565, and kept H5341 (8799) thy covenant H1285.
033:010 They shall teach H3384 (8686) Jacob H3290 thy judgments H4941, and Israel H3478 thy law H8451: they shall put H7760 (8799) incense H6988 before H0639 thee, and whole burnt sacrifice H3632 upon thine altar H4196.
033:011 Bless H1288 (8761), LORD H3068, his substance H2428, and accept H7521 (8799) the work H6467 of his hands H3027: smite H4272 (8798) through the loins H4975 of them that rise H6965 (8801) against him, and of them that hate H8130 (8764) him, that they rise H6965 not H4480 again H6965 (8799).
033:012 [And] of Benjamin H1144 he said H0559 (8804), The beloved H3039 of the LORD H3068 shall dwell H7931 (8799) in safety H0983 by him; [and the LORD] shall cover H2653 (8802) him all the day H3117 long, and he shall dwell H7931 (8804) between his shoulders H3802.
033:013 And of Joseph H3130 he said H0559 (8804), Blessed H1288 (8794) of the LORD H3068 [be] his land H0776, for the precious things H4022 of heaven H8064, for the dew H2919, and for the deep H8415 that coucheth beneath H7257 (8802),
033:014 And for the precious H4022 fruits H8393 [brought forth] by the sun H8121, and for the precious things H4022 put forth H1645 by the moon H3391,
033:015 And for the chief things H7218 of the ancient H6924 mountains H2042, and for the precious things H4022 of the lasting H5769 hills H1389,
033:016 And for the precious things H4022 of the earth H0776 and fulness H4393 thereof, and [for] the good will H7522 of him that dwelt H7931 (8802) in the bush H5572: let [the blessing] come H0935 (8799) upon the head H7218 of Joseph H3130, and upon the top of the head H6936 of him [that was] separated H5139 from his brethren H0251.
033:017 His glory H1926 [is like] the firstling H1060 of his bullock H7794, and his horns H7161 [are like] the horns H7161 of unicorns H7214: with them he shall push H5055 (8762) the people H5971 together H3162 to the ends H0657 of the earth H0776: and they [are] the ten thousands H7233 of Ephraim H0669, and they [are] the thousands H0505 of Manasseh H4519.
033:018 And of Zebulun H2074 he said H0559 (8804), Rejoice H8055 (8798), Zebulun H2074, in thy going out H3318 (8800); and, Issachar H3485, in thy tents H0168.
033:019 They shall call H7121 (8799) the people H5971 unto the mountain H2022; there they shall offer H2076 (8799) sacrifices H2077 of righteousness H6664: for they shall suck H3243 (8799) [of] the abundance H8228 of the seas H3220, and [of] treasures H8226 (8803) hid H2934 (8803) in the sand H2344.
033:020 And of Gad H1410 he said H0559 (8804), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] he that enlargeth H7337 (8688) Gad H1410: he dwelleth H7931 (8804) as a lion H3833, and teareth H2963 (8804) the arm H2220 with H0637 the crown of the head H6936.
033:021 And he provided H7200 (8799) the first part H7225 for himself, because there, [in] a portion H2513 of the lawgiver H2710 (8781), [was he] seated H5603 (8803); and he came H0857 (8799) with the heads H7218 of the people H5971, he executed H6213 (8804) the justice H6666 of the LORD H3068, and his judgments H4941 with Israel H3478.
033:022 And of Dan H1835 he said H0559 (8804), Dan H1835 [is] a lion’s H0738 whelp H1482: he shall leap H2187 (8762) from Bashan H1316.
033:023 And of Naphtali H5321 he said H0559 (8804), O Naphtali H5321, satisfied H7649 with favour H7522, and full H4392 with the blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068: possess H3423 (8798) thou the west H3220 and the south H1864.
033:024 And of Asher H0836 he said H0559 (8804), [Let] Asher H0836 [be] blessed H1288 (8803) with children H1121; let him be acceptable H7521 (8803) to his brethren H0251, and let him dip H2881 (8802) his foot H7272 in oil H8081.
033:025 Thy shoes H4515 [shall be] iron H1270 and brass H5178; and as thy days H3117, [so shall] thy strength H1679 [be].
033:026 [There is] none like unto the God H0410 of Jeshurun H3484, [who] rideth H7392 (8802) upon the heaven H8064 in thy help H5828, and in his excellency H1346 on the sky H7834.
033:027 The eternal H6924 God H0430 [is thy] refuge H4585, and underneath [are] the everlasting H5769 arms H2220: and he shall thrust out H1644 (8762) the enemy H0341 (8802) from before H6440 thee; and shall say H0559 (8799), Destroy H8045 (8685) [them].
033:028 Israel H3478 then shall dwell H7931 (8799) in safety H0983 alone H0910: the fountain H5869 of Jacob H3290 [shall be] upon a land H0776 of corn H1715 and wine H8492; also his heavens H8064 shall drop down H6201 (8799) dew H2919.
033:029 Happy H0835 [art] thou, O Israel H3478: who [is] like unto thee, O people H5971 saved H3467 (8737) by the LORD H3068, the shield H4043 of thy help H5828, and who [is] the sword H2719 of thy excellency H1346! and thine enemies H0341 (8802) shall be found liars H3584 (8735) unto thee; and thou shalt tread H1869 (8799) upon their high places H1116.
034:001 ¶ And Moses H4872 went up H5927 (8799) from the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 unto the mountain H2022 of Nebo H5015, to the top H7218 of Pisgah H6449, that [is] over against H6440 Jericho H3405. And the LORD H3068 shewed H7200 (8686) him all the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, unto Dan H1835,
034:002 And all Naphtali H5321, and the land H0776 of Ephraim H0669, and Manasseh H4519, and all the land H0776 of Judah H3063, unto the utmost H0314 sea H3220,
034:003 And the south H5045, and the plain H3603 of the valley H1237 of Jericho H3405, the city H5892 of palm trees H8558 (8677) H5899, unto Zoar H6820.
034:004 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, This [is] the land H0776 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto Abraham H0085, unto Isaac H3327, and unto Jacob H3290, saying H0559 (8800), I will give H5414 (8799) it unto thy seed H2233: I have caused thee to see H7200 (8689) [it] with thine eyes H5869, but thou shalt not go over H5674 (8799) thither.
034:005 So Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 died H4191 (8799) there in the land H0776 of Moab H4124, according to the word H6310 of the LORD H3068.
034:006 And he buried H6912 (8799) him in a valley H1516 in the land H0776 of Moab H4124, over against H4136 Bethpeor H1047: but no man H0376 knoweth H3045 (8804) of his sepulchre H6900 unto this day H3117.
034:007 And Moses H4872 [was] an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he died H4194: his eye H5869 was not dim H3543 (8804), nor his natural force H3893 abated H5127 (8804).
034:008 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 wept H1058 (8799) for Moses H4872 in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 thirty H7970 days H3117: so the days H3117 of weeping H1065 [and] mourning H0060 for Moses H4872 were ended H8552 (8799).
034:009 And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126 was full H4392 of the spirit H7307 of wisdom H2451; for Moses H4872 had laid H5564 (8804) his hands H3027 upon him: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto him, and did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
034:010 And there arose H6965 (8804) not a prophet H5030 since H5750 in Israel H3478 like unto Moses H4872, whom the LORD H3068 knew H3045 (8804) face H6440 to face H6440,
034:011 In all the signs H0226 and the wonders H4159, which the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8804) him to do H6213 (8800) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 to Pharaoh H6547, and to all his servants H5650, and to all his land H0776,
034:012 And in all that mighty H2389 hand H3027, and in all the great H1419 terror H4172 which Moses H4872 shewed H6213 (8804) in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478.
