001:001 ¶ In the beginning H7225 God H0430 created H1254 (8804) H0853 the heaven H8064 and H0853 the earth H0776.
001:002 And the earth H0776 was H1961 (8804) without form H8414, and void H0922; and darkness H2822 [was] upon the face H6440 of the deep H8415. And the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 moved H7363 (8764) upon H5921 the face H6440 of the waters H4325.
001:003 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let there be H1961 (8799) light H0216: and there was light H0216.
001:004 And God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) H0853 the light H0216, that H3588 [it was] good H2896: and God H0430 divided H0914 (8686) H0996 the light H0216 from H0996 the darkness H2822.
001:005 And God H0430 called H7121 (8799) the light H0216 Day H3117, and the darkness H2822 he called H7121 (8804) Night H3915. And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the first H0259 day H3117.
001:006 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let there be a firmament H7549 in the midst H8432 of the waters H4325, and let it divide H0914 (8688) the waters H4325 from the waters H4325.
001:007 And God H0430 made H6213 (8799) the firmament H7549, and divided H0914 (8686) the waters H4325 which H0834 [were] under H8478 the firmament H7549 from the waters H4325 which H0834 [were] above H5921 the firmament H7549: and it was so H3651.
001:008 And God H0430 called H7121 (8799) the firmament H7549 Heaven H8064. And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the second H8145 day H3117.
001:009 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let the waters H4325 under the heaven H8064 be gathered together H6960 (8735) unto H0413 one H0259 place H4725, and let the dry H3004 [land] appear H7200 (8735): and it was so.
001:010 And God H0430 called H7121 (8799) the dry H3004 [land] Earth H0776; and the gathering together H4723 of the waters H4325 called H7121 (8804) he Seas H3220: and God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] good H2896.
001:011 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let the earth H0776 bring forth H1876 (8686) grass H1877, the herb H6212 yielding H2232 (8688) seed H2233, [and] the fruit H6529 tree H6086 yielding H6213 (8802) fruit H6529 after his kind H4327, whose H0834 seed H2233 [is] in itself, upon the earth H0776: and it was so.
001:012 And the earth H0776 brought forth H3318 (8686) grass H1877, [and] herb H6212 yielding H2232 (8688) seed H2233 after his kind H4327, and the tree H6086 yielding H6213 (8802) fruit H6529, whose seed H2233 [was] in itself, after his kind H4327: and God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] good H2896.
001:013 And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the third H7992 day H3117.
001:014 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let there be lights H3974 in the firmament H7549 of the heaven H8064 to divide H0914 (8687) the day H3117 from the night H3915; and let them be for signs H0226, and for seasons H4150, and for days H3117, and years H8141:
001:015 And let them be for lights H3974 in the firmament H7549 of the heaven H8064 to give light H0215 (8687) upon the earth H0776: and it was so.
001:016 And God H0430 made H6213 (8799) two H8147 great H1419 lights H3974; the greater H1419 light H3974 to rule H4475 the day H3117, and the lesser H6996 light H3974 to rule H4475 the night H3915: [he made] the stars H3556 also.
001:017 And God H0430 set H5414 (8799) them in the firmament H7549 of the heaven H8064 to give light H0215 (8687) upon the earth H0776,
001:018 And to rule H4910 (8800) over the day H3117 and over the night H3915, and to divide H0914 (8687) the light H0216 from the darkness H2822: and God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] good H2896.
001:019 And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the fourth H7243 day H3117.
001:020 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let the waters H4325 bring forth abundantly H8317 (8799) the moving creature H8318 that hath H5315 life H2416, and fowl H5775 [that] may fly H5774 (8787) above H5921 the earth H0776 in the open H6440 firmament H7549 of heaven H8064.
001:021 And God H0430 created H1254 (8799) great H1419 whales H8577, and every living H2416 creature H5315 that moveth H7430 (8802), which the waters H4325 brought forth abundantly H8317 (8804), after their kind H4327, and every winged H3671 fowl H5775 after his kind H4327: and God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] good H2896.
001:022 And God H0430 blessed H1288 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Be fruitful H6509 (8798), and multiply H7235 (8798), and fill H4390 (8798) the waters H4325 in the seas H3220, and let fowl H5775 multiply H7235 (8799) in the earth H0776.
001:023 And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the fifth H2549 day H3117.
001:024 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let the earth H0776 bring forth H3318 (8686) the living H2416 creature H5315 after his kind H4327, cattle H0929, and creeping thing H7431, and beast H2416 of the earth H0776 after his kind H4327: and it was so.
001:025 And God H0430 made H6213 (8799) the beast H2416 of the earth H0776 after his kind H4327, and cattle H0929 after their kind H4327, and every thing that creepeth H7431 upon the earth H0127 after his kind H4327: and God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) that [it was] good H2896.
001:026 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let us make H6213 (8799) man H0120 in our image H6754, after our likeness H1823: and let them have dominion H7287 (8799) over the fish H1710 of the sea H3220, and over the fowl H5775 of the air H8064, and over the cattle H0929, and over all the earth H0776, and over every creeping thing H7431 that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776.
001:027 So God H0430 created H1254 (8799) man H0120 in his [own] image H6754, in the image H6754 of God H0430 created H1254 (8804) he him; male H2145 and female H5347 created H1254 (8804) he them.
001:028 And God H0430 blessed H1288 (8762) them, and God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Be fruitful H6509 (8798), and multiply H7235 (8798), and replenish H4390 (8798) the earth H0776, and subdue it H3533 (8798): and have dominion H7287 (8798) over the fish H1710 of the sea H3220, and over the fowl H5775 of the air H8064, and over every living thing H2416 that moveth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776.
001:029 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Behold H2009, I have given H5414 (8804) you every herb H6212 bearing H2232 (8802) seed H2233, which [is] upon the face H6440 of all the earth H0776, and every tree H6086, in the which [is] the fruit H6529 of a tree H6086 yielding H2232 (8802) seed H2233; to you it shall be H1961 (8799) for meat H0402.
001:030 And to every beast H2416 of the earth H0776, and to every fowl H5775 of the air H8064, and to every thing that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776, wherein [there is] life H2416 H5315, [I have given] every green H3418 herb H6212 for meat H0402: and it was so.
001:031 And God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) every thing that H0834 he had made H6213 (8804), and, behold, [it was] very H3966 good H2896. And the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 were the sixth H8345 day H3117.
002:001 ¶ Thus the heavens H8064 and the earth H0776 were finished H3615 (8792), and all the host of them H6635.
002:002 And on the seventh H7637 day H3117 God H0430 ended H3615 (8762) his work H4399 which he had made H6213 (8804); and he rested H7673 (8799) on the seventh H7637 day H3117 from all his work H4399 which he had made H6213 (8804).
002:003 And God H0430 blessed H1288 (8762) the seventh H7637 day H3117, and sanctified H6942 (8762) it: because H3588 that in it he had rested H7673 (8804) from all his work H4399 which God H0430 created H1254 (8804) and made H6213 (8800).
002:004 These H0428 [are] the generations H8435 of the heavens H8064 and of the earth H0776 when they were created H1254 (8736), in the day H3117 that the LORD H3068 God H0430 made H6213 (8800) the earth H0776 and the heavens H8064,
002:005 And every plant H7880 of the field H7704 before H2962 it was in the earth H0776, and every herb H6212 of the field H7704 before H2962 it grew H6779 (8799): for H3588 the LORD H3068 God H0430 had not H3808 caused it to rain H4305 (8689) upon the earth H0776, and [there was] not H0369 a man H0120 to till H5647 (8800) the ground H0127.
002:006 But there went up H5927 (8799) a mist H0108 from H4480 the earth H0776, and watered H8248 (8689) the whole face H6440 of the ground H0127.
002:007 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 formed H3335 (8799) man H0120 [of] the dust H6083 of H4480 the ground H0127, and breathed H5301 (8799) into his nostrils H0639 the breath H5397 of life H2416; and man H0120 became a living H2416 soul H5315.
002:008 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 planted H5193 (8799) a garden H1588 eastward H6924 in Eden H5731; and there H8033 he put H7760 (8799) the man H0120 whom H0834 he had formed H3335 (8804).
002:009 And out H4480 of the ground H0127 made H6779 the LORD H3068 God H0430 to grow H6779 (8686) every tree H6086 that is pleasant H2530 (8737) to the sight H4758, and good H2896 for food H3978; the tree H6086 of life H2416 also in the midst H8432 of the garden H1588, and the tree H6086 of knowledge H1847 of good H2896 and evil H7451.
002:010 And a river H5104 went out H3318 (8802) of Eden H5731 to water H8248 (8687) the garden H1588; and from thence it was parted H6504 (8735), and became into four H0702 heads H7218.
002:011 The name H8034 of the first H0259 [is] Pison H6376: that H1931 [is] it which compasseth H5437 (8802) the whole land H0776 of Havilah H2341, where H0834 [there is] gold H2091;
002:012 And the gold H2091 of that H1931 land H0776 [is] good H2896: there [is] bdellium H0916 and the onyx H7718 stone H0068.
002:013 And the name H8034 of the second H8145 river H5104 [is] Gihon H1521: the same [is] it that compasseth H5437 (8802) the whole land H0776 of Ethiopia H3568.
002:014 And the name H8034 of the third H7992 river H5104 [is] Hiddekel H2313: that [is] it which goeth toward H1980 (8802) the east H6926 of Assyria H0804. And the fourth H7243 river H5104 [is] Euphrates H6578.
002:015 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 took H3947 (8799) the man H0120, and put him H3240 (8686) into the garden H1588 of Eden H5731 to dress H5647 (8800) it and to keep H8104 (8800) it.
002:016 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 commanded H6680 (8762) the man H0120, saying H0559 (8800), Of every tree H6086 of the garden H1588 thou mayest freely H0398 (8800) eat H0398 (8799):
002:017 But of the tree H6086 of the knowledge H1847 of good H2896 and evil H7451, thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) of it: for in the day H3117 that thou eatest H0398 (8800) thereof thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
002:018 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 said H0559 (8799), [It is] not good H2896 that the man H0120 should be H1961 (8800) alone; I will make H6213 (8799) him an help meet H5828 for him.
002:019 And out of the ground H0127 the LORD H3068 God H0430 formed H3335 (8799) every beast H2416 of the field H7704, and every fowl H5775 of the air H8064; and brought H0935 (8686) [them] unto Adam H0120 to see H7200 (8800) what he would call H7121 (8799) them: and whatsoever Adam H0120 called H7121 (8799) every living H2416 creature H5315, that H1931 [was] the name thereof H8034.
002:020 And Adam H0120 gave H7121 (8799) names H8034 to all cattle H0929, and to the fowl H5775 of the air H8064, and to every beast H2416 of the field H7704; but for Adam H0120 there was not found H4672 (8804) an help meet H5828 for him.
002:021 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 caused H5307 a deep sleep H8639 to fall H5307 (8686) upon Adam H0121, and he slept H3462 (8799): and he took H3947 (8799) one H0259 of his ribs H6763, and closed up H5462 (8799) the flesh H1320 instead thereof;
002:022 And the rib H6763, which the LORD H3068 God H0430 had taken H3947 (8804) from man H0120, made H1129 (8799) he a woman H0802, and brought H0935 (8686) her unto the man H0120.
002:023 And Adam H0120 said H0559 (8799), This H2063 [is] now H6471 bone H6106 of my bones H6106, and flesh H1320 of my flesh H1320: she H2063 shall be called H7121 (8735) Woman H0802, because she H2063 was taken H3947 (8795) out of Man H0376.
002:024 Therefore H3651 shall a man H0376 leave H5800 (8799) his father H0001 and his mother H0517, and shall cleave H1692 (8804) unto his wife H0802: and they shall be one H0259 flesh H1320.
002:025 And they were both H8147 naked H6174, the man H0120 and his wife H0802, and were not ashamed H0954 (8709).
003:001 ¶ Now the serpent H5175 was H1961 (8804) more subtil H6175 than any beast H2416 of the field H7704 which the LORD H3068 God H0430 had made H6213 (8804). And he said H0559 (8799) unto the woman H0802, Yea H0637, hath God H0430 said H0559 (8804), Ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) of every tree H6086 of the garden H1588?
003:002 And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799) unto the serpent H5175, We may eat H0398 (8799) of the fruit H6529 of the trees H6086 of the garden H1588:
003:003 But of the fruit H6529 of the tree H6086 which [is] in the midst H8432 of the garden H1588, God H0430 hath said H0559 (8804), Ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) of it, neither shall ye touch H5060 (8799) it, lest H6435 ye die H4191 (8799).
003:004 And the serpent H5175 said H0559 (8799) unto the woman H0802, Ye shall not surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799):
003:005 For God H0430 doth know H3045 (8802) that in the day H3117 ye eat H0398 (8800) thereof, then your eyes H5869 shall be opened H6491 (8738), and ye shall be as gods H0430, knowing H3045 (8802) good H2896 and evil H7451.
003:006 And when the woman H0802 saw H7200 (8799) that the tree H6086 [was] good H2896 for food H3978, and that it H1931 [was] pleasant H8378 to the eyes H5869, and a tree H6086 to be desired H2530 (8737) to make [one] wise H7919 (8687), she took H3947 (8799) of the fruit thereof H6529, and did eat H0398 (8799), and gave H5414 (8799) also H1571 unto her husband H0376 with her; and he did eat H0398 (8799).
003:007 And the eyes H5869 of them both H8147 were opened H6491 (8735), and they H1992 knew H3045 (8799) that they [were] naked H5903; and they sewed H8609 fig H8384 leaves H5929 together H8609 (8799), and made themselves H6213 (8799) aprons H2290.
003:008 And they heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 walking H1980 (8693) in the garden H1588 in the cool H7307 of the day H3117: and Adam H0120 and his wife H0802 hid themselves H2244 (8691) from the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 amongst H8432 the trees H6086 of the garden H1588.
003:009 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 called H7121 (8799) unto Adam H0120, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Where [art] thou H0335?
003:010 And he said H0559 (8799), I heard H8085 (8804) thy voice H6963 in the garden H1588, and I was afraid H3372 (8799), because I H0595 [was] naked H5903; and I hid myself H2244 (8735).
003:011 And he said H0559 (8799), Who H4310 told H5046 (8689) thee that thou [wast] naked H5903? Hast thou eaten H0398 (8804) of the tree H6086, whereof I commanded thee H6680 (8765) that thou shouldest not H1115 eat H0398 (8800)?
003:012 And the man H0120 said H0559 (8799), The woman H0802 whom thou gavest H5414 (8804) [to be] with me H5978, she H1931 gave H5414 (8804) me of the tree H6086, and I did eat H0398 (8799).
003:013 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto the woman H0802, What [is] this [that] thou hast done H6213 (8804)? And the woman H0802 said H0559 (8799), The serpent H5175 beguiled me H5377 (8689), and I did eat H0398 (8799).
003:014 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto the serpent H5175, Because thou H0859 hast done H6213 (8804) this, thou [art] cursed H0779 (8803) above all cattle H0929, and above every beast H2416 of the field H7704; upon thy belly H1512 shalt thou go H3212 (8799), and dust H6083 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) all the days H3117 of thy life H2416:
003:015 And I will put H7896 (8799) enmity H0342 between thee and the woman H0802, and between thy seed H2233 and her seed H2233; it shall bruise H7779 (8799) thy head H7218, and thou shalt bruise H7779 (8799) his heel H6119.
003:016 Unto the woman H0802 he said H0559 (8804), I will greatly H7235 (8687) multiply H7235 (8686) thy sorrow H6093 and thy conception H2032; in sorrow H6089 thou shalt bring forth H3205 (8799) children H1121; and thy desire H8669 [shall be] to thy husband H0376, and he shall rule H4910 (8799) over thee.
003:017 And unto Adam H0121 he said H0559 (8804), Because thou hast hearkened H8085 (8804) unto the voice H6963 of thy wife H0802, and hast eaten H0398 (8799) of the tree H6086, of which H0834 I commanded thee H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt not eat H0398 (8799) of it: cursed H0779 (8803) [is] the ground H0127 for thy sake; in sorrow H6093 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) [of] it all H3605 the days H3117 of thy life H2416;
003:018 Thorns also H6975 and thistles H1863 shall it bring forth H6779 (8686) to thee; and thou shalt eat H0398 (8804) the herb H6212 of the field H7704;
003:019 In the sweat H2188 of thy face H0639 shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899, till H5704 thou return H7725 (8800) unto the ground H0127; for out of it wast thou taken H3947 (8795): for dust H6083 thou H0859 [art], and unto dust H6083 shalt thou return H7725 (8799).
003:020 And Adam H0120 called H7121 (8799) his wife’s H0802 name H8034 Eve H2332; because she was the mother H0517 of all living H2416.
003:021 Unto Adam H0120 also and to his wife H0802 did the LORD H3068 God H0430 make H6213 (8799) coats H3801 of skins H5785, and clothed them H3847 (8686).
003:022 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Behold H2005, the man H0120 is become as one H0259 of us, to know H3045 (8800) good H2896 and evil H7451: and now, lest he put forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and take H3947 (8804) also of the tree H6086 of life H2416, and eat H0398 (8804), and live H2425 (8804) for ever H5769:
003:023 Therefore the LORD H3068 God H0430 sent him forth H7971 (8762) from the garden H1588 of Eden H5731, to till H5647 (8800) the ground H0127 from whence he was taken H3947 (8795).
003:024 So he drove out H1644 (8762) the man H0120; and he placed H7931 (8686) at the east H6924 of the garden H1588 of Eden H5731 Cherubims H3742, and a flaming H3858 sword H2719 which turned every way H2015 (8693), to keep H8104 (8800) the way H1870 of the tree H6086 of life H2416.
004:001 ¶ And Adam H0120 knew H3045 (8804) H0853 Eve H2332 his wife H0802; and she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) H0853 Cain H7014, and said H0559 (8799), I have gotten H7069 (8804) a man H0376 from H0854 the LORD H3068.
004:002 And she again H3254 (8686) bare H3205 (8800) his brother H0251 Abel H1893. And Abel H1893 was a keeper H7462 (8802) of sheep H6629, but Cain H7014 was a tiller H5647 (8802) of the ground H0127.
004:003 And in process H7093 of time H3117 it came to pass, that Cain H7014 brought H0935 (8686) of the fruit H6529 of the ground H0127 an offering H4503 unto the LORD H3068.
004:004 And Abel H1893, he H1931 also brought H0935 (8689) of the firstlings H1062 of his flock H6629 and of the fat H2459 thereof. And the LORD H3068 had respect H8159 (8799) unto Abel H1893 and to his offering H4503:
004:005 But unto Cain H7014 and to his offering H4503 he had not respect H8159 (8804). And Cain H7014 was very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799), and his countenance H6440 fell H5307 (8799).
004:006 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Cain H7014, Why art thou wroth H2734 (8804)? and why is thy countenance H6440 fallen H5307 (8804)?
004:007 If H0518 thou doest well H3190 (8686), shalt thou not be accepted H7613? and if thou doest not well H3190 (8686), sin H2403 lieth H7257 (8802) at the door H6607. And unto thee [shall be] his desire H8669, and thou shalt rule H4910 (8799) over him.
004:008 And Cain H7014 talked H0559 (8799) with H0413 Abel H1893 his brother H0251: and it came to pass, when they were in the field H7704, that Cain H7014 rose up H6965 (8799) against H0413 Abel H1893 his brother H0251, and slew him H2026 (8799).
004:009 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Cain H7014, Where H0335 [is] Abel H1893 thy brother H0251? And he said H0559 (8799), I know H3045 (8804) not: [Am] I my brother’s H0251 keeper H8104 (8802)?
004:010 And he said H0559 (8799), What H4100 hast thou done H6213 (8804)? the voice H6963 of thy brother’s H0251 blood H1818 crieth H6817 (8802) unto me from the ground H0127.
004:011 And now [art] thou cursed H0779 (8803) from the earth H0127, which hath opened H6475 (8804) her mouth H6310 to receive H3947 (8800) thy brother’s H0251 blood H1818 from thy hand H3027;
004:012 When H3588 thou tillest H5647 (8799) the ground H0127, it shall not henceforth H3254 (8686) yield H5414 (8800) unto thee her strength H3581; a fugitive H5128 (8801) and a vagabond H5110 (8802) shalt thou be in the earth H0776.
004:013 And Cain H7014 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, My punishment H5771 [is] greater H1419 than I can bear H5375 (8800).
004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out H1644 (8765) this day H3117 from the face H6440 of the earth H0127; and from H5921 thy face H6440 shall I be hid H5641 (8735); and I shall be a fugitive H5128 (8801) and a vagabond H5110 (8802) in the earth H0776; and it shall come to pass H1961 (8804), [that] every one that findeth me H4672 (8802) shall slay me H2026 (8799).
004:015 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Therefore H3651 whosoever slayeth H2026 (8802) Cain H7014, vengeance shall be taken H5358 (8714) on him sevenfold H7659. And the LORD H3068 set H7760 (8799) a mark H0226 upon Cain H7014, lest H1115 any finding H4672 (8802) him should kill H5221 (8687) him.
004:016 And Cain H7014 went out H3318 (8799) from the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of Nod H5113, on the east H6926 of Eden H5731.
004:017 And Cain H7014 knew H3045 (8799) his wife H0802; and she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) Enoch H2585: and he builded H1129 (8802) a city H5892, and called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the city H5892, after the name H8034 of his son H1121, Enoch H2585.
004:018 And unto Enoch H2585 was born H3205 (8735) Irad H5897: and Irad H5897 begat H3205 (8804) Mehujael H4232: and Mehujael H4232 begat H3205 (8804) Methusael H4967: and Methusael H4967 begat H3205 (8804) Lamech H3929.
004:019 And Lamech H3929 took H3947 (8799) unto him two H8147 wives H0802: the name H8034 of the one H0259 [was] Adah H5711, and the name H8034 of the other H8145 Zillah H6741.
004:020 And Adah H5711 bare H3205 (8799) Jabal H2989: he was the father H0001 of such as dwell H3427 (8802) in tents H0168, and [of such as have] cattle H4735.
004:021 And his brother’s H0251 name H8034 [was] Jubal H3106: he was the father H0001 of all such as handle H8610 (8802) the harp H3658 and organ H5748.
004:022 And Zillah H6741, she also bare H3205 (8804) Tubalcain H8423, an instructer H3913 (8803) of every artificer H2794 in brass H5178 and iron H1270: and the sister H0269 of Tubalcain H8423 [was] Naamah H5279.
004:023 And Lamech H3929 said H0559 (8799) unto his wives H0802, Adah H5711 and Zillah H6741, Hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963; ye wives H0802 of Lamech H3929, hearken H0238 (8685) unto my speech H0565: for I have slain H2026 (8804) a man H0376 to my wounding H6482, and a young man H3206 to my hurt H2250.
004:024 If H3588 Cain H7014 shall be avenged H5358 (8714) sevenfold H7659, truly Lamech H3929 seventy H7657 and sevenfold H7651.
004:025 And Adam H0120 knew H3045 (8799) his wife H0802 again H5750; and she bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Seth H8352: For God H0430, [said she], hath appointed H7896 (8804) me another H0312 seed H2233 instead H8478 of Abel H1893, whom H3588 Cain H7014 slew H2026 (8804).
004:026 And to Seth H8352, to him H1931 also there was born H3205 (8795) a son H1121; and he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Enos H0583: then began men H2490 (8717) to call H7121 (8800) upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
005:001 ¶ This H2088 [is] the book H5612 of the generations H8435 of Adam H0121. In the day H3117 that God H0430 created H1254 (8800) man H0120, in the likeness H1823 of God H0430 made H6213 (8804) he him;
005:002 Male H2145 and female H5347 created H1254 (8804) he them; and blessed H1288 (8762) them, and called H7121 (8799) their name H8034 Adam H0120, in the day H3117 when they were created H1254 (8736).
005:003 And Adam H0121 lived H2421 (8799) an hundred H3967 and thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) [a son] in his own likeness H1823, after his image H6754; and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Seth H8352:
005:004 And the days H3117 of Adam H0121 after H0310 he had begotten H3205 (8687) Seth H8352 were eight H8083 hundred H3967 years H8141: and he begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323:

005:006 And Seth H8352 lived H2421 (8799) an hundred H3967 H8141 and five H2568 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Enos H0583:

005:011 And all the days H3117 of Enos H0583 were nine H8672 hundred H3967 H8141 and five H2568 years H8141: and he died H4191 (8799).
005:012 And Cainan H7018 lived H2421 (8799) seventy H7657 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Mahalaleel H4111:

005:014 And all the days H3117 of Cainan H7018 were nine H8672 hundred H3967 H8141 and ten H6235 years H8141: and he died H4191 (8799).

005:019 And Jared H3382 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Enoch H2585 eight H8083 hundred H3967 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323:

005:023 And all the days H3117 of Enoch H2585 were three H7969 hundred H3967 H8141 sixty H8346 and five H2568 years H8141:
005:024 And Enoch H2585 walked H1980 (8691) with God H0430: and he [was] not; for God H0430 took H3947 (8804) him.
005:025 And Methuselah H4968 lived H2421 (8799) an hundred H3967 H8141 eighty H8084 and seven H7651 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Lamech H3929:

005:027 And all the days H3117 of Methuselah H4968 were nine H8672 hundred H3967 H8141 sixty H8346 and nine H8672 years H8141: and he died H4191 (8799).
005:028 And Lamech H3929 lived H2421 (8799) an hundred H3967 H8141 eighty H8084 and two H8147 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) a son H1121:
005:029 And he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Noah H5146, saying H0559 (8800), This [same] shall comfort H5162 (8762) us concerning our work H4639 and toil H6093 of our hands H3027, because H4480 of the ground H0127 which the LORD H3068 hath cursed H0779 (8765).
005:030 And Lamech H3929 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Noah H5146 five H2568 hundred H3967 H8141 ninety H8673 and five H2568 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323:

005:032 And Noah H5146 was five H2568 hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121: and Noah H5146 begat H3205 (8686) Shem H8035, Ham H2526, and Japheth H3315.
006:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when men H0120 began H2490 (8689) to multiply H7231 (8800) on H5921 the face H6440 of the earth H0127, and daughters H1323 were born H3205 (8795) unto them,
006:002 That the sons H1121 of God H0430 saw H7200 (8799) the daughters H1323 of men H0120 that they H2007 [were] fair H2896; and they took H3947 (8799) them wives H0802 of all which they chose H0977 (8804).
006:003 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), My spirit H7307 shall not always H5769 strive H1777 (8799) with man H0120, for that he also H1571 (8677) H7683 (8800) [is] flesh H1320: yet his days H3117 shall be an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 years H8141.
006:004 There were giants H5303 in the earth H0776 in those days H3117; and also after H0310 that H3651, when H0834 the sons H1121 of God H0430 came in H0935 (8799) unto the daughters H1323 of men H0120, and they bare H3205 (8804) [children] to them, the same H1992 [became] mighty men H1368 which [were] of old H5769, men H0582 of renown H8034.
006:005 And GOD H3068 saw H7200 (8799) that the wickedness H7451 of man H0120 [was] great H7227 in the earth H0776, and [that] every imagination H3336 of the thoughts H4284 of his heart H3820 [was] only H7535 evil H7451 continually H3117.
006:006 And it repented H5162 (8735) the LORD H3068 that he had made H6213 (8804) man H0120 on the earth H0776, and it grieved H6087 (8691) him at H0413 his heart H3820.
006:007 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), I will destroy H4229 (8799) man H0120 whom I have created H1254 (8804) from the face H6440 of the earth H0127; both man H0120, and H5704 beast H0929, and the creeping thing H7431, and the fowls H5775 of the air H8064; for it repenteth H5162 (8738) me that I have made H6213 (8804) them.
006:008 But Noah H5146 found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068.
006:009 These [are] the generations H8435 of Noah H5146: Noah H5146 was a just H6662 man H0376 [and] perfect H8549 in his generations H1755, [and] Noah H5146 walked H1980 (8694) with God H0430.
006:010 And Noah H5146 begat H3205 (8686) three H7969 sons H1121, Shem H8035, Ham H2526, and Japheth H3315.
006:011 The earth H0776 also was corrupt H7843 (8735) before H6440 God H0430, and the earth H0776 was filled H4390 (8735) with violence H2555.
006:012 And God H0430 looked H7200 (8799) upon the earth H0776, and, behold, it was corrupt H7843 (8738); for all flesh H1320 had corrupted H7843 (8689) his way H1870 upon the earth H0776.
006:013 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Noah H5146, The end H7093 of all flesh H1320 is come H0935 (8804) before me H6440; for the earth H0776 is filled with H4390 (8804) violence H2555 through them H6440; and, behold, I will destroy H7843 (8688) them with H0854 the earth H0776.
006:014 Make H6213 (8798) thee an ark H8392 of gopher H1613 wood H6086; rooms H7064 shalt thou make H6213 (8799) in H0854 the ark H8392, and shalt pitch H3722 (8804) it within H1004 and without H2351 with pitch H3724.
006:015 And this [is the fashion] which thou shalt make H6213 (8799) it [of]: The length H0753 of the ark H8392 [shall be] three H7969 hundred H3967 cubits H0520, the breadth H7341 of it fifty H2572 cubits H0520, and the height H6967 of it thirty H7970 cubits H0520.
006:016 A window H6672 shalt thou make H6213 (8799) to the ark H8392, and in a cubit H0520 shalt thou finish H3615 (8762) it above H4605; and the door H6607 of the ark H8392 shalt thou set H7760 (8799) in the side thereof H6654; [with] lower H8482, second H8145, and third H7992 [stories] shalt thou make H6213 (8799) it.
006:017 And, behold H2009, I H0589, even I, do bring H0935 (8688) a flood H3999 of waters H4325 upon the earth H0776, to destroy H7843 (8763) all flesh H1320, wherein [is] the breath H7307 of life H2416, from under H8478 heaven H8064; [and] every thing H3605 that [is] in the earth H0776 shall die H1478 (8799).
006:018 But with thee will I establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285; and thou shalt come H0935 (8804) into H0413 the ark H8392, thou H0859, and thy sons H1121, and thy wife H0802, and thy sons H1121 ’ wives H0802 with thee.
006:019 And of every living thing H2416 of all flesh H1320, two H8147 of every [sort] shalt thou bring H0935 (8686) into the ark H8392, to keep [them] alive H2421 (8687) with thee; they shall be male H2145 and female H5347.
006:020 Of fowls H5775 after their kind H4327, and of cattle H0929 after their kind H4327, of every creeping thing H7431 of the earth H0127 after his kind H4327, two H8147 of every [sort] shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee, to keep [them] alive H2421 (8687).
006:021 And take H3947 (8798) thou unto thee of all food H3978 that is eaten H0398 (8735), and thou shalt gather H0622 (8804) [it] to thee; and it shall be for food H0402 for thee, and for them.
006:022 Thus did H6213 (8799) Noah H5146; according to all that God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) him, so did H6213 (8804) he.
007:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Noah H5146, Come H0935 (8798) thou and all thy house H1004 into the ark H8392; for thee have I seen H7200 (8804) righteous H6662 before me H6440 in this H2088 generation H1755.
007:002 Of every clean H2889 beast H0929 thou shalt take H3947 (8799) to thee by sevens H7651 H7651, the male H0376 and his female H0802: and of beasts H0929 that [are] not clean H2889 H1931 by two H8147, the male H0376 and his female H0802.
007:003 Of fowls H5775 also of the air H8064 by sevens H7651 H7651, the male H2145 and the female H5347; to keep H2421 seed H2233 alive H2421 (8763) upon the face H6440 of all the earth H0776.
007:004 For yet H5750 seven H7651 days H3117, and I will cause it to rain H4305 (8688) upon the earth H0776 forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915; and every H3605 living substance H3351 that I have made H6213 (8804) will I destroy H4229 (8804) from off H5921 the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
007:005 And Noah H5146 did H6213 (8799) according unto all that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) him.
007:006 And Noah H5146 [was] six H8337 hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121 when the flood H3999 of waters H4325 was upon the earth H0776.
007:007 And Noah H5146 went in H0935 (8799), and his sons H1121, and his wife H0802, and his sons H1121 ’ wives H0802 with him, into the ark H8392, because of H6440 the waters H4325 of the flood H3999.
007:008 Of clean H2889 beasts H0929, and of beasts H0929 that [are] not clean H2889, and of fowls H5775, and of every thing that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0127,
007:009 There went in H0935 (8804) two H8147 and two H8147 unto Noah H5146 into the ark H8392, the male H2145 and the female H5347, as H0834 God H0430 had commanded H6680 (8765) Noah H5146.
007:010 And it came to pass after seven H7651 days H3117, that the waters H4325 of the flood H3999 were upon the earth H0776.
007:011 In H8141 the six H8337 hundredth H3967 year H8141 of Noah’s H5146 life H2416, in the second H8145 month H2320, the seventeenth H7651 H6240 day H3117 of the month H2320, the same H2088 day H3117 were all the fountains H4599 of the great H7227 deep H8415 broken up H1234 (8738), and the windows H0699 of heaven H8064 were opened H6605 (8738).
007:012 And the rain H1653 was upon the earth H0776 forty H0705 days H3117 and forty H0705 nights H3915.
007:013 In the selfsame H6106 day H3117 entered H0935 (8804) Noah H5146, and Shem H8035, and Ham H2526, and Japheth H3315, the sons H1121 of Noah H5146, and Noah’s H5146 wife H0802, and the three H7969 wives H0802 of his sons H1121 with them, into the ark H8392;
007:014 They H1992, and every beast H2416 after his kind H4327, and all the cattle H0929 after their kind H4327, and every creeping thing H7431 that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776 after his kind H4327, and every fowl H5775 after his kind H4327, every bird H6833 of every sort H3671.
007:015 And they went in H0935 (8799) unto Noah H5146 into the ark H8392, two H8147 and two H8147 of all flesh H1320, wherein H0834 [is] the breath H7307 of life H2416.
007:016 And they that went in H0935 (8802), went in H0935 (8804) male H2145 and female H5347 of all flesh H1320, as God H0430 had commanded H6680 (8765) him: and the LORD H3068 shut him in H5462 (8799).
007:017 And the flood H3999 was forty H0705 days H3117 upon the earth H0776; and the waters H4325 increased H7235 (8799), and bare up H5375 (8799) the ark H8392, and it was lift up H7311 (8799) above the earth H0776.
007:018 And the waters H4325 prevailed H1396 (8799), and were increased H7235 (8799) greatly H3966 upon the earth H0776; and the ark H8392 went H3212 (8799) upon the face H6440 of the waters H4325.
007:019 And the waters H4325 prevailed H1396 (8804) exceedingly H3966 H3966 upon the earth H0776; and all the high H1364 hills H2022, that [were] under H8478 the whole heaven H8064, were covered H3680 (8792).
007:020 Fifteen H6240 H2568 cubits H0520 upward H4605 did the waters H4325 prevail H1396 (8804); and the mountains H2022 were covered H3680 (8792).
007:021 And all flesh H1320 died H1478 (8799) that moved H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776, both of fowl H5775, and of cattle H0929, and of beast H2416, and of every creeping thing H8318 that creepeth H8317 (8802) upon the earth H0776, and every man H0120:
007:022 All in whose nostrils H0639 [was] the breath H5397 H7307 of life H2416, of all that [was] in the dry H2724 [land], died H4191 (8804).
007:023 And every living substance H3351 was destroyed H4229 (8735) which was upon the face H6440 of the ground H0127, both man H0120, and cattle H0929, and the creeping things H7431, and the fowl H5775 of the heaven H8064; and they were destroyed H4229 (8735) from the earth H0776: and Noah H5146 only H0389 remained H7604 (8735) [alive], and they that H0834 [were] with him in the ark H8392.
007:024 And the waters H4325 prevailed H1396 (8799) upon the earth H0776 an hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 days H3117.
008:001 ¶ And God H0430 remembered H2142 (8799) Noah H5146, and every living thing H2416, and all the cattle H0929 that [was] with him in the ark H8392: and God H0430 made H5674 a wind H7307 to pass H5674 (8686) over H5921 the earth H0776, and the waters H4325 asswaged H7918 (8799);
008:002 The fountains H4599 also of the deep H8415 and the windows H0699 of heaven H8064 were stopped H5534 (8735), and the rain H1653 from heaven H8064 was restrained H3607 (8735);
008:003 And the waters H4325 returned H7725 (8799) from off the earth H0776 continually H1980 (8800) H7725 (8800): and after the end H7097 of the hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 days H3117 the waters H4325 were abated H2637 (8799).
008:004 And the ark H8392 rested H5117 (8799) in the seventh H7637 month H2320, on the seventeenth H6240 H7651 day H3117 of the month H2320, upon the mountains H2022 of Ararat H0780.
008:005 And the waters H4325 decreased H2637 (8800) continually H1980 (8800) until H5704 the tenth H6224 month H2320: in the tenth H6224 [month], on the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, were the tops H7218 of the mountains H2022 seen H7200 (8738).
008:006 And it came to pass at the end H7093 of forty H0705 days H3117, that Noah H5146 opened H6605 (8799) the window H2474 of the ark H8392 which he had made H6213 (8804):
008:007 And he sent forth H7971 (8762) a raven H6158, which went forth H3318 (8799) to H3318 (8800) and fro H7725 (8800), until the waters H4325 were dried up H3001 (8800) from off the earth H0776.
008:008 Also he sent forth H7971 (8762) a dove H3123 from him, to see H7200 (8800) if the waters H4325 were abated H7043 (8804) from off the face H6440 of the ground H0127;
008:009 But the dove H3123 found H4672 (8804) no rest H4494 for the sole H3709 of her foot H7272, and she returned H7725 (8799) unto him into the ark H8392, for the waters H4325 [were] on the face H6440 of the whole earth H0776: then he put forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and took her H3947 (8799), and pulled her in H0935 (8686) unto him into the ark H8392.
008:010 And he stayed H2342 (8799) yet other H0312 seven H7651 days H3117; and again H3254 (8686) he sent forth H7971 (8763) the dove H3123 out of the ark H8392;
008:011 And the dove H3123 came in H0935 (8799) to him in the evening H6256 H6153; and, lo, in her mouth H6310 [was] an olive H2132 leaf H5929 pluckt off H2965: so Noah H5146 knew H3045 (8799) that the waters H4325 were abated H7043 (8804) from off the earth H0776.
008:012 And he stayed H3176 (8735) yet other H0312 seven H7651 days H3117; and sent forth H7971 (8762) the dove H3123; which returned H7725 (8800) not again H3254 (8804) unto him any more H5750.
008:013 And it came to pass in the six H8337 hundredth H3967 and first year H8141, in the first H7223 [month], the first H0259 [day] of the month H2320, the waters H4325 were dried up H2717 (8804) from off the earth H0776: and Noah H5146 removed H5493 (8686) the covering H4372 of the ark H8392, and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, the face H6440 of the ground H0127 was dry H2717 (8804).
008:014 And in the second H8145 month H2320, on the seven H7651 and twentieth H6242 day H3117 of the month H2320, was the earth H0776 dried H3001 (8804).
008:015 And God H0430 spake H1696 (8762) unto Noah H5146, saying H0559 (8800),
008:016 Go forth H3318 (8798) of the ark H8392, thou, and thy wife H0802, and thy sons H1121, and thy sons H1121 ’ wives H0802 with thee.
008:017 Bring forth H3318 (8685) with thee every living thing H2416 that [is] with thee, of all flesh H1320, [both] of fowl H5775, and of cattle H0929, and of every creeping thing H7431 that creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776; that they may breed abundantly H8317 (8804) in the earth H0776, and be fruitful H6509 (8804), and multiply H7235 (8804) upon the earth H0776.
008:018 And Noah H5146 went forth H3318 (8799), and his sons H1121, and his wife H0802, and his sons H1121 ’ wives H0802 with him:
008:019 Every beast H2416, every creeping thing H7431, and every fowl H5775, [and] whatsoever H3605 creepeth H7430 (8802) upon the earth H0776, after their kinds H4940, went forth H3318 (8804) out of the ark H8392.
008:020 And Noah H5146 builded H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068; and took H3947 (8799) of every clean H2889 beast H0929, and of every clean H2889 fowl H5775, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 on the altar H4196.
008:021 And the LORD H3068 smelled H7306 (8686) a sweet H5207 savour H7381; and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) in H0413 his heart H3820, I will not again H3254 (8686) curse H7043 (8763) the ground H0127 any more for man’s H0120 sake H5668; for the imagination H3336 of man’s H0120 heart H3820 [is] evil H7451 from his youth H5271; neither will I again H3254 (8686) smite H5221 (8687) any more every thing living H2416, as I have done H6213 (8804).
008:022 While the earth H0776 remaineth H3117, seedtime H2233 and harvest H7105, and cold H7120 and heat H2527, and summer H7019 and winter H2779, and day H3117 and night H3915 shall not cease H7673 (8799).
009:001 ¶ And God H0430 blessed H1288 (8762) Noah H5146 and his sons H1121, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Be fruitful H6509 (8798), and multiply H7235 (8798), and replenish H4390 (8798) the earth H0776.
009:002 And the fear of you H4172 and the dread of you H2844 shall be upon every beast H2416 of the earth H0776, and upon every fowl H5775 of the air H8064, upon all that moveth H7430 (8799) [upon] the earth H0127, and upon all the fishes H1709 of the sea H3220; into your hand H3027 are they delivered H5414 (8738).
009:003 Every moving thing H7431 that liveth H2416 shall be meat H0402 for you; even as the green H3418 herb H6212 have I given H5414 (8804) you all things.
009:004 But H0389 flesh H1320 with the life H5315 thereof, [which is] the blood H1818 thereof, shall ye not eat H0398 (8799).
009:005 And surely H0389 your blood H1818 of your lives H5315 will I require H1875 (8799); at the hand H3027 of every beast H2416 will I require it H1875 (8799), and at the hand H3027 of man H0120; at the hand H3027 of every man’s H0376 brother H0251 will I require H1875 (8799) the life H5315 of man H0120.
009:006 Whoso sheddeth H8210 (8802) man’s H0120 blood H1818, by man H0120 shall his blood H1818 be shed H8210 (8735): for in the image H6754 of God H0430 made H6213 (8804) he man H0120.
009:007 And you, be ye fruitful H6509 (8798), and multiply H7235 (8798); bring forth abundantly H8317 (8798) in the earth H0776, and multiply H7235 (8798) therein.
009:008 And God H0430 spake H0559 (8799) unto Noah H5146, and to his sons H1121 with him, saying H0559 (8800),
009:009 And I, behold, I establish H6965 (8688) my covenant H1285 with you, and with your seed H2233 after you H0310;
009:010 And with every living H2416 creature H5315 that [is] with you, of the fowl H5775, of the cattle H0929, and of every beast H2416 of the earth H0776 with you; from all that go out H3318 (8802) of the ark H8392, to every beast H2416 of the earth H0776.
009:011 And I will establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285 with you; neither shall all flesh H1320 be cut off H3772 (8735) any more by the waters H4325 of a flood H3999; neither shall there any more be a flood H3999 to destroy H7843 (8763) the earth H0776.
009:012 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), This [is] the token H0226 of the covenant H1285 which I H0589 make H5414 (8802) between me and you and every living H2416 creature H5315 that [is] with you, for perpetual H5769 generations H1755:
009:013 I do set H5414 (8804) my bow H7198 in the cloud H6051, and it shall be for a token H0226 of a covenant H1285 between me and the earth H0776.
009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring H6049 (8763) a cloud H6051 over the earth H0776, that the bow H7198 shall be seen H7200 (8738) in the cloud H6051:
009:015 And I will remember H2142 (8804) my covenant H1285, which [is] between me and you and every living H2416 creature H5315 of all flesh H1320; and the waters H4325 shall no more H5750 become a flood H3999 to destroy H7843 (8763) all flesh H1320.
009:016 And the bow H7198 shall be in the cloud H6051; and I will look upon it H7200 (8804), that I may remember H2142 (8800) the everlasting H5769 covenant H1285 between H0996 God H0430 and H0996 every living H2416 creature H5315 of all flesh H1320 that [is] upon the earth H0776.
009:017 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Noah H5146, This [is] the token H0226 of the covenant H1285, which I have established H6965 (8689) between me and all flesh H1320 that [is] upon the earth H0776.
009:018 And the sons H1121 of Noah H5146, that went forth H3318 (8802) of the ark H8392, were Shem H8035, and Ham H2526, and Japheth H3315: and Ham H2526 H1931 [is] the father H0001 of Canaan H3667.
009:019 These [are] the three H7969 sons H1121 of Noah H5146: and of them was the whole earth H0776 overspread H5310 (8804).
009:020 And Noah H5146 began H2490 (8686) [to be] an husbandman H0376 H0127, and he planted H5193 (8799) a vineyard H3754:
009:021 And he drank H8354 (8799) of the wine H3196, and was drunken H7937 (8799); and he was uncovered H1540 (8691) within H8432 his tent H0168.
009:022 And Ham H2526, the father H0001 of Canaan H3667, saw H7200 (8799) the nakedness H6172 of his father H0001, and told H5046 (8686) his two H8147 brethren H0251 without H2351.
009:023 And Shem H8035 and Japheth H3315 took H3947 (8799) a garment H8071, and laid H7760 (8799) [it] upon both H8147 their shoulders H7926, and went H3212 (8799) backward H0322, and covered H3680 (8762) the nakedness H6172 of their father H0001; and their faces H6440 [were] backward H0322, and they saw H7200 (8804) not their father’s H0001 nakedness H6172.
009:024 And Noah H5146 awoke H3364 (8799) from his wine H3196, and knew H3045 (8799) what his younger H6996 son H1121 had done H6213 (8804) unto him.
009:025 And he said H0559 (8799), Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] Canaan H3667; a servant H5650 of servants H5650 shall he be unto his brethren H0251.
009:026 And he said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Shem H8035; and Canaan H3667 shall be H1961 (8799) his servant H5650.
009:027 God H0430 shall enlarge H6601 (8686) Japheth H3315, and he shall dwell H7931 (8799) in the tents H0168 of Shem H8035; and Canaan H3667 shall be his servant H5650.
009:028 And Noah H5146 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 the flood H3999 three H7969 hundred H3967 H8141 and fifty H2572 years H8141.
009:029 And all the days H3117 of Noah H5146 were nine H8672 hundred H3967 H8141 and fifty H2572 years H8141: and he died H4191 (8799).
010:001 ¶ Now these [are] the generations H8435 of the sons H1121 of Noah H5146, Shem H8035, Ham H2526, and Japheth H3315: and unto them were sons H1121 born H3205 (8735) after H0310 the flood H3999.
010:002 The sons H1121 of Japheth H3315; Gomer H1586, and Magog H4031, and Madai H4074, and Javan H3120, and Tubal H8422, and Meshech H4902, and Tiras H8494.
010:003 And the sons H1121 of Gomer H1586; Ashkenaz H0813, and Riphath H7384, and Togarmah H8425.
010:004 And the sons H1121 of Javan H3120; Elishah H0473, and Tarshish H8659, Kittim H3794, and Dodanim H1721.
010:005 By these were the isles H0339 of the Gentiles H1471 divided in H6504 (8738) their lands H0776; every one H0376 after his tongue H3956, after their families H4940, in their nations H1471.
010:006 And the sons H1121 of Ham H2526; Cush H3568, and Mizraim H4714, and Phut H6316, and Canaan H3667.
010:007 And the sons H1121 of Cush H3568; Seba H5434, and Havilah H2341, and Sabtah H5454, and Raamah H7484, and Sabtecha H5455: and the sons H1121 of Raamah H7484; Sheba H7614, and Dedan H1719.
010:008 And Cush H3568 begat H3205 (8804) Nimrod H5248: he began H2490 (8689) to be H1961 (8800) a mighty one H1368 in the earth H0776.
010:009 He was a mighty H1368 hunter H6718 before H6440 the LORD H3068: wherefore H3651 it is said H0559 (8735), Even as Nimrod H5248 the mighty H1368 hunter H6718 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
010:010 And the beginning H7225 of his kingdom H4467 was Babel H0894, and Erech H0751, and Accad H0390, and Calneh H3641, in the land H0776 of Shinar H8152.
010:011 Out of that land H0776 went forth H3318 (8804) Asshur H0804, and builded H1129 (8799) Nineveh H5210, and the city H5892 Rehoboth H7344, and Calah H3625,
010:012 And Resen H7449 between Nineveh H5210 and Calah H3625: the same [is] a great H1419 city H5892.
010:013 And Mizraim H4714 begat H3205 (8804) Ludim H3866, and Anamim H6047, and Lehabim H3853, and Naphtuhim H5320,
010:014 And Pathrusim H6625, and Casluhim H3695, (out of whom came H3318 (8804) Philistim H6430,) and Caphtorim H3732.
010:015 And Canaan H3667 begat H3205 (8804) Sidon H6721 his firstborn H1060, and Heth H2845,
010:016 And the Jebusite H2983, and the Amorite H0567, and the Girgasite H1622,
010:017 And the Hivite H2340, and the Arkite H6208, and the Sinite H5513,
010:018 And the Arvadite H0721, and the Zemarite H6786, and the Hamathite H2577: and afterward H0310 were the families H4940 of the Canaanites H3669 spread abroad H6327 (8738).
010:019 And the border H1366 of the Canaanites H3669 was from Sidon H6721, as thou comest H0935 (8800) to Gerar H1642, unto Gaza H5804; as thou goest H0935 (8800), unto Sodom H5467, and Gomorrah H6017, and Admah H0126, and Zeboim H6636, even unto Lasha H3962.
010:020 These [are] the sons H1121 of Ham H2526, after their families H4940, after their tongues H3956, in their countries H0776, [and] in their nations H1471.
010:021 Unto Shem H8035 also, the father H0001 of all the children H1121 of Eber H5677, the brother H0251 of Japheth H3315 the elder H1419, even to him were [children] born H3205 (8795).
010:022 The children H1121 of Shem H8035; Elam H5867, and Asshur H0804, and Arphaxad H0775, and Lud H3865, and Aram H0758.
010:023 And the children H1121 of Aram H0758; Uz H5780, and Hul H2343, and Gether H1666, and Mash H4851.
010:024 And Arphaxad H0775 begat H3205 (8804) Salah H7974; and Salah H7974 begat H3205 (8804) Eber H5677.
010:025 And unto Eber H5677 were born H3205 (8795) two H8147 sons H1121: the name H8034 of one H0259 [was] Peleg H6389; for in his days H3117 was the earth H0776 divided H6385 (8738); and his brother’s H0251 name H8034 [was] Joktan H3355.
010:026 And Joktan H3355 begat H3205 (8804) Almodad H0486, and Sheleph H8026, and Hazarmaveth H2700, and Jerah H3392,
010:027 And Hadoram H1913, and Uzal H0187, and Diklah H1853,
010:028 And Obal H5745, and Abimael H0039, and Sheba H7614,
010:029 And Ophir H0211, and Havilah H2341, and Jobab H3103: all these [were] the sons H1121 of Joktan H3355.
010:030 And their dwelling H4186 was from Mesha H4852, as thou goest H0935 (8800) unto Sephar H5611 a mount H2022 of the east H6924.
010:031 These [are] the sons H1121 of Shem H8035, after their families H4940, after their tongues H3956, in their lands H0776, after their nations H1471.
010:032 These [are] the families H4940 of the sons H1121 of Noah H5146, after their generations H8435, in their nations H1471: and by these were the nations H1471 divided H6504 (8738) in the earth H0776 after H0310 the flood H3999.
011:001 ¶ And the whole earth H0776 was of one H0259 language H8193, and of one H0259 speech H1697.
011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed H5265 (8800) from the east H6924, that they found H4672 (8799) a plain H1237 in the land H0776 of Shinar H8152; and they dwelt H3427 (8799) there.
011:003 And they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, Go to H3051 (8798), let us make H3835 (8799) brick H3843, and burn H8313 (8799) them throughly H8316. And they had brick H3843 for stone H0068, and slime H2564 had H1961 (8804) they for morter H2563.
011:004 And they said H0559 (8799), Go to H3051 (8798), let us build H1129 (8799) us a city H5892 and a tower H4026, whose top H7218 [may reach] unto heaven H8064; and let us make H6213 (8799) us a name H8034, lest we be scattered abroad H6327 (8799) upon the face H6440 of the whole earth H0776.
011:005 And the LORD H3068 came down H3381 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) the city H5892 and the tower H4026, which the children H1121 of men H0120 builded H1129 (8804).
011:006 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Behold, the people H5971 [is] one H0259, and they have all one H0259 language H8193; and this they begin H2490 (8687) to do H6213 (8800): and now nothing H3808 H3605 will be restrained H1219 (8735) from them, which they have imagined H2161 (8799) to do H6213 (8800).
011:007 Go to H3051 (8798), let us go down H3381 (8799), and there confound H1101 (8799) their language H8193, that H0834 they may not understand H8085 (8799) one H0376 another’s H7453 speech H8193.
011:008 So the LORD H3068 scattered them abroad H6327 (8686) from thence H8033 upon the face H6440 of all the earth H0776: and they left off H2308 (8799) to build H1129 (8800) the city H5892.
011:009 Therefore is the name of it H8034 called H7121 (8804) Babel H0894; because the LORD H3068 did there confound H1101 (8804) the language H8193 of all the earth H0776: and from thence did H6327 the LORD H3068 scatter them abroad H6327 (8689) upon the face H6440 of all the earth H0776.
011:010 These [are] the generations H8435 of Shem H8035: Shem H8035 [was] an hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121, and begat H3205 (8686) Arphaxad H0775 two years H8141 after H0310 the flood H3999:
011:011 And Shem H8035 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Arphaxad H0775 five H2568 hundred H3967 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:012 And Arphaxad H0775 lived H2425 (8804) five H2568 and thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Salah H7974:
011:013 And Arphaxad H0775 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Salah H7974 four H0702 hundred H3967 H8141 and three H7969 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:014 And Salah H7974 lived H2425 (8804) thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Eber H5677:
011:015 And Salah H7974 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Eber H5677 four H0702 hundred H3967 H8141 and three H7969 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:016 And Eber H5677 lived H2421 (8799) four H0702 and thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Peleg H6389:
011:017 And Eber H5677 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Peleg H6389 four H0702 hundred H3967 H8141 and thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:018 And Peleg H6389 lived H2421 (8799) thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Reu H7466:
011:019 And Peleg H6389 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Reu H7466 two hundred H3967 H8141 and nine H8672 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:020 And Reu H7466 lived H2421 (8799) two H8147 and thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Serug H8286:
011:021 And Reu H7466 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Serug H8286 two hundred H3967 H8141 and seven H7651 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:022 And Serug H8286 lived H2421 (8799) thirty H7970 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Nahor H5152:
011:023 And Serug H8286 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Nahor H5152 two hundred H3967 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:024 And Nahor H5152 lived H2421 (8799) nine H8672 and twenty H6242 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Terah H8646:
011:025 And Nahor H5152 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 he begat H3205 (8687) Terah H8646 an hundred H3967 H8141 and nineteen H6240 H8672 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
011:026 And Terah H8646 lived H2421 (8799) seventy H7657 years H8141, and begat H3205 (8686) Abram H0087, Nahor H5152, and Haran H2039.
011:027 Now these [are] the generations H8435 of Terah H8646: Terah H8646 begat H3205 (8689) Abram H0087, Nahor H5152, and Haran H2039; and Haran H2039 begat H3205 (8689) Lot H3876.
011:028 And Haran H2039 died H4191 (8799) before H6440 his father H0001 Terah H8646 in the land H0776 of his nativity H4138, in Ur H0218 of the Chaldees H3778.
011:029 And Abram H0087 and Nahor H5152 took H3947 (8799) them wives H0802: the name H8034 of Abram’s H0087 wife H0802 [was] Sarai H8297; and the name H8034 of Nahor’s H5152 wife H0802, Milcah H4435, the daughter H1323 of Haran H2039, the father H0001 of Milcah H4435, and the father H0001 of Iscah H3252.
011:030 But Sarai H8297 was barren H6135; she [had] no child H2056.
011:031 And Terah H8646 took H3947 (8799) Abram H0087 his son H1121, and Lot H3876 the son H1121 of Haran H2039 his son’s H1121 son H1121, and Sarai H8297 his daughter in law H3618, his son H1121 Abram’s H0087 wife H0802; and they went forth H3318 (8799) with them from Ur H0218 of the Chaldees H3778, to go H3212 (8800) into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; and they came H0935 (8799) unto Haran H2771, and dwelt H3427 (8799) there.
011:032 And the days H3117 of Terah H8646 were two hundred H3967 H8141 and five H2568 years H8141: and Terah H8646 died H4191 (8799) in Haran H2771.
012:001 ¶ Now the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8799) unto Abram H0087, Get thee out H3212 (8798) of thy country H0776, and from thy kindred H4138, and from thy father’s H0001 house H1004, unto a land H0776 that I will shew H7200 (8686) thee:
012:002 And I will make of thee H6213 (8799) a great H1419 nation H1471, and I will bless H1288 (8762) thee, and make H1431 thy name H8034 great H1431 (8762); and thou shalt be a blessing H1293:
012:003 And I will bless H1288 (8762) them that bless H1288 (8764) thee, and curse H0779 (8799) him that curseth H7043 (8764) thee: and in thee shall all families H4940 of the earth H0127 be blessed H1288 (8738).
012:004 So Abram H0087 departed H3212 (8799), as the LORD H3068 had spoken H1696 (8765) unto him; and Lot H3876 went H3212 (8799) with him: and Abram H0087 [was] seventy H7657 H8141 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he departed H3318 (8800) out of Haran H2771.
012:005 And Abram H0087 took H3947 (8799) Sarai H8297 his wife H0802, and Lot H3876 his brother’s H0251 son H1121, and all their substance H7399 that they had gathered H7408 (8804), and the souls H5315 that they had gotten H6213 (8804) in Haran H2771; and they went forth H3318 (8799) to go H3212 (8800) into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; and into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 they came H0935 (8799).
012:006 And Abram H0087 passed through H5674 (8799) the land H0776 unto the place H4725 of Sichem H7927, unto the plain H0436 of Moreh H4176. And the Canaanite H3669 [was] then H0227 in the land H0776.
012:007 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto Abram H0087, and said H0559 (8799), Unto thy seed H2233 will I give H5414 (8799) this H2063 land H0776: and there builded H1129 (8799) he an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068, who appeared H7200 (8737) unto him.
012:008 And he removed H6275 (8686) from thence unto a mountain H2022 on the east H6924 of Bethel H1008, and pitched H5186 (8799) his tent H0168, [having] Bethel H1008 on the west H3220, and Hai H5857 on the east H6924: and there he builded H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068, and called H7121 (8799) upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
012:009 And Abram H0087 journeyed H5265 (8799), going on H1980 (8800) still H5265 (8800) toward the south H5045.
012:010 And there was a famine H7458 in the land H0776: and Abram H0087 went down H3381 (8799) into Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there; for the famine H7458 [was] grievous H3515 in the land H0776.
012:011 And it came to pass, when H0834 he was come near H7126 (8689) to enter H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714, that he said H0559 (8799) unto Sarai H8297 his wife H0802, Behold H2009 now H4994, I know H3045 (8804) that thou [art] a fair H3303 woman H0802 to look upon H4758:
012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians H4713 shall see H7200 (8799) thee, that they shall say H0559 (8804), This [is] his wife H0802: and they will kill H2026 (8804) me, but they will save thee alive H2421 (8762).
012:013 Say H0559 (8798), I pray thee H4994, thou [art] my sister H0269: that H4616 it may be well H3190 (8799) with me for thy sake; and my soul H5315 shall live H2421 (8804) because of thee H1558.
012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram H0087 was come H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714, the Egyptians H4713 beheld H7200 (8799) the woman H0802 that she [was] very H3966 fair H3303.
012:015 The princes H8269 also of Pharaoh H6547 saw H7200 (8799) her, and commended H1984 (8762) her before H0413 Pharaoh H6547: and the woman H0802 was taken H3947 (8714) into Pharaoh’s H6547 house H1004.
012:016 And he entreated H3190 Abram H0087 well H3190 (8689) for her sake: and he had sheep H6629, and oxen H1241, and he asses H2543, and menservants H5650, and maidservants H8198, and she asses H0860, and camels H1581.
012:017 And the LORD H3068 plagued H5060 (8762) Pharaoh H6547 and his house H1004 with great H1419 plagues H5061 because of H1697 Sarai H8297 Abram’s H0087 wife H0802.
012:018 And Pharaoh H6547 called H7121 (8799) Abram H0087, and said H0559 (8799), What [is] this [that] thou hast done H6213 (8804) unto me? why didst thou not tell H5046 (8689) me that she [was] thy wife H0802?
012:019 Why saidst thou H0559 (8804), She [is] my sister H0269? so I might have taken H3947 (8799) her to me to wife H0802: now therefore behold thy wife H0802, take H3947 (8798) [her], and go thy way H3212 (8798).
012:020 And Pharaoh H6547 commanded H6680 (8762) [his] men H0582 concerning him: and they sent him away H7971 (8762), and his wife H0802, and all that he had.
013:001 ¶ And Abram H0087 went up H5927 (8799) out of Egypt H4714, he, and his wife H0802, and all that he had, and Lot H3876 with him, into the south H5045.
013:002 And Abram H0087 [was] very H3966 rich H3513 (8804) in cattle H4735, in silver H3701, and in gold H2091.
013:003 And he went H3212 (8799) on his journeys H4550 from the south H5045 even to Bethel H1008, unto the place H4725 where his tent H0168 had been H1961 (8804) at the beginning H8462, between Bethel H1008 and Hai H5857;
013:004 Unto the place H4725 of the altar H4196, which he had made H6213 (8804) there at the first H7223: and there Abram H0087 called H7121 (8799) on the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
013:005 And Lot H3876 also, which went H1980 (8802) with H0854 Abram H0087, had flocks H6629, and herds H1241, and tents H0168.
013:006 And the land H0776 was not able to bear H5375 (8804) them, that they might dwell H3427 (8800) together H3162: for their substance H7399 was great H7227, so that they could H3201 (8804) not dwell H3427 (8800) together H3162.
013:007 And there was a strife H7379 between the herdmen H7462 (8802) of Abram’s H0087 cattle H4735 and the herdmen H7462 (8802) of Lot’s H3876 cattle H4735: and the Canaanite H3669 and the Perizzite H6522 dwelled H3427 (8802) then in the land H0776.
013:008 And Abram H0087 said H0559 (8799) unto Lot H3876, Let there be H1961 (8799) no H0408 strife H4808, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen H7462 (8802) and thy herdmen H7462 (8802); for we H0582 [be] brethren H0251.
013:009 [Is] not the whole land H0776 before thee H6440? separate thyself H6504 (8734), I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand H8040, then I will go to the right H3231 (8686); or if [thou depart] to the right hand H3225, then I will go to the left H8041 (8686).
013:010 And Lot H3876 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and beheld H7200 (8799) all the plain H3603 of Jordan H3383, that it [was] well watered H4945 every where, before H6440 the LORD H3068 destroyed H7843 (8763) Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017, [even] as the garden H1588 of the LORD H3068, like the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, as thou comest H0935 (8800) unto Zoar H6820.
013:011 Then Lot H3876 chose H0977 (8799) him all the plain H3603 of Jordan H3383; and Lot H3876 journeyed H5265 (8799) east H6924: and they separated themselves H6504 (8735) the one H0376 from the other H0251.
013:012 Abram H0087 dwelled H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and Lot H3876 dwelled H3427 (8804) in the cities H5892 of the plain H3603, and pitched [his] tent H0167 (8799) toward H5704 Sodom H5467.
013:013 But the men H0582 of Sodom H5467 [were] wicked H7451 and sinners H2400 before the LORD H3068 exceedingly H3966.
013:014 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto Abram H0087, after H0310 that Lot H3876 was separated H6504 (8736) from him, Lift up H5375 (8798) now thine eyes H5869, and look H7200 (8798) from the place H4725 where thou art northward H6828, and southward H5045, and eastward H6924, and westward H3220:
013:015 For all the land H0776 which thou seest H7200 (8802), to thee will I give it H5414 (8799), and to thy seed H2233 for H5704 ever H5769.
013:016 And I will make H7760 (8804) thy seed H2233 as the dust H6083 of the earth H0776: so that H0834 if a man H0376 can H3201 (8799) number H4487 (8800) the dust H6083 of the earth H0776, [then] shall thy seed H2233 also be numbered H4487 (8735).
013:017 Arise H6965 (8798), walk H1980 (8690) through the land H0776 in the length H0753 of it and in the breadth H7341 of it; for I will give H5414 (8799) it unto thee.
013:018 Then Abram H0087 removed [his] tent H0167 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the plain H0436 of Mamre H4471, which [is] in Hebron H2275, and built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068.
014:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the days H3117 of Amraphel H0569 king H4428 of Shinar H8152, Arioch H0746 king H4428 of Ellasar H0495, Chedorlaomer H3540 king H4428 of Elam H5867, and Tidal H8413 king H4428 of nations H1471;
014:002 [That these] made H6213 (8804) war H4421 with H0854 Bera H1298 king H4428 of Sodom H5467, and with Birsha H1306 king H4428 of Gomorrah H6017, Shinab H8134 king H4428 of Admah H0126, and Shemeber H8038 king H4428 of Zeboiim H6636, and the king H4428 of Bela H1106, which is H1931 Zoar H6820.
014:003 All these were joined together H2266 (8804) in the vale H6010 of Siddim H7708, which H1931 is the salt H4417 sea H3220.
014:004 Twelve H6240 H8147 years H8141 they served H5647 (8804) H0853 Chedorlaomer H3540, and in the thirteenth H7969 H6240 year H8141 they rebelled H4775 (8804).
014:005 And in the fourteenth H6240 H0702 year H8141 came H0935 (8804) Chedorlaomer H3540, and the kings H4428 that [were] with him, and smote H5221 (8686) the Rephaims H7497 in Ashteroth Karnaim H6255, and the Zuzims H2104 in Ham H1990, and the Emims H0368 in Shaveh Kiriathaim H7741,
014:006 And the Horites H2752 in their mount H2042 Seir H8165, unto Elparan H0364, which [is] by H5921 the wilderness H4057.
014:007 And they returned H7725 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to H0413 Enmishpat H5880, which [is] Kadesh H6946, and smote H5221 (8686) all the country H7704 of the Amalekites H6003, and also the Amorites H0567, that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Hazezontamar H2688.
014:008 And there went out H3318 (8799) the king H4428 of Sodom H5467, and the king H4428 of Gomorrah H6017, and the king H4428 of Admah H0126, and the king H4428 of Zeboiim H6636, and the king H4428 of Bela H1106 (the same H1931 [is] Zoar H6820;) and they joined H6186 (8799) battle H4421 with them in the vale H6010 of Siddim H7708;
014:009 With Chedorlaomer H3540 the king H4428 of Elam H5867, and with Tidal H8413 king H4428 of nations H1471, and Amraphel H0569 king H4428 of Shinar H8152, and Arioch H0746 king H4428 of Ellasar H0495; four H0702 kings H4428 with five H2568.
014:010 And the vale H6010 of Siddim H7708 [was full of] H0875 slimepits H0875 H2564; and the kings H4428 of Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017 fled H5127 (8799), and fell H5307 (8799) there; and they that remained H7604 (8737) fled H5127 (8804) to the mountain H2022.
014:011 And they took H3947 (8799) all the goods H7399 of Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017, and all their victuals H0400, and went their way H3212 (8799).
014:012 And they took H3947 (8799) Lot H3876, Abram’s H0087 brother’s H0251 son H1121, who dwelt H3427 (8802) in Sodom H5467, and his goods H7399, and departed H3212 (8799).
014:013 And there came H0935 (8799) one that had escaped H6412, and told H5046 (8686) Abram H0087 the Hebrew H5680; for he dwelt H7931 (8802) in the plain H0436 of Mamre H4471 the Amorite H0567, brother H0251 of Eshcol H0812, and brother H0251 of Aner H6063: and these [were] confederate H1167 H1285 with Abram H0087.
014:014 And when Abram H0087 heard H8085 (8799) that his brother H0251 was taken captive H7617 (8738), he armed H7324 (8686) his trained H2593 [servants], born H3211 in his own house H1004, three H7969 hundred H3967 and eighteen H6240 H8083, and pursued H7291 (8799) [them] unto Dan H1835.
014:015 And he divided H2505 (8735) himself against them, he and his servants H5650, by night H3915, and smote H5221 (8686) them, and pursued H7291 (8799) them unto Hobah H2327, which [is] on the left hand H8040 of Damascus H1834.
014:016 And he brought back H7725 (8686) all the goods H7399, and also brought again H7725 (8689) his brother H0251 Lot H3876, and his goods H7399, and the women H0802 also, and the people H5971.
014:017 And the king H4428 of Sodom H5467 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him after H0310 his return H7725 (8800) from the slaughter H5221 (8687) of Chedorlaomer H3540, and of the kings H4428 that [were] with him, at the valley H6010 of Shaveh H7740, which H1931 [is] the king’s H4428 dale H6010.
014:018 And Melchizedek H4442 king H4428 of Salem H8004 brought forth H3318 (8689) bread H3899 and wine H3196: and he [was] the priest H3548 of the most high H5945 God H0410.
014:019 And he blessed H1288 (8762) him, and said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] Abram H0087 of the most high H5945 God H0410, possessor H7069 (8802) of heaven H8064 and earth H0776:
014:020 And blessed H1288 (8803) be the most high H5945 God H0410, which hath delivered H4042 (8765) thine enemies H6862 into thy hand H3027. And he gave H5414 (8799) him tithes H4643 of all.
014:021 And the king H4428 of Sodom H5467 said H0559 (8799) unto Abram H0087, Give H5414 (8798) me the persons H5315, and take H3947 (8798) the goods H7399 to thyself.
014:022 And Abram H0087 said H0559 (8799) to the king H4428 of Sodom H5467, I have lift up H7311 (8689) mine hand H3027 unto the LORD H3068, the most high H5945 God H0410, the possessor H7069 (8802) of heaven H8064 and earth H0776,
014:023 That I will not H0518 [take] from a thread H2339 even to a shoelatchet H5275 H8288, and that I will not H0518 take H3947 (8799) any thing that [is] thine, lest thou shouldest say H0559 (8799), I have made H6238 Abram H0087 rich H6238 (8689):
014:024 Save H1107 only that which H0834 the young men H5288 have eaten H0398 (8804), and the portion H2506 of the men H0582 which went H1980 (8804) with H0854 me, Aner H6063, Eshcol H0812, and Mamre H4471; let them H1992 take H3947 (8799) their portion H2506.
015:001 ¶ After H0310 these things H1697 the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came H1961 (8804) unto Abram H0087 in a vision H4236, saying H0559 (8800), Fear H3372 (8799) not, Abram H0087: I [am] thy shield H4043, [and] thy exceeding H3966 great H7235 (8687) reward H7939.
015:002 And Abram H0087 said H0559 (8799), Lord H0136 GOD H3069, what wilt thou give H5414 (8799) me, seeing I go H1980 (8802) childless H6185, and the steward H1121 H4943 of my house H1004 [is] this H1931 Eliezer H0461 of Damascus H1834?
015:003 And Abram H0087 said H0559 (8799), Behold, to me thou hast given H5414 (8804) no H3808 seed H2233: and, lo, one born H1121 in my house H1004 is mine heir H3423 (8802).
015:004 And, behold, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 [came] unto him, saying H0559 (8800), This shall not be thine heir H3423 (8799); but he that shall come forth H3318 (8799) out of thine own bowels H4578 shall be thine heir H3423 (8799).
015:005 And he brought him forth H3318 (8686) abroad H2351, and said H0559 (8799), Look H5027 (8685) now toward heaven H8064, and tell H5608 (8798) the stars H3556, if thou be able H3201 (8799) to number H5608 (8800) them: and he said H0559 (8799) unto him, So H3541 shall thy seed H2233 be.
015:006 And he believed H0539 (8689) in the LORD H3068; and he counted H2803 (8799) it to him for righteousness H6666.
015:007 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, I [am] the LORD H3068 that brought thee out H3318 (8689) of Ur H0218 of the Chaldees H3778, to give H5414 (8800) thee this land H0776 to inherit H3423 (8800) it.
015:008 And he said H0559 (8799), Lord H0136 GOD H3069, whereby H4100 shall I know H3045 (8799) that I shall inherit it H3423 (8799)?
015:009 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Take H3947 (8798) me an heifer H5697 of three years old H8027 (8794), and a she goat H5795 of three years old H8027 (8794), and a ram H0352 of three years old H8027 (8794), and a turtledove H8449, and a young pigeon H1469.
015:010 And he took H3947 (8799) unto him all these, and divided H1334 (8762) them in the midst H8432, and laid H5414 (8799) each H0376 piece H1335 one against H7125 (8800) another H7453: but the birds H6833 divided H1334 (8804) he not.
015:011 And when the fowls H5861 came down H3381 (8799) upon the carcases H6297, Abram H0087 drove them away H5380 (8686).
015:012 And when the sun H8121 was going down H0935 (8800), a deep sleep H8639 fell H5307 (8804) upon Abram H0087; and, lo, an horror H0367 of great H1419 darkness H2825 fell H5307 (8802) upon him.
015:013 And he said H0559 (8799) unto Abram H0087, Know H3045 (8799) of a surety H3045 (8800) that thy seed H2233 shall be a stranger H1616 in a land H0776 [that is] not theirs, and shall serve H5647 (8804) them; and they shall afflict H6031 (8765) them four H0702 hundred H3967 years H8141;
015:014 And also that nation H1471, whom they shall serve H5647 (8799), will I judge H1777 (8802): and afterward H0310 H3651 shall they come out H3318 (8799) with great H1419 substance H7399.
015:015 And thou shalt go H0935 (8799) to thy fathers H0001 in peace H7965; thou shalt be buried H6912 (8735) in a good H2896 old age H7872.
015:016 But in the fourth H7243 generation H1755 they shall come hither H2008 again H7725 (8799): for the iniquity H5771 of the Amorites H0567 [is] not yet H2008 full H8003.
015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun H8121 went down H0935 (8804), and it was dark H5939, behold a smoking H6227 furnace H8574, and a burning H0784 lamp H3940 that passed H5674 (8804) between H0996 those pieces H1506.
015:018 In the same H1931 day H3117 the LORD H3068 made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with Abram H0087, saying H0559 (8800), Unto thy seed H2233 have I given H5414 (8804) this land H0776, from the river H5104 of Egypt H4714 unto the great H1419 river H5104, the river H5104 Euphrates H6578:
015:019 The Kenites H7017, and the Kenizzites H7074, and the Kadmonites H6935,
015:020 And the Hittites H2850, and the Perizzites H6522, and the Rephaims H7497,
015:021 And the Amorites H0567, and the Canaanites H3669, and the Girgashites H1622, and the Jebusites H2983.
016:001 ¶ Now Sarai H8297 Abram’s H0087 wife H0802 bare H3205 him no H3808 children H3205 (8804): and she had an handmaid H8198, an Egyptian H4713, whose name H8034 [was] Hagar H1904.
016:002 And Sarai H8297 said H0559 (8799) unto Abram H0087, Behold now, the LORD H3068 hath restrained me H6113 (8804) from bearing H3205 (8800): I pray thee, go in H0935 (8798) unto my maid H8198; it may H0194 be that I may obtain children H1129 (8735) by her. And Abram H0087 hearkened H8085 (8799) to the voice H6963 of Sarai H8297.
016:003 And Sarai H8297 Abram’s H0087 wife H0802 took H3947 (8799) Hagar H1904 her maid H8198 the Egyptian H4713, after H7093 Abram H0087 had dwelt H3427 (8800) ten H6235 years H8141 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and gave H5414 (8799) her to her husband H0376 Abram H0087 to be his wife H0802.
016:004 And he went in H0935 (8799) unto Hagar H1904, and she conceived H2029 (8799): and when she saw H7200 (8799) that she had conceived H2029 (8804), her mistress H1404 was despised H7043 (8799) in her eyes H5869.
016:005 And Sarai H8297 said H0559 (8799) unto Abram H0087, My wrong H2555 [be] upon thee: I have given H5414 (8804) my maid H8198 into thy bosom H2436; and when she saw H7200 (8799) that she had conceived H2029 (8804), I was despised H7043 (8799) in her eyes H5869: the LORD H3068 judge H8199 (8799) between me and thee.
016:006 But Abram H0087 said H0559 (8799) unto Sarai H8297, Behold, thy maid H8198 [is] in thy hand H3027; do H6213 (8798) to her as it pleaseth thee H2896 H5869. And when Sarai H8297 dealt hardly with H6031 (8762) her, she fled H1272 (8799) from her face H6440.
016:007 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 found her H4672 (8799) by a fountain H5869 of water H4325 in the wilderness H4057, by the fountain H5869 in the way H1870 to Shur H7793.
016:008 And he said H0559 (8799), Hagar H1904, Sarai’s H8297 maid H8198, whence H0335 camest thou H0935 (8804)? and whither wilt thou go H3212 (8799)? And she said H0559 (8799), I flee H1272 (8802) from the face H6440 of my mistress H1404 Sarai H8297.
016:009 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Return H7725 (8798) to thy mistress H1404, and submit H6031 (8690) thyself under her hands H3027.
016:010 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto her, I will multiply H7235 (8686) thy seed H2233 exceedingly H7235 (8687), that it shall not be numbered H5608 (8735) for multitude H7230.
016:011 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Behold H2009, thou [art] with child H2030, and shalt bear H3205 (8802) a son H1121, and shalt call H7121 (8804) his name H8034 Ishmael H3458; because the LORD H3068 hath heard H8085 (8804) thy affliction H6040.
016:012 And he will be a wild H6501 man H0120; his hand H3027 [will be] against every man, and every man’s hand H3027 against him; and he shall dwell H7931 (8799) in the presence H6440 of all his brethren H0251.
016:013 And she called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 that spake H1696 (8802) unto her, Thou God H0410 seest me H7210: for she said H0559 (8804), Have I also here H1988 looked H7200 (8804) after him H0310 that seeth me H7210?
016:014 Wherefore the well H0875 was called H7121 (8804) Beerlahairoi H0883 H2416; behold, [it is] between Kadesh H6946 and Bered H1260.
016:015 And Hagar H1904 bare H3205 (8799) Abram H0087 a son H1121: and Abram H0087 called H7121 (8799) his son’s H1121 name H8034, which Hagar H1904 bare H3205 (8804), Ishmael H3458.
016:016 And Abram H0087 [was] fourscore H8084 H8141 and six H8337 years H8141 old H1121, when Hagar H1904 bare H3205 (8800) Ishmael H3458 to Abram H0087.
017:001 ¶ And when Abram H0087 was ninety H8673 H8141 years H8141 old H1121 and nine H8672, the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) to Abram H0087, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, I [am] the Almighty H7706 God H0410; walk H1980 (8690) before me H6440, and be thou perfect H8549.
017:002 And I will make H5414 (8799) my covenant H1285 between me and thee, and will multiply H7235 (8686) thee exceedingly H3966 H3966.
017:003 And Abram H0087 fell H5307 (8799) on his face H6440: and God H0430 talked H1696 (8762) with him, saying H0559 (8800),
017:004 As for me H0589, behold, my covenant H1285 [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father H0001 of many H1995 nations H1471.
017:005 Neither shall thy name H8034 any more be called H7121 (8735) Abram H0087, but thy name H8034 shall be Abraham H0085; for a father H0001 of many H1995 nations H1471 have I made thee H5414 (8804).
017:006 And I will make H6509 thee exceeding H3966 H3966 fruitful H6509 (8689), and I will make H5414 (8804) nations H1471 of thee, and kings H4428 shall come out H3318 (8799) of thee.
017:007 And I will establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285 between me and thee and thy seed H2233 after thee H0310 in their generations H1755 for an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285, to be a God H0430 unto thee, and to thy seed H2233 after thee H0310.
017:008 And I will give H5414 (8804) unto thee, and to thy seed H2233 after thee H0310, the land H0776 wherein thou art a stranger H4033, all the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, for an everlasting H5769 possession H0272; and I will be their God H0430.
017:009 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, Thou shalt keep H8104 (8799) my covenant H1285 therefore, thou, and thy seed H2233 after thee H0310 in their generations H1755.
017:010 This [is] my covenant H1285, which ye shall keep H8104 (8799), between me and you and thy seed H2233 after thee H0310; Every man child H2145 among you shall be circumcised H4135 (8736).
017:011 And ye shall circumcise H5243 (8804) the flesh H1320 of your foreskin H6190; and it shall be a token H0226 of the covenant H1285 betwixt me and you.
017:012 And he that is eight H8083 days H3117 old H1121 shall be circumcised H4135 (8735) among you, every man child H2145 in your generations H1755, he that is born H3211 in the house H1004, or bought H4736 with money H3701 of any stranger H1121 H5236, which [is] not of thy seed H2233.
017:013 He that is born H3211 in thy house H1004, and he that is bought H4736 with thy money H3701, must needs H4135 (8736) be circumcised H4135 (8735): and my covenant H1285 shall be in your flesh H1320 for an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285.
017:014 And the uncircumcised H6189 man child H2145 whose H0834 flesh H1320 of his foreskin H6190 is not circumcised H4135 (8735), that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from his people H5971; he hath broken H6565 (8689) my covenant H1285.
017:015 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, As for Sarai H8297 thy wife H0802, thou shalt not call H7121 (8799) her name H8034 Sarai H8297, but H3588 Sarah H8283 [shall] her name H8034 [be].
017:016 And I will bless H1288 (8765) her, and give H5414 (8804) thee a son H1121 also of her: yea, I will bless H1288 (8765) her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations H1471; kings H4428 of people H5971 shall be of her.
017:017 Then Abraham H0085 fell H5307 (8799) upon his face H6440, and laughed H6711 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) in his heart H3820, Shall [a child] be born H3205 (8735) unto him that is an hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121? and shall Sarah H8283, that is ninety H8673 years H8141 old H1323, bear H3205 (8799)?
017:018 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, O that H3863 Ishmael H3458 might live H2421 (8799) before thee H6440!
017:019 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Sarah H8283 thy wife H0802 shall bear H3205 (8802) thee a son H1121 indeed H0061; and thou shalt call H7121 (8804) his name H8034 Isaac H3327: and I will establish H6965 (8689) my covenant H1285 with him for an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285, [and] with his seed H2233 after him H0310.
017:020 And as for Ishmael H3458, I have heard thee H8085 (8804): Behold, I have blessed H1288 (8765) him, and will make him fruitful H6509 (8689), and will multiply H7235 (8689) him exceedingly H3966 H3966; twelve H6240 H8147 princes H5387 shall he beget H3205 (8686), and I will make him H5414 (8804) a great H1419 nation H1471.
017:021 But my covenant H1285 will I establish H6965 (8686) with Isaac H3327, which Sarah H8283 shall bear H3205 (8799) unto thee at this set time H4150 in the next H0312 year H8141.
017:022 And he left off H3615 (8762) talking H1696 (8763) with him, and God H0430 went up H5927 (8799) from Abraham H0085.
017:023 And Abraham H0085 took H3947 (8799) Ishmael H3458 his son H1121, and all that were born H3211 in his house H1004, and all that were bought H4736 with his money H3701, every male H2145 among the men H0582 of Abraham’s H0085 house H1004; and circumcised H4135 (8799) the flesh H1320 of their foreskin H6190 in the selfsame H6106 day H3117, as God H0430 had said H1696 (8765) unto him.
017:024 And Abraham H0085 [was] ninety H8673 years H8141 old H1121 and nine H8672, when he was circumcised H4135 (8736) in the flesh H1320 of his foreskin H6190.
017:025 And Ishmael H3458 his son H1121 [was] thirteen H6240 H7969 years H8141 old H1121, when he was circumcised H4135 (8736) in the flesh H1320 of his foreskin H6190.
017:026 In the selfsame H6106 day H3117 was Abraham H0085 circumcised H4135 (8738), and Ishmael H3458 his son H1121.
017:027 And all the men H0582 of his house H1004, born H3211 in the house H1004, and bought H4736 with money H3701 of the stranger H1121 H5236, were circumcised H4135 (8738) with him.
018:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto him in the plains H0436 of Mamre H4471: and he sat H3427 (8802) in the tent H0168 door H6607 in the heat H2527 of the day H3117;
018:002 And he lift up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869 and looked H7200 (8799), and, lo, three H7969 men H0582 stood H5324 (8737) by him: and when he saw H7200 (8799) [them], he ran H7323 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them from the tent H0168 door H6607, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself toward the ground H0776,
018:003 And said H0559 (8799), My Lord H0136, if now I have found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in thy sight H5869, pass not away H5674 (8799), I pray thee, from thy servant H5650:
018:004 Let a little H4592 water H4325, I pray you H4994, be fetched H3947 (8714), and wash H7364 (8798) your feet H7272, and rest yourselves H8172 (8734) under the tree H6086:
018:005 And I will fetch H3947 (8799) a morsel H6595 of bread H3899, and comfort ye H5582 (8798) your hearts H3820; after that H0310 ye shall pass on H5674 (8799): for therefore are ye come H5674 (8804) to H5921 your servant H5650. And they said H1696 (8765), So do H6213 (8799), as thou hast said H0559 (8799).
018:006 And Abraham H0085 hastened H4116 (8762) into the tent H0168 unto Sarah H8283, and said H0559 (8799), Make ready quickly H4116 (8761) three H7969 measures H5429 of fine H5560 meal H7058, knead H3888 (8798) [it], and make H6213 cakes H5692 upon the hearth H6213 (8798).
018:007 And Abraham H0085 ran H7323 (8804) unto the herd H1241, and fetcht H3947 (8799) a calf H1121 H1241 tender H7390 and good H2896, and gave H5414 (8799) [it] unto a young man H5288; and he hasted H4116 (8762) to dress H6213 (8800) it.
018:008 And he took H3947 (8799) butter H2529, and milk H2461, and the calf H1121 H1241 which he had dressed H6213 (8804), and set H5414 (8799) [it] before them H6440; and he stood H5975 (8802) by them under the tree H6086, and they did eat H0398 (8799).
018:009 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Where H0346 [is] Sarah H8283 thy wife H0802? And he said H0559 (8799), Behold, in the tent H0168.
018:010 And he said H0559 (8799), I will certainly H7725 (8800) return H7725 (8799) unto thee according to the time H6256 of life H2416; and, lo, Sarah H8283 thy wife H0802 shall have a son H1121. And Sarah H8283 heard H8085 (8802) [it] in the tent H0168 door H6607, which [was] behind him H0310.
018:011 Now Abraham H0085 and Sarah H8283 [were] old H2205 [and] well stricken H0935 (8802) in age H3117; [and] it ceased H2308 (8804) to be with Sarah H8283 after the manner H0734 of women H0802.
018:012 Therefore Sarah H8283 laughed H6711 (8799) within herself H7130, saying H0559 (8800), After H0310 I am waxed old H1086 (8800) shall I have pleasure H5730, my lord H0113 being old also H2204 (8804)?
018:013 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, Wherefore H4100 did Sarah H8283 laugh H6711 (8804), saying H0559 (8800), Shall I of a surety H0552 bear H3205 (8799) a child, which H0589 am old H2204 (8804)?
018:014 Is H6381 any thing H1697 too hard H6381 (8735) for the LORD H3068? At the time appointed H4150 I will return H7725 (8799) unto thee, according to the time H6256 of life H2416, and Sarah H8283 shall have a son H1121.
018:015 Then Sarah H8283 denied H3584 (8762), saying H0559 (8800), I laughed H6711 (8804) not; for she was afraid H3372 (8804). And he said H0559 (8799), Nay H3808; but thou didst laugh H6711 (8804).
018:016 And the men H0582 rose up H6965 (8799) from thence, and looked H8259 (8686) toward H6440 Sodom H5467: and Abraham H0085 went H1980 (8802) with them to bring them on the way H7971 (8763).
018:017 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804), Shall I hide H3680 (8764) from Abraham H0085 that thing which H0834 I do H6213 (8802);
018:018 Seeing that Abraham H0085 shall surely become a great H1419 and mighty H6099 nation H1471, and all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776 shall be blessed H1288 (8738) in him?
018:019 For I know H3045 (8804) him, that H0834 he will command H6680 (8762) his children H1121 and his household H1004 after him H0310, and they shall keep H8104 (8804) the way H1870 of the LORD H3068, to do H6213 (8800) justice H6666 and judgment H4941; that the LORD H3068 may bring H0935 (8687) upon Abraham H0085 that which he hath spoken H1696 (8765) of him.
018:020 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Because the cry H2201 of Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017 is great H7227, and because their sin H2403 is very H3966 grievous H3513 (8804);
018:021 I will go down H3381 (8799) now, and see H7200 (8799) whether they have done H6213 (8804) altogether H3617 according to the cry H6818 of it, which is come H0935 (8802) unto me; and if not, I will know H3045 (8799).
018:022 And the men H0582 turned their faces H6437 (8799) from thence, and went H3212 (8799) toward Sodom H5467: but Abraham H0085 stood H5975 (8802) yet H5750 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
018:023 And Abraham H0085 drew near H5066 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Wilt thou also destroy H5595 (8799) the righteous H6662 with H5973 the wicked H7563?
018:024 Peradventure there be H3426 fifty H2572 righteous H6662 within H8432 the city H5892: wilt thou also destroy H5595 (8799) and not spare H5375 (8799) the place H4725 for H4616 the fifty H2572 righteous H6662 that [are] therein H7130?
018:025 That be far H2486 from thee to do H6213 (8800) after this manner H1697, to slay H4191 (8687) the righteous H6662 with the wicked H7563: and that the righteous H6662 should be as the wicked H7563, that be far H2486 from thee: Shall not the Judge H8199 (8802) of all the earth H0776 do H6213 (8799) right H4941?
018:026 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), If I find H4672 (8799) in Sodom H5467 fifty H2572 righteous H6662 within H8432 the city H5892, then I will spare H5375 (8804) all the place H4725 for their sakes.
018:027 And Abraham H0085 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Behold now, I have taken upon me H2974 (8689) to speak H1696 (8763) unto the Lord H0136, which H0595 [am but] dust H6083 and ashes H0665:
018:028 Peradventure there shall lack H2637 (8799) five H2568 of the fifty H2572 righteous H6662: wilt thou destroy H7843 (8686) all the city H5892 for [lack of] five H2568? And he said H0559 (8799), If I find H4672 (8799) there forty H0705 and five H2568, I will not destroy H7843 (8686) [it].
018:029 And he spake H1696 (8763) unto him yet again H3254 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), Peradventure there shall be forty H0705 found H4672 (8735) there. And he said H0559 (8799), I will not do H6213 (8799) [it] for forty’s H0705 sake.
018:030 And he said H0559 (8799) [unto him], Oh H4994 let not the Lord H0136 be angry H2734 (8799), and I will speak H1696 (8762): Peradventure there shall thirty H7970 be found H4672 (8735) there. And he said H0559 (8799), I will not do H6213 (8799) [it], if I find H4672 (8799) thirty H7970 there.
018:031 And he said H0559 (8799), Behold now, I have taken upon me H2974 (8689) to speak H1696 (8763) unto the Lord H0136: Peradventure there shall be twenty H6242 found H4672 (8735) there. And he said H0559 (8799), I will not destroy H7843 (8686) [it] for twenty’s H6242 sake.
018:032 And he said H0559 (8799), Oh let not the Lord H0136 be angry H2734 (8799), and I will speak H1696 (8762) yet H0389 but this once H6471: Peradventure ten H6235 shall be found H4672 (8735) there. And he said H0559 (8799), I will not destroy H7843 (8686) [it] for ten’s H6235 sake.
018:033 And the LORD H3068 went his way H3212 (8799), as soon as H0834 he had left H3615 (8765) communing H1696 (8763) with Abraham H0085: and Abraham H0085 returned H7725 (8804) unto his place H4725.
019:001 ¶ And there came H0935 (8799) two H8147 angels H4397 to Sodom H5467 at even H6153; and Lot H3876 sat H3427 (8802) in the gate H8179 of Sodom H5467: and Lot H3876 seeing H7200 (8799) [them] rose up H6965 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them; and he bowed H7812 (8691) himself with his face H0639 toward the ground H0776;
019:002 And he said H0559 (8799), Behold now, my lords H0113, turn in H5493 (8798), I pray you, into your servant’s H5650 house H1004, and tarry all night H3885 (8798), and wash H7364 (8798) your feet H7272, and ye shall rise up early H7925 (8689), and go H1980 (8804) on your ways H1870. And they said H0559 (8799), Nay; but we will abide H3885 in the street H7339 all night H3885 (8799).
019:003 And he pressed H6484 (8799) upon them greatly H3966; and they turned in H5493 (8799) unto him, and entered H0935 (8799) into his house H1004; and he made H6213 (8799) them a feast H4960, and did bake H0644 (8804) unleavened bread H4682, and they did eat H0398 (8799).
019:004 But before they lay down H7901 (8799), the men H0582 of the city H5892, [even] the men H0582 of Sodom H5467, compassed H5437 the house H1004 round H5437 (8738), both old H2205 and young H5288, all the people H5971 from every quarter H7097:
019:005 And they called H7121 (8799) unto Lot H3876, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Where [are] the men H0582 which came in H0935 (8804) to thee this night H3915? bring them out H3318 (8685) unto us, that we may know H3045 (8799) them.
019:006 And Lot H3876 went out H3318 (8799) at the door H6607 unto them, and shut H5462 (8804) the door H1817 after him H0310,
019:007 And said H0559 (8799), I pray you, brethren H0251, do not so wickedly H7489 (8686).
019:008 Behold now, I have two H8147 daughters H1323 which have not known H3045 (8804) man H0376; let me, I pray you, bring them out H3318 (8686) unto you, and do H6213 (8798) ye to them as [is] good H2896 in your eyes H5869: only unto these H0411 men H0582 do H6213 (8799) nothing H0408 H1697; for therefore came H0935 (8804) they under the shadow H6738 of my roof H6982.
019:009 And they said H0559 (8799), Stand H5066 (8798) back H1973. And they said H0559 (8799) [again], This one H0259 [fellow] came in H0935 (8804) to sojourn H1481 (8800), and he will needs H8199 (8800) be a judge H8199 (8799): now will we deal worse H7489 (8686) with thee, than with them. And they pressed H6484 (8799) sore H3966 upon the man H0376, [even] Lot H3876, and came near H5066 (8799) to break H7665 (8800) the door H1817.
019:010 But the men H0582 put forth H7971 (8799) their hand H3027, and pulled H0935 (8686) Lot H3876 into the house H1004 to them, and shut H5462 (8804) to the door H1817.
019:011 And they smote H5221 (8689) the men H0582 that [were] at the door H6607 of the house H1004 with blindness H5575, both small H6996 and great H1419: so that they wearied H3811 (8799) themselves to find H4672 (8800) the door H6607.
019:012 And the men H0582 said H0559 (8799) unto Lot H3876, Hast thou here H6311 any H4310 besides? son in law H2860, and thy sons H1121, and thy daughters H1323, and whatsoever H0834 thou hast in the city H5892, bring [them] out H3318 (8685) of this place H4725:
019:013 For we H0587 will destroy H7843 (8688) H0853 this place H4725, because the cry of them H6818 is waxen great H1431 (8804) before H0854 the face H6440 of the LORD H3068; and the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8762) us to destroy H7843 (8763) it.
019:014 And Lot H3876 went out H3318 (8799), and spake H1696 (8762) unto his sons in law H2860, which married H3947 (8802) his daughters H1323, and said H0559 (8799), Up H6965 (8798), get you out H3318 (8798) of this place H4725; for the LORD H3068 will destroy H7843 (8688) this city H5892. But he seemed as one that mocked H6711 (8764) unto H5869 his sons in law H2860.
019:015 And when H3644 the morning H7837 arose H5927 (8804), then the angels H4397 hastened H0213 (8686) Lot H3876, saying H0559 (8800), Arise H6965 (8798), take H3947 (8798) thy wife H0802, and thy two H8147 daughters H1323, which are here H4672 (8737); lest thou be consumed H5595 (8735) in the iniquity H5771 of the city H5892.
019:016 And while he lingered H4102 (8698), the men H0582 laid hold H2388 (8686) upon his hand H3027, and upon the hand H3027 of his wife H0802, and upon the hand H3027 of his two H8147 daughters H1323; the LORD H3068 being merciful H2551 unto him: and they brought him forth H3318 (8686), and set him H3240 (8686) without H2351 the city H5892.
019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth H3318 (8687) abroad H2351, that he said H0559 (8799), Escape H4422 (8734) for H5921 thy life H5315; look H5027 (8686) not behind thee H0310, neither stay H5975 (8799) thou in all the plain H3603; escape H4422 (8734) to the mountain H2022, lest thou be consumed H5595 (8735).
019:018 And Lot H3876 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord H0113:
019:019 Behold now, thy servant H5650 hath found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, and thou hast magnified H1431 (8686) thy mercy H2617, which thou hast shewed H6213 (8804) unto me H5978 in saving H2421 (8687) my life H5315; and I cannot H3201 (8799) escape H4422 (8736) to the mountain H2022, lest some evil H7451 take H1692 (8799) me, and I die H4191 (8804):
019:020 Behold now, this city H5892 [is] near H7138 to flee H5127 (8800) unto, and it H1931 [is] a little one H4705: Oh, let me escape H4422 (8735) thither, ([is] it not a little one H4705?) and my soul H5315 shall live H2421 (8799).
019:021 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, See H2009, I have accepted H5375 (8804) thee H6440 concerning this thing H1697 also, that I will not overthrow H2015 (8800) this city H5892, for the which H0834 thou hast spoken H1696 (8765).
019:022 Haste H4116 (8761) thee, escape H4422 (8734) thither; for I cannot H3201 (8799) do H6213 (8800) any thing H1697 till thou be come H0935 (8800) thither. Therefore the name H8034 of the city H5892 was called H7121 (8804) Zoar H6820.
019:023 The sun H8121 was risen H3318 (8804) upon the earth H0776 when Lot H3876 entered H0935 (8804) into Zoar H6820.
019:024 Then the LORD H3068 rained H4305 (8689) upon Sodom H5467 and upon Gomorrah H6017 brimstone H1614 and fire H0784 from the LORD H3068 out of heaven H8064;
019:025 And he overthrew H2015 (8799) those H0411 cities H5892, and all the plain H3603, and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the cities H5892, and that which grew H6780 upon the ground H0127.
019:026 But his wife H0802 looked back H5027 (8686) from behind him H0310, and she became a pillar H5333 of salt H4417.
019:027 And Abraham H0085 gat up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242 to the place H4725 where he stood H5975 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068:
019:028 And he looked H8259 (8686) toward H6440 Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017, and toward H6440 all the land H0776 of the plain H3603, and beheld H7200 (8799), and, lo, the smoke H7008 of the country H0776 went up H5927 (8804) as the smoke H7008 of a furnace H3536.
019:029 And it came to pass, when God H0430 destroyed H7843 (8763) the cities H5892 of the plain H3603, that God H0430 remembered H2142 (8799) Abraham H0085, and sent H7971 (8762) Lot H3876 out of the midst H8432 of the overthrow H2018, when he overthrew H2015 (8800) the cities H5892 in the which H2004 Lot H3876 dwelt H3427 (8804).
019:030 And Lot H3876 went up H5927 (8799) out of Zoar H6820, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the mountain H2022, and his two H8147 daughters H1323 with him; for he feared H3372 (8804) to dwell H3427 (8800) in Zoar H6820: and he dwelt H3427 (8799) in a cave H4631, he and his two H8147 daughters H1323.
019:031 And the firstborn H1067 said H0559 (8799) unto the younger H6810, Our father H0001 [is] old H2204 (8804), and [there is] not a man H0376 in the earth H0776 to come in H0935 (8800) unto us after the manner H1870 of all the earth H0776:
019:032 Come H3212 (8798), let us make H8248 our father H0001 drink H8248 (8686) wine H3196, and we will lie H7901 (8799) with him, that we may preserve H2421 (8762) seed H2233 of our father H0001.
019:033 And they made H8248 their father H0001 drink H8248 (8686) wine H3196 that night H3915: and the firstborn H1067 went in H0935 (8799), and lay H7901 (8799) with her father H0001; and he perceived H3045 (8804) not when she lay down H7901 (8800), nor when she arose H6965 (8800).
019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that the firstborn H1067 said H0559 (8799) unto the younger H6810, Behold, I lay H7901 (8804) yesternight H0570 with my father H0001: let us make him drink H8248 (8686) wine H3196 this night H3915 also; and go thou in H0935 (8798), [and] lie H7901 (8798) with him, that we may preserve H2421 (8762) seed H2233 of our father H0001.
019:035 And they made H8248 their father H0001 drink H8248 (8686) wine H3196 that H1931 night H3915 also: and the younger H6810 arose H6965 (8799), and lay H7901 (8799) with him; and he perceived H3045 (8804) not when she lay down H7901 (8800), nor when she arose H6965 (8800).
019:036 Thus were both H8147 the daughters H1323 of Lot H3876 with child H2029 (8799) by their father H0001.
019:037 And the firstborn H1067 bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Moab H4124: the same H1931 [is] the father H0001 of the Moabites H4124 unto this day H3117.
019:038 And the younger H6810, she also bare H3205 (8804) a son H1121, and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Benammi H1151: the same [is] the father H0001 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 unto this day H3117.
020:001 ¶ And Abraham H0085 journeyed H5265 (8799) from thence toward the south H5045 country H0776, and dwelled H3427 (8799) between Kadesh H6946 and Shur H7793, and sojourned H1481 (8799) in Gerar H1642.
020:002 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799) of H0413 Sarah H8283 his wife H0802, She [is] my sister H0269: and Abimelech H0040 king H4428 of Gerar H1642 sent H7971 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) Sarah H8283.
020:003 But God H0430 came H0935 (8799) to Abimelech H0040 in a dream H2472 by night H3915, and said H0559 (8799) to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man H4191 (8801), for the woman H0802 which thou hast taken H3947 (8804); for she [is] a man’s H1167 wife H1166 (8803).
020:004 But Abimelech H0040 had not come near H7126 (8804) her: and he said H0559 (8799), Lord H0136, wilt thou slay H2026 (8799) also a righteous H6662 nation H1471?
020:005 Said H0559 (8804) he not unto me, She H1931 [is] my sister H0269? and she H1931, even H1571 she H1931 herself said H0559 (8804), He [is] my brother H0251: in the integrity H8537 of my heart H3824 and innocency H5356 of my hands H3709 have I done H6213 (8804) this.
020:006 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto him in a dream H2472, Yea H1571, I know H3045 (8804) that thou didst H6213 (8804) this in the integrity H8537 of thy heart H3824; for I also withheld H2820 (8799) thee from sinning H2398 (8800) against me: therefore suffered H5414 (8804) I thee not to touch H5060 (8800) her.
020:007 Now therefore restore H7725 (8685) the man H0376 [his] wife H0802; for he [is] a prophet H5030, and he shall pray H6419 (8691) for thee H1157, and thou shalt live H2421 (8798): and if thou restore H7725 (8688) [her] not, know H3045 (8798) thou that thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799), thou, and all that [are] thine.
020:008 Therefore Abimelech H0040 rose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and called H7121 (8799) all his servants H5650, and told H1696 (8762) all these things H1697 in their ears H0241: and the men H0582 were sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8799).
020:009 Then Abimelech H0040 called H7121 (8799) Abraham H0085, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, What hast thou done H6213 (8804) unto us? and what have I offended H2398 (8804) thee, that thou hast brought H0935 (8689) on me and on my kingdom H4467 a great H1419 sin H2401? thou hast done H6213 (8804) deeds H4639 unto me that ought not to be done H6213 (8735).
020:010 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, What H4100 sawest thou H7200 (8804), that thou hast done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697?
020:011 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799), Because I thought H0559 (8804), Surely H7535 the fear H3374 of God H0430 [is] not in this place H4725; and they will slay me H2026 (8804) for my wife’s H0802 sake H1697.
020:012 And yet indeed H0546 [she is] my sister H0269; she [is] the daughter H1323 of my father H0001, but not the daughter H1323 of my mother H0517; and she became my wife H0802.
020:013 And it came to pass, when God H0430 caused me to wander H8582 (8689) from my father’s H0001 house H1004, that I said H0559 (8799) unto her, This [is] thy kindness H2617 which thou shalt shew H6213 (8799) unto me; at every place H4725 whither we shall come H0935 (8799), say H0559 (8798) of me, He [is] my brother H0251.
020:014 And Abimelech H0040 took H3947 (8799) sheep H6629, and oxen H1241, and menservants H5650, and womenservants H8198, and gave H5414 (8799) [them] unto Abraham H0085, and restored H7725 (8686) him Sarah H8283 his wife H0802.
020:015 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799), Behold, my land H0776 [is] before thee H6440: dwell H3427 (8798) where it pleaseth H2896 H5869 thee.
020:016 And unto Sarah H8283 he said H0559 (8804), Behold, I have given H5414 (8804) thy brother H0251 a thousand H0505 [pieces] of silver H3701: behold, he [is] to thee a covering H3682 of the eyes H5869, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved H3198 (8737).
020:017 So Abraham H0085 prayed H6419 (8691) unto God H0430: and God H0430 healed H7495 (8799) Abimelech H0040, and his wife H0802, and his maidservants H0519; and they bare H3205 (8799) [children].
020:018 For the LORD H3068 had fast H6113 (8800) closed up H6113 (8804) all the wombs H7358 of the house H1004 of Abimelech H0040, because H1697 of Sarah H8283 Abraham’s H0085 wife H0802.
021:001 ¶ And the LORD H3068 visited H6485 (8804) Sarah H8283 as he had said H0559 (8804), and the LORD H3068 did H6213 (8799) unto Sarah H8283 as he had spoken H1696 (8765).
021:002 For Sarah H8283 conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) Abraham H0085 a son H1121 in his old age H2208, at the set time H4150 of which God H0430 had spoken H1696 (8765) to him.
021:003 And Abraham H0085 called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of his son H1121 that was born H3205 (8737) unto him, whom Sarah H8283 bare H3205 (8804) to him, Isaac H3327.
021:004 And Abraham H0085 circumcised H4135 (8799) his son H1121 Isaac H3327 being eight H8083 days H3117 old H1121, as God H0430 had commanded H6680 (8765) him.
021:005 And Abraham H0085 was an hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121, when his son H1121 Isaac H3327 was born H3205 (8736) unto him.
021:006 And Sarah H8283 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath made H6213 (8804) me to laugh H6712, [so that] all that hear H8085 (8802) will laugh H6711 (8799) with me.
021:007 And she said H0559 (8799), Who would have said H4448 (8765) unto Abraham H0085, that Sarah H8283 should have given children H1121 suck H3243 (8689)? for I have born H3205 (8804) [him] a son H1121 in his old age H2208.
021:008 And the child H3206 grew H1431 (8799), and was weaned H1580 (8735): and Abraham H0085 made H6213 (8799) a great H1419 feast H4960 the [same] day H3117 that Isaac H3327 was weaned H1580 (8736).
021:009 And Sarah H8283 saw H7200 (8799) the son H1121 of Hagar H1904 the Egyptian H4713, which she had born H3205 (8804) unto Abraham H0085, mocking H6711 (8764).
021:010 Wherefore she said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, Cast out H1644 (8761) this bondwoman H0519 and her son H1121: for the son H1121 of this bondwoman H0519 shall not be heir H3423 (8799) with my son H1121, [even] with Isaac H3327.
021:011 And the thing H1697 was very H3966 grievous H3415 (8799) in Abraham’s H0085 sight H5869 because H0182 of his son H1121.
021:012 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, Let it not be grievous H3415 (8799) in thy sight H5869 because of the lad H5288, and because of thy bondwoman H0519; in all that Sarah H8283 hath said H0559 (8799) unto thee, hearken H8085 (8798) unto her voice H6963; for in Isaac H3327 shall thy seed H2233 be called H7121 (8735).
021:013 And also of the son H1121 of the bondwoman H0519 will I make H7760 (8799) a nation H1471, because he [is] thy seed H2233.
021:014 And Abraham H0085 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and took H3947 (8799) bread H3899, and a bottle H2573 of water H4325, and gave H5414 (8799) [it] unto Hagar H1904, putting H7760 (8804) [it] on her shoulder H7926, and the child H3206, and sent her away H7971 (8762): and she departed H3212 (8799), and wandered H8582 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 of Beersheba H0884.
021:015 And the water H4325 was spent H3615 (8799) in H4480 the bottle H2573, and she cast H7993 (8686) the child H3206 under one H0259 of the shrubs H7880.
021:016 And she went H3212 (8799), and sat her down H3427 (8799) over against H5048 [him] a good way off H7368 (8687), as it were a bowshot H2909 (8764) H7198: for she said H0559 (8804), Let me not see H7200 (8799) the death H4194 of the child H3206. And she sat H3427 (8799) over against [him], and lift up H5375 (8799) her voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
021:017 And God H0430 heard H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the lad H5288; and the angel H4397 of God H0430 called H7121 (8799) to Hagar H1904 out of heaven H8064, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar H1904? fear H3372 (8799) not; for God H0430 hath heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the lad H5288 where he [is].
021:018 Arise H6965 (8798), lift up H5375 (8798) the lad H5288, and hold H2388 (8685) him in thine hand H3027; for I will make H7760 (8799) him a great H1419 nation H1471.
021:019 And God H0430 opened H6491 (8799) her eyes H5869, and she saw H7200 (8799) a well H0875 of water H4325; and she went H3212 (8799), and filled H4390 (8762) the bottle H2573 with water H4325, and gave H8248 the lad H5288 drink H8248 (8686).
021:020 And God H0430 was with the lad H5288; and he grew H1431 (8799), and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the wilderness H4057, and became an archer H7235 (8802) H7199.
021:021 And he dwelt H3427 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290: and his mother H0517 took H3947 (8799) him a wife H0802 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
021:022 And it came to pass at that time H6256, that Abimelech H0040 and Phichol H6369 the chief captain H8269 of his host H6635 spake H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, saying H0559 (8800), God H0430 [is] with thee in all that thou doest H6213 (8802):
021:023 Now therefore swear H7650 (8734) unto me here H2008 by God H0430 that thou wilt not deal falsely H8266 (8799) with me, nor with my son H5209, nor with my son’s son H5220: [but] according to the kindness H2617 that I have done H6213 (8804) unto thee, thou shalt do H6213 (8799) unto me, and to the land H0776 wherein thou hast sojourned H1481 (8804).
021:024 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799), I will swear H7650 (8735).
021:025 And Abraham H0085 reproved H3198 (8689) Abimelech H0040 because H0182 of a well H0875 of water H4325, which Abimelech’s H0040 servants H5650 had violently taken away H1497 (8804).
021:026 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799), I wot H3045 (8804) not who hath done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697: neither H3808 didst thou tell H5046 (8689) me, neither H3808 yet heard H8085 (8804) I [of it], but H1115 to day H3117.
021:027 And Abraham H0085 took H3947 (8799) sheep H6629 and oxen H1241, and gave H5414 (8799) them unto Abimelech H0040; and both of them H8147 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285.
021:028 And Abraham H0085 set H5324 (8686) seven H7651 ewe lambs H3535 of the flock H6629 by themselves.
021:029 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085, What H2008 [mean] these seven H7651 ewe lambs H3535 which thou hast set H5324 (8689) by themselves?
021:030 And he said H0559 (8799), For [these] seven H7651 ewe lambs H3535 shalt thou take H3947 (8799) of my hand H3027, that H5668 they may be a witness H5713 unto me, that I have digged H2658 (8804) this well H0875.
021:031 Wherefore he called H7121 (8804) that place H4725 Beersheba H0884; because there they sware H7650 (8738) both of them H8147.
021:032 Thus they made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 at Beersheba H0884: then Abimelech H0040 rose up H6965 (8799), and Phichol H6369 the chief captain H8269 of his host H6635, and they returned H7725 (8799) into the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430.
021:033 And [Abraham] planted H5193 (8799) a grove H0815 in Beersheba H0884, and called H7121 (8799) there on the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, the everlasting H5769 God H0410.
021:034 And Abraham H0085 sojourned H1481 (8799) in the Philistines H6430 ’ land H0776 many H7227 days H3117.
022:001 ¶ And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, that God H0430 did tempt H5254 (8765) Abraham H0085, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Abraham H0085: and he said H0559 (8799), Behold, [here] I [am].
022:002 And he said H0559 (8799), Take now H3947 (8798) thy son H1121, thine only H3173 [son] Isaac H3327, whom thou lovest H0157 (8804), and get thee H3212 (8798) into the land H0776 of Moriah H4179; and offer him H5927 (8685) there for a burnt offering H5930 upon one H0259 of the mountains H2022 which I will tell H0559 (8799) thee of.
022:003 And Abraham H0085 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and saddled H2280 (8799) his ass H2543, and took H3947 (8799) two H8147 of his young men H5288 with him, and Isaac H3327 his son H1121, and clave H1234 (8762) the wood H6086 for the burnt offering H5930, and rose up H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) unto the place H4725 of which God H0430 had told H0559 (8804) him.
022:004 Then on the third H7992 day H3117 Abraham H0085 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) the place H4725 afar off H7350.
022:005 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799) unto his young men H5288, Abide H3427 (8798) ye here with the ass H2543; and I and the lad H5288 will go H3212 (8799) yonder H3541 and worship H7812 (8691), and come again H7725 (8799) to you.
022:006 And Abraham H0085 took H3947 (8799) the wood H6086 of the burnt offering H5930, and laid H7760 (8799) [it] upon Isaac H3327 his son H1121; and he took H3947 (8799) the fire H0784 in his hand H3027, and a knife H3979; and they went H3212 (8799) both H8147 of them together H3162.
022:007 And Isaac H3327 spake H0559 (8799) unto Abraham H0085 his father H0001, and said H0559 (8799), My father H0001: and he said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I, my son H1121. And he said H0559 (8799), Behold the fire H0784 and the wood H6086: but where [is] the lamb H7716 for a burnt offering H5930?
022:008 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799), My son H1121, God H0430 will provide H7200 (8799) himself a lamb H7716 for a burnt offering H5930: so they went H3212 (8799) both of them H8147 together H3162.
022:009 And they came H0935 (8799) to the place H4725 which God H0430 had told H0559 (8804) him of; and Abraham H0085 built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 there, and laid H6186 the wood H6086 in order H6186 (8799), and bound H6123 (8799) Isaac H3327 his son H1121, and laid H7760 (8799) him on the altar H4196 upon H4605 the wood H6086.
022:010 And Abraham H0085 stretched forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and took H3947 (8799) the knife H3979 to slay H7819 (8800) his son H1121.
022:011 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8799) unto him out of heaven H8064, and said H0559 (8799), Abraham H0085, Abraham H0085: and he said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
022:012 And he said H0559 (8799), Lay H7971 (8799) not thine hand H3027 upon H0413 the lad H5288, neither do thou H6213 (8799) any thing H3972 unto him: for now H6258 I know H3045 (8804) that thou fearest H3373 God H0430, seeing thou hast not H3808 withheld H2820 (8804) thy son H1121, thine only H3173 [son] from me.
022:013 And Abraham H0085 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and looked H7200 (8799), and behold behind H0310 [him] a ram H0352 caught H0270 (8737) in a thicket H5442 by his horns H7161: and Abraham H0085 went H3212 (8799) and took H3947 (8799) the ram H0352, and offered him up H5927 (8686) for a burnt offering H5930 in the stead H8478 of his son H1121.
022:014 And Abraham H0085 called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Jehovahjireh H3070: as H0834 it is said H0559 (8735) [to] this day H3117, In the mount H2022 of the LORD H3068 it shall be seen H7200 (8735).
022:015 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 called H7121 (8799) unto Abraham H0085 out of heaven H8064 the second time H8145,
022:016 And said H0559 (8799), By myself have I sworn H7650 (8738), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, for because H3282 H0834 thou hast done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697, and hast not H3808 withheld H2820 (8804) thy son H1121, thine only H3173 [son]:
022:017 That in blessing H1288 (8763) I will bless H1288 (8762) thee, and in multiplying H7235 (8687) I will multiply H7235 (8686) thy seed H2233 as the stars H3556 of the heaven H8064, and as the sand H2344 which [is] upon the sea H3220 shore H8193; and thy seed H2233 shall possess H3423 (8799) the gate H8179 of his enemies H0341 (8802);
022:018 And in thy seed H2233 shall all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776 be blessed H1288 (8694); because H0834 H6118 thou hast obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963.
022:019 So Abraham H0085 returned H7725 (8799) unto his young men H5288, and they rose up H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799) together H3162 to Beersheba H0884; and Abraham H0085 dwelt H3427 (8799) at Beersheba H0884.
022:020 And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, that it was told H5046 (8714) Abraham H0085, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, Milcah H4435, she hath also born H3205 (8804) children H1121 unto thy brother H0251 Nahor H5152;
022:021 Huz H5780 his firstborn H1060, and Buz H0938 his brother H0251, and Kemuel H7055 the father H0001 of Aram H0758,
022:022 And Chesed H3777, and Hazo H2375, and Pildash H6394, and Jidlaph H3044, and Bethuel H1328.
022:023 And Bethuel H1328 begat H3205 (8804) Rebekah H7259: these eight H8083 Milcah H4435 did bear H3205 (8804) to Nahor H5152, Abraham’s H0085 brother H0251.
022:024 And his concubine H6370, whose name H8034 [was] Reumah H7208, she bare H3205 (8799) also Tebah H2875, and Gaham H1514, and Thahash H8477, and Maachah H4601.
023:001 ¶ And Sarah H8283 was an hundred H3967 H8141 and seven H7651 H8141 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H2416: [these were] the years H8141 of the life H2416 of Sarah H8283.
023:002 And Sarah H8283 died H4191 (8799) in Kirjatharba H7153; the same [is] Hebron H2275 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667: and Abraham H0085 came H0935 (8799) to mourn H5594 (8800) for Sarah H8283, and to weep H1058 (8800) for her.
023:003 And Abraham H0085 stood up H6965 (8799) from before H6440 his dead H4191 (8801), and spake H1696 (8762) unto the sons H1121 of Heth H2845, saying H0559 (8800),
023:004 I [am] a stranger H1616 and a sojourner H8453 with you: give H5414 (8798) me a possession H0272 of a buryingplace H6913 with you, that I may bury H6912 (8799) my dead H4191 (8801) out of my sight H6440.
023:005 And the children H1121 of Heth H2845 answered H6030 (8799) Abraham H0085, saying H0559 (8800) unto him,
023:006 Hear us H8085 (8798), my lord H0113: thou [art] a mighty H0430 prince H5387 among us H8432: in the choice H4005 of our sepulchres H6913 bury H6912 (8798) thy dead H4191 (8801); none H3808 H0376 of us shall withhold H3607 (8799) from thee his sepulchre H6913, but that thou mayest bury H6912 (8800) thy dead H4191 (8801).
023:007 And Abraham H0085 stood up H6965 (8799), and bowed H7812 (8691) himself to the people H5971 of the land H0776, [even] to the children H1121 of Heth H2845.
023:008 And he communed H1696 (8762) with them, saying H0559 (8800), If it be H3426 your mind H5315 that I should bury H6912 (8800) my dead H4191 (8801) out of my sight H6440; hear H8085 (8798) me, and intreat H6293 (8798) for me to Ephron H6085 the son H1121 of Zohar H6714,
023:009 That he may give H5414 (8799) me the cave H4631 of Machpelah H4375, which he hath, which [is] in the end H7097 of his field H7704; for as much H4392 money H3701 as it is worth H4392 he shall give it H5414 (8799) me for a possession H0272 of a buryingplace H6913 amongst you H8432.
023:010 And Ephron H6085 dwelt H3427 (8802) among H8432 the children H1121 of Heth H2845: and Ephron H6085 the Hittite H2850 answered H6030 (8799) Abraham H0085 in the audience H0241 of the children H1121 of Heth H2845, [even] of all that went in H0935 (8802) at the gate H8179 of his city H5892, saying H0559 (8800),
023:011 Nay H3808, my lord H0113, hear me H8085 (8798): the field H7704 give I H5414 (8804) thee, and the cave H4631 that [is] therein, I give it H5414 (8804) thee; in the presence H5869 of the sons H1121 of my people H5971 give H5414 (8804) I it thee: bury H6912 (8798) thy dead H4191 (8801).
023:012 And Abraham H0085 bowed down H7812 (8691) himself before H6440 the people H5971 of the land H0776.
023:013 And he spake H1696 (8762) unto Ephron H6085 in the audience H0241 of the people H5971 of the land H0776, saying H0559 (8800), But if thou [wilt give it], I pray thee H3863, hear H8085 (8798) me: I will give H5414 (8804) thee money H3701 for the field H7704; take H3947 (8798) [it] of me, and I will bury H6912 (8799) my dead H4191 (8801) there.
023:014 And Ephron H6085 answered H6030 (8799) Abraham H0085, saying H0559 (8800) unto him,
023:015 My lord H0113, hearken H8085 (8798) unto me: the land H0776 [is worth] four H0702 hundred H3967 shekels H8255 of silver H3701; what [is] that betwixt H0996 me and thee? bury H6912 (8798) therefore thy dead H4191 (8801).
023:016 And Abraham H0085 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto Ephron H6085; and Abraham H0085 weighed H8254 (8799) to Ephron H6085 the silver H3701, which he had named H1696 (8765) in the audience H0241 of the sons H1121 of Heth H2845, four H0702 hundred H3967 shekels H8255 of silver H3701, current H5674 (8802) [money] with the merchant H5503 (8802).
023:017 And the field H7704 of Ephron H6085, which [was] in Machpelah H4375, which [was] before H6440 Mamre H4471, the field H7704, and the cave H4631 which [was] therein, and all the trees H6086 that [were] in the field H7704, that [were] in all the borders H1366 round about H5439, were made sure H6965 (8799)
023:018 Unto Abraham H0085 for a possession H4736 in the presence H5869 of the children H1121 of Heth H2845, before all that went in H0935 (8802) at the gate H8179 of his city H5892.
023:019 And after H0310 this H3651, Abraham H0085 buried H6912 (8804) Sarah H8283 his wife H0802 in the cave H4631 of the field H7704 of Machpelah H4375 before H6440 Mamre H4471: the same [is] Hebron H2275 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
023:020 And the field H7704, and the cave H4631 that [is] therein, were made sure H6965 (8799) unto Abraham H0085 for a possession H0272 of a buryingplace H6913 by the sons H1121 of Heth H2845.
024:001 ¶ And Abraham H0085 was old H2204 (8804), [and] well stricken H0935 (8804) in age H3117: and the LORD H3068 had blessed H1288 (8765) Abraham H0085 in all things.
024:002 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799) unto his eldest H2205 servant H5650 of his house H1004, that ruled over H4910 (8802) all that he had, Put H7760 (8798), I pray thee, thy hand H3027 under my thigh H3409:
024:003 And I will make thee swear H7650 (8686) by the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of heaven H8064, and the God H0430 of the earth H0776, that thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 unto my son H1121 of the daughters H1323 of the Canaanites H3669, among H7130 whom I dwell H3427 (8802):
024:004 But thou shalt go H3212 (8799) unto my country H0776, and to my kindred H4138, and take H3947 (8804) a wife H0802 unto my son H1121 Isaac H3327.
024:005 And the servant H5650 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Peradventure the woman H0802 will not be willing H0014 (8799) to follow H3212 (8800) me H0310 unto this land H0776: must I needs bring H7725 (8687) thy son H1121 again H7725 (8686) unto the land H0776 from whence thou camest H3318 (8804)?
024:006 And Abraham H0085 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Beware H8104 (8734) thou that thou bring H7725 not H6435 my son H1121 thither again H7725 (8686).
024:007 The LORD H3068 God H0430 of heaven H8064, which took me H3947 (8804) from my father’s H0001 house H1004, and from the land H0776 of my kindred H4138, and which spake H1696 (8765) unto me, and that sware H7650 (8738) unto me, saying H0559 (8800), Unto thy seed H2233 will I give H5414 (8799) this land H0776; he shall send H7971 (8799) his angel H4397 before thee H6440, and thou shalt take H3947 (8804) a wife H0802 unto my son H1121 from thence.
024:008 And if the woman H0802 will not be willing H0014 (8799) to follow H3212 (8800) thee H0310, then thou shalt be clear H5352 (8738) from this my oath H7621: only bring H7725 not my son H1121 thither again H7725 (8686).
024:009 And the servant H5650 put H7760 (8799) his hand H3027 under the thigh H3409 of Abraham H0085 his master H0113, and sware H7650 (8735) to him concerning H5921 that H2088 matter H1697.
024:010 And the servant H5650 took H3947 (8799) ten H6235 camels H1581 of the camels H1581 of his master H0113, and departed H3212 (8799); for all the goods H2898 of his master H0113 [were] in his hand H3027: and he arose H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Mesopotamia H0763, unto the city H5892 of Nahor H5152.
024:011 And he made H1288 his camels H1581 to kneel down H1288 (8686) without H2351 the city H5892 by H0413 a well H0875 of water H4325 at the time H6256 of the evening H6153, [even] the time H6256 that women go out H3318 (8800) to draw H7579 (8802) [water].
024:012 And he said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of my master H0113 Abraham H0085, I pray thee, send me H6440 good speed H7136 (8685) this day H3117, and shew H6213 (8798) kindness H2617 unto H5973 my master H0113 Abraham H0085.
024:013 Behold, I stand H5324 (8737) [here] by the well H5869 of water H4325; and the daughters H1323 of the men H0582 of the city H5892 come out H3318 (8802) to draw H7579 (8800) water H4325:
024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel H5291 to whom I shall say H0559 (8799), Let down H5186 (8685) thy pitcher H3537, I pray thee, that I may drink H8354 (8799); and she shall say H0559 (8804), Drink H8354 (8798), and I will give H8248 thy camels H1581 drink H8248 (8686) also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed H3198 (8689) for thy servant H5650 Isaac H3327; and thereby shall I know H3045 (8799) that thou hast shewed H6213 (8804) kindness H2617 unto my master H0113.
024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done H3615 (8765) speaking H1696 (8763), that, behold, Rebekah H7259 came out H3318 (8802), who H0834 was born H3205 (8795) to Bethuel H1328, son H1121 of Milcah H4435, the wife H0802 of Nahor H5152, Abraham’s H0085 brother H0251, with her pitcher H3537 upon her shoulder H7926.
024:016 And the damsel H5291 [was] very H3966 fair H2896 to look upon H4758, a virgin H1330, neither had any man H0376 known H3045 (8804) her: and she went down H3381 (8799) to the well H5869, and filled H4390 (8762) her pitcher H3537, and came up H5927 (8799).
024:017 And the servant H5650 ran H7323 (8799) to meet her H7125 (8800), and said H0559 (8799), Let me, I pray thee, drink H1572 (8685) a little H4592 water H4325 of thy pitcher H3537.
024:018 And she said H0559 (8799), Drink H8354 (8798), my lord H0113: and she hasted H4116 (8762), and let down H3381 (8686) her pitcher H3537 upon her hand H3027, and gave him drink H8248 (8686).
024:019 And when she had done H3615 (8762) giving him drink H8248 (8687), she said H0559 (8799), I will draw H7579 (8799) [water] for thy camels H1581 also, until they have done H3615 (8765) drinking H8354 (8800).
024:020 And she hasted H4116 (8762), and emptied H6168 (8762) her pitcher H3537 into the trough H8268, and ran H7323 (8799) again unto the well H0875 to draw H7579 (8800) [water], and drew H7579 (8799) for all his camels H1581.
024:021 And the man H0376 wondering H7583 (8693) at her held his peace H2790 (8688), to wit H3045 (8800) whether the LORD H3068 had made H6743 his journey H1870 prosperous H6743 (8689) or H0518 not.
024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels H1581 had done H3615 (8765) drinking H8354 (8800), that the man H0376 took H3947 (8799) a golden H2091 earring H5141 of half a shekel H1235 weight H4948, and two H8147 bracelets H6781 for her hands H3027 of ten H6235 [shekels] weight H4948 of gold H2091;
024:023 And said H0559 (8799), Whose H4310 daughter H1323 [art] thou H0859? tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee: is there H3426 room H4725 [in] thy father’s H0001 house H1004 for us to lodge in H3885 (8800)?
024:024 And she said H0559 (8799) unto him, I [am] the daughter H1323 of Bethuel H1328 the son H1121 of Milcah H4435, which she bare H3205 (8804) unto Nahor H5152.
024:025 She said H0559 (8799) moreover unto him, We have both H1571 straw H8401 and provender H4554 enough H7227, and H1571 room H4725 to lodge in H3885 (8800).
024:026 And the man H0376 bowed down his head H6915 (8799), and worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068.
024:027 And he said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of my master H0113 Abraham H0085, who hath not left destitute H5800 (8804) H5973 my master H0113 of his mercy H2617 and his truth H0571: I [being] in the way H1870, the LORD H3068 led me H5148 (8804) to the house H1004 of my master’s H0113 brethren H0251.
024:028 And the damsel H5291 ran H7323 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) [them of] her mother’s H0517 house H1004 these things H1697.
024:029 And Rebekah H7259 had a brother H0251, and his name H8034 [was] Laban H3837: and Laban H3837 ran H7323 (8799) out H2351 unto the man H0376, unto the well H5869.
024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw H7200 (8800) the earring H5141 and bracelets H6781 upon his sister’s H0269 hands H3027, and when he heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of Rebekah H7259 his sister H0269, saying H0559 (8800), Thus H3541 spake H1696 (8765) the man H0376 unto me; that he came H0935 (8799) unto the man H0376; and, behold, he stood H5975 (8802) by H5921 the camels H1581 at the well H5869.
024:031 And he said H0559 (8799), Come in H0935 (8798), thou blessed H1288 (8803) of the LORD H3068; wherefore standest H5975 (8799) thou without H2351? for I have prepared H6437 (8765) the house H1004, and room H4725 for the camels H1581.
024:032 And the man H0376 came H0935 (8799) into the house H1004: and he ungirded H6605 (8762) his camels H1581, and gave H5414 (8799) straw H8401 and provender H4554 for the camels H1581, and water H4325 to wash H7364 (8800) his feet H7272, and the men’s H0582 feet H7272 that [were] with him.
024:033 And there was set H7760 (8714) (8675) H3455 (8799) [meat] before him H6440 to eat H0398 (8800): but he said H0559 (8799), I will not eat H0398 (8799), until I have told H1696 (8765) mine errand H1697. And he said H0559 (8799), Speak on H1696 (8761).
024:034 And he said H0559 (8799), I [am] Abraham’s H0085 servant H5650.
024:035 And the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765) my master H0113 greatly H3966; and he is become great H1431 (8799): and he hath given H5414 (8799) him flocks H6629, and herds H1241, and silver H3701, and gold H2091, and menservants H5650, and maidservants H8198, and camels H1581, and asses H2543.
024:036 And Sarah H8283 my master’s H0113 wife H0802 bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121 to my master H0113 when H0310 she was old H2209: and unto him hath he given H5414 (8799) all that he hath.
024:037 And my master H0113 made me swear H7650 (8686), saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 to my son H1121 of the daughters H1323 of the Canaanites H3669, in whose land H0776 I dwell H3427 (8802):
024:038 But H0518 thou shalt go H3212 (8799) unto my father’s H0001 house H1004, and to my kindred H4940, and take H3947 (8804) a wife H0802 unto my son H1121.
024:039 And I said H0559 (8799) unto my master H0113, Peradventure the woman H0802 will not follow H3212 (8799) H0310 me.
024:040 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, The LORD H3068, before H6440 whom I walk H1980 (8694), will send H7971 (8799) his angel H4397 with thee, and prosper H6743 (8689) thy way H1870; and thou shalt take H3947 (8804) a wife H0802 for my son H1121 of my kindred H4940, and of my father’s H0001 house H1004:
024:041 Then shalt thou be clear H5352 (8735) from [this] my oath H0423, when thou comest H0935 (8799) to my kindred H4940; and if they give H5414 (8799) not thee [one], thou shalt be clear H5355 from my oath H0423.
024:042 And I came H0935 (8799) this day H3117 unto the well H5869, and said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of my master H0113 Abraham H0085, if now thou do H3426 prosper H6743 (8688) my way H1870 which I go H1980 (8802):
024:043 Behold, I stand H5324 (8737) by the well H5869 of water H4325; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin H5959 cometh forth H3318 (8802) to draw H7579 (8800) [water], and I say H0559 (8804) to her, Give me H8248, I pray thee, a little H4592 water H4325 of thy pitcher H3537 to drink H8248 (8685);
024:044 And she say H0559 (8804) to me, Both drink H8354 (8798) thou, and I will also draw H7579 (8799) for thy camels H1581: [let] the same [be] the woman H0802 whom the LORD H3068 hath appointed out H3198 (8689) for my master’s H0113 son H1121.
024:045 And before I had done H3615 (8762) speaking H1696 (8763) in mine heart H3820, behold, Rebekah H7259 came forth H3318 (8802) with her pitcher H3537 on her shoulder H7926; and she went down H3381 (8799) unto the well H5869, and drew H7579 (8799) [water]: and I said H0559 (8799) unto her, Let me drink H8248 (8685), I pray thee.
024:046 And she made haste H4116 (8762), and let down H3381 (8686) her pitcher H3537 from her [shoulder], and said H0559 (8799), Drink H8354 (8798), and I will give H8248 thy camels H1581 drink H8248 (8686) also: so I drank H8354 (8799), and she made H8248 the camels H1581 drink H8248 (8689) also.
024:047 And I asked H7592 (8799) her, and said H0559 (8799), Whose daughter H1323 [art] thou? And she said H0559 (8799), The daughter H1323 of Bethuel H1328, Nahor’s H5152 son H1121, whom Milcah H4435 bare H3205 (8804) unto him: and I put H7760 (8799) the earring H5141 upon her face H0639, and the bracelets H6781 upon her hands H3027.
024:048 And I bowed down my head H6915 (8799), and worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068, and blessed H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of my master H0113 Abraham H0085, which had led me H5148 (8689) in the right H0571 way H1870 to take H3947 (8800) my master’s H0113 brother’s H0251 daughter H1323 unto his son H1121.
024:049 And now if ye will H3426 deal H6213 (8802) kindly H2617 and truly H0571 with my master H0113, tell H5046 (8685) me: and if not, tell H5046 (8685) me; that I may turn H6437 (8799) to the right hand H3225, or H0176 to the left H8040.
024:050 Then Laban H3837 and Bethuel H1328 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), The thing H1697 proceedeth H3318 (8804) from the LORD H3068: we cannot H3201 (8799) speak H1696 (8763) unto thee bad H7451 or H0176 good H2896.
024:051 Behold, Rebekah H7259 [is] before thee H6440, take H3947 (8798) [her], and go H3212 (8798), and let her be thy master’s H0113 son’s H1121 wife H0802, as the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765).
024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s H0085 servant H5650 heard H8085 (8804) their words H1697, he worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068, [bowing himself] to the earth H0776.
024:053 And the servant H5650 brought forth H3318 (8686) jewels H3627 of silver H3701, and jewels H3627 of gold H2091, and raiment H0899, and gave H5414 (8799) [them] to Rebekah H7259: he gave H5414 (8804) also to her brother H0251 and to her mother H0517 precious things H4030.
024:054 And they did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), he and the men H0582 that [were] with him, and tarried all night H3885 (8799); and they rose up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, and he said H0559 (8799), Send me away H7971 (8761) unto my master H0113.
024:055 And her brother H0251 and her mother H0517 said H0559 (8799), Let the damsel H5291 abide H3427 (8799) with us [a few] days H3117, at the least H0176 ten H6218; after H0310 that she shall go H3212 (8799).
024:056 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hinder me H0309 (8762) not, seeing the LORD H3068 hath prospered H6743 (8689) my way H1870; send me away H7971 (8761) that I may go H3212 (8799) to my master H0113.
024:057 And they said H0559 (8799), We will call H7121 (8799) the damsel H5291, and enquire H7592 (8799) at her mouth H6310.
024:058 And they called H7121 (8799) Rebekah H7259, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, Wilt thou go H3212 (8799) with this man H0376? And she said H0559 (8799), I will go H3212 (8799).
024:059 And they sent away H7971 (8762) Rebekah H7259 their sister H0269, and her nurse H3243 (8688), and Abraham’s H0085 servant H5650, and his men H0582.
024:060 And they blessed H1288 (8762) Rebekah H7259, and said H0559 (8799) unto her, Thou H0859 [art] our sister H0269, be thou H1961 (8798) [the mother] of thousands H0505 of millions H7233, and let thy seed H2233 possess H3423 (8799) the gate H8179 of those which hate H8130 (8802) them.
024:061 And Rebekah H7259 arose H6965 (8799), and her damsels H5291, and they rode H7392 (8799) upon the camels H1581, and followed H3212 (8799) H0310 the man H0376: and the servant H5650 took H3947 (8799) Rebekah H7259, and went his way H3212 (8799).
024:062 And Isaac H3327 came H0935 (8804) from the way H0935 (8800) of the well Lahairoi H0883; for he dwelt H3427 (8802) in the south H5045 country H0776.
024:063 And Isaac H3327 went out H3318 (8799) to meditate H7742 (8800) in the field H7704 at H6437 (8800) the eventide H6153: and he lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799), and, behold, the camels H1581 [were] coming H0935 (8802).
024:064 And Rebekah H7259 lifted up H5375 (8799) her eyes H5869, and when she saw H7200 (8799) Isaac H3327, she lighted H5307 (8799) off H5921 the camel H1581.
024:065 For she [had] said H0559 (8799) unto the servant H5650, What H4310 man H0376 [is] this H1976 that walketh H1980 (8802) in the field H7704 to meet us H7125 (8800)? And the servant H5650 [had] said H0559 (8799), It [is] my master H0113: therefore she took H3947 (8799) a vail H6809, and covered herself H3680 (8691).
024:066 And the servant H5650 told H5608 (8762) Isaac H3327 all things H1697 that he had done H6213 (8804).
024:067 And Isaac H3327 brought her H0935 (8686) into his mother H0517 Sarah’s H8283 tent H0168, and took H3947 (8799) Rebekah H7259, and she became his wife H0802; and he loved H0157 (8799) her: and Isaac H3327 was comforted H5162 (8735) after H0310 his mother’s H0517 [death].
025:001 ¶ Then again H3254 (8686) Abraham H0085 took H3947 (8799) a wife H0802, and her name H8034 [was] Keturah H6989.
025:002 And she bare H3205 (8799) him Zimran H2175, and Jokshan H3370, and Medan H4091, and Midian H4080, and Ishbak H3435, and Shuah H7744.
025:003 And Jokshan H3370 begat H3205 (8804) Sheba H7614, and Dedan H1719. And the sons H1121 of Dedan H1719 were Asshurim H0805, and Letushim H3912, and Leummim H3817.
025:004 And the sons H1121 of Midian H4080; Ephah H5891, and Epher H6081, and Hanoch H2585, and Abida H0028, and Eldaah H0420. All these [were] the children H1121 of Keturah H6989.
025:005 And Abraham H0085 gave H5414 (8799) all that he had unto Isaac H3327.
025:006 But unto the sons H1121 of the concubines H6370, which Abraham H0085 had, Abraham H0085 gave H5414 (8804) gifts H4979, and sent them away H7971 (8762) from Isaac H3327 his son H1121, while he yet lived H2416, eastward H6924, unto the east H6924 country H0776.
025:007 And these [are] the days H3117 of the years H8141 of Abraham’s H0085 life H2416 which he lived H2425 (8804), an hundred H3967 H8141 threescore and fifteen H7657 H8141 H2568 years H8141.
025:008 Then Abraham H0085 gave up the ghost H1478 (8799), and died H4191 (8799) in a good H2896 old age H7872, an old man H2205, and full H7649 [of years]; and was gathered H0622 (8735) to his people H5971.
025:009 And his sons H1121 Isaac H3327 and Ishmael H3458 buried H6912 (8799) him in the cave H4631 of Machpelah H4375, in the field H7704 of Ephron H6085 the son H1121 of Zohar H6714 the Hittite H2850, which [is] before H6440 Mamre H4471;
025:010 The field H7704 which Abraham H0085 purchased H7069 (8804) of the sons H1121 of Heth H2845: there was Abraham H0085 buried H6912 (8795), and Sarah H8283 his wife H0802.
025:011 And it came to pass after H0310 the death H4194 of Abraham H0085, that God H0430 blessed H1288 (8762) his son H1121 Isaac H3327; and Isaac H3327 dwelt H3427 (8799) by H5973 the well Lahairoi H0883.
025:012 Now these [are] the generations H8435 of Ishmael H3458, Abraham’s H0085 son H1121, whom Hagar H1904 the Egyptian H4713, Sarah’s H8283 handmaid H8198, bare H3205 (8804) unto Abraham H0085:
025:013 And these [are] the names H8034 of the sons H1121 of Ishmael H3458, by their names H8034, according to their generations H8435: the firstborn H1060 of Ishmael H3458, Nebajoth H5032; and Kedar H6938, and Adbeel H0110, and Mibsam H4017,
025:014 And Mishma H4927, and Dumah H1746, and Massa H4854,
025:015 Hadar H2316, and Tema H8485, Jetur H3195, Naphish H5305, and Kedemah H6929:
025:016 These [are] the sons H1121 of Ishmael H3458, and these [are] their names H8034, by their towns H2691, and by their castles H2918; twelve H8147 H6240 princes H5387 according to their nations H0523.
025:017 And these [are] the years H8141 of the life H2416 of Ishmael H3458, an hundred H3967 H8141 and thirty H7970 H8141 and seven H7651 years H8141: and he gave up the ghost H1478 (8799) and died H4191 (8799); and was gathered H0622 (8735) unto his people H5971.
025:018 And they dwelt H7931 (8799) from Havilah H2341 unto Shur H7793, that [is] before H6440 Egypt H4714, as thou goest H0935 (8800) toward Assyria H0804: [and] he died H5307 (8804) in the presence H6440 of all his brethren H0251.
025:019 And these [are] the generations H8435 of Isaac H3327, Abraham’s H0085 son H1121: Abraham H0085 begat H3205 (8689) Isaac H3327:
025:020 And Isaac H3327 was forty H0705 years H8141 old H1121 when he took H3947 (8800) Rebekah H7259 to wife H0802, the daughter H1323 of Bethuel H1328 the Syrian H0761 of Padanaram H6307, the sister H0269 to Laban H3837 the Syrian H0761.
025:021 And Isaac H3327 intreated H6279 (8799) the LORD H3068 for H5227 his wife H0802, because she [was] barren H6135: and the LORD H3068 was intreated H6279 (8735) of him, and Rebekah H7259 his wife H0802 conceived H2029 (8799).
025:022 And the children H1121 struggled together H7533 (8704) within her H7130; and she said H0559 (8799), If [it be] so, why [am] I thus H2088? And she went H3212 (8799) to enquire H1875 (8800) of the LORD H3068.
025:023 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto her, Two H8147 nations H1471 [are] in thy womb H0990, and two manner H8147 of people H3816 shall be separated H6504 (8735) from thy bowels H4578; and [the one] people H3816 shall be stronger H0553 (8799) than [the other] people H3816; and the elder H7227 shall serve H5647 (8799) the younger H6810.
025:024 And when her days H3117 to be delivered H3205 (8800) were fulfilled H4390 (8799), behold, [there were] twins H8380 in her womb H0990.
025:025 And the first H7223 came out H3318 (8799) red H0132, all over like an hairy H8181 garment H0155; and they called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Esau H6215.
025:026 And after H0310 that came H3318 his brother H0251 out H3318 (8804), and his hand H3027 took hold H0270 (8802) on Esau’s H6215 heel H6119; and his name H8034 was called H7121 (8799) Jacob H3290: and Isaac H3327 [was] threescore H8346 years H8141 old H1121 when she bare H3205 (8800) them.
025:027 And the boys H5288 grew H1431 (8799): and Esau H6215 was a cunning H3045 (8802) hunter H6718, a man H0376 of the field H7704; and Jacob H3290 [was] a plain H8535 man H0376, dwelling H3427 (8802) in tents H0168.
025:028 And Isaac H3327 loved H0157 (8799) Esau H6215, because he did eat H6310 of [his] venison H6718: but Rebekah H7259 loved H0157 (8802) Jacob H3290.
025:029 And Jacob H3290 sod H2102 (8686) pottage H5138: and Esau H6215 came H0935 (8799) from the field H7704, and he [was] faint H5889:
025:030 And Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799) to Jacob H3290, Feed H3938 (8685) me, I pray thee, with H4480 that same H0122 red H0122 [pottage]; for I [am] faint H5889: therefore was his name H8034 called H7121 (8804) Edom H0123.
025:031 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799), Sell H4376 (8798) me this day H3117 thy birthright H1062.
025:032 And Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799), Behold, I [am] at the point H1980 (8802) to die H4191 (8800): and what profit shall this birthright H1062 do to me?
025:033 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799), Swear H7650 (8734) to me this day H3117; and he sware H7650 (8735) unto him: and he sold H4376 (8799) his birthright H1062 unto Jacob H3290.
025:034 Then Jacob H3290 gave H5414 (8804) Esau H6215 bread H3899 and pottage H5138 of lentiles H5742; and he did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and rose up H6965 (8799), and went his way H3212 (8799): thus Esau H6215 despised H0959 (8799) [his] birthright H1062.
026:001 ¶ And there was a famine H7458 in the land H0776, beside H0905 the first H7223 famine H7458 that was in the days H3117 of Abraham H0085. And Isaac H3327 went H3212 (8799) unto Abimelech H0040 king H4428 of the Philistines H6430 unto Gerar H1642.
026:002 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), Go not down H3381 (8799) into Egypt H4714; dwell H7931 (8798) in the land H0776 which I shall tell H0559 (8799) thee of:
026:003 Sojourn H1481 (8798) in this land H0776, and I will be with thee, and will bless H1288 (8762) thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed H2233, I will give H5414 (8799) all these H0411 countries H0776, and I will perform H6965 (8689) the oath H7621 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto Abraham H0085 thy father H0001;
026:004 And I will make H7235 thy seed H2233 to multiply H7235 (8689) as the stars H3556 of heaven H8064, and will give H5414 (8804) unto thy seed H2233 all these H0411 countries H0776; and in thy seed H2233 shall all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776 be blessed H1288 (8694);
026:005 Because H6118 that Abraham H0085 obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963, and kept H8104 (8799) my charge H4931, my commandments H4687, my statutes H2708, and my laws H8451.
026:006 And Isaac H3327 dwelt H3427 (8799) in Gerar H1642:
026:007 And the men H0582 of the place H4725 asked H7592 (8799) [him] of his wife H0802; and he said H0559 (8799), She [is] my sister H0269: for he feared H3372 (8804) to say H0559 (8800), [She is] my wife H0802; lest, [said he], the men H0582 of the place H4725 should kill H2026 (8799) me for Rebekah H7259; because she [was] fair H2896 to look upon H4758.
026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long H0748 (8804) time H3117, that Abimelech H0040 king H4428 of the Philistines H6430 looked out H8259 (8686) at H1157 a window H2474, and saw H7200 (8799), and, behold, Isaac H3327 [was] sporting H6711 (8764) with Rebekah H7259 his wife H0802.
026:009 And Abimelech H0040 called H7121 (8799) Isaac H3327, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, of a surety H0389 she [is] thy wife H0802: and how saidst H0559 (8804) thou, She [is] my sister H0269? And Isaac H3327 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Because I said H0559 (8804), Lest I die H4191 (8799) for her.
026:010 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799), What [is] this thou hast done H6213 (8804) unto us? one H0259 of the people H5971 might lightly H4592 have lien H7901 (8804) with thy wife H0802, and thou shouldest have brought H0935 (8689) guiltiness H0817 upon us.
026:011 And Abimelech H0040 charged H6680 (8762) all [his] people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), He that toucheth H5060 (8802) this man H0376 or his wife H0802 shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
026:012 Then Isaac H3327 sowed H2232 (8799) in that land H0776, and received H4672 (8799) in the same year H8141 an hundredfold H3967 H8180: and the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8762) him.
026:013 And the man H0376 waxed great H1431 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) forward H1980 (8800), and grew H1432 until he became H1431 very H3966 great H1431 (8804):
026:014 For he had possession H4735 of flocks H6629, and possession H4735 of herds H1241, and great store H7227 of servants H5657: and the Philistines H6430 envied H7065 (8762) him.
026:015 For all the wells H0875 which his father’s H0001 servants H5650 had digged H2658 (8804) in the days H3117 of Abraham H0085 his father H0001, the Philistines H6430 had stopped H5640 (8765) them, and filled H4390 (8762) them with earth H6083.
026:016 And Abimelech H0040 said H0559 (8799) unto Isaac H3327, Go H3212 (8798) from us; for thou art much H3966 mightier H6105 (8804) than we.
026:017 And Isaac H3327 departed H3212 (8799) thence, and pitched his tent H2583 (8799) in the valley H5158 of Gerar H1642, and dwelt H3427 (8799) there H8033.
026:018 And Isaac H3327 digged H2658 (8799) again H7725 (8799) the wells H0875 of water H4325, which they had digged H2658 (8804) in the days H3117 of Abraham H0085 his father H0001; for the Philistines H6430 had stopped H5640 (8762) them after H0310 the death H4194 of Abraham H0085: and he called H7121 (8799) their names H8034 after the names H8034 by which H0834 his father H0001 had called H7121 (8804) them.
026:019 And Isaac’s H3327 servants H5650 digged H2658 (8799) in the valley H5158, and found H4672 (8799) there a well H0875 of springing H2416 water H4325.
026:020 And the herdmen H7462 (8802) of Gerar H1642 did strive H7378 (8799) with Isaac’s H3327 herdmen H7462 (8802), saying H0559 (8800), The water H4325 [is] ours: and he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the well H0875 Esek H6230; because they strove H6229 (8694) with him.
026:021 And they digged H2658 (8799) another H0312 well H0875, and strove H7378 (8799) for that also: and he called H7121 (8799) the name of it H8034 Sitnah H7856.
026:022 And he removed H6275 (8686) from thence, and digged H2658 (8799) another H0312 well H0875; and for that they strove H7378 (8804) not: and he called H7121 (8799) the name of it H8034 Rehoboth H7344; and he said H0559 (8799), For now H6258 the LORD H3068 hath made room H7337 (8689) for us, and we shall be fruitful H6509 (8804) in the land H0776.
026:023 And he went up H5927 (8799) from thence to Beersheba H0884.
026:024 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto him the same night H3915, and said H0559 (8799), I [am] the God H0430 of Abraham H0085 thy father H0001: fear H3372 (8799) not, for I [am] with H0854 thee, and will bless H1288 (8765) thee, and multiply H7235 (8689) thy seed H2233 for my servant H5650 Abraham’s H0085 sake.
026:025 And he builded H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 there, and called H7121 (8799) upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, and pitched H5186 (8799) his tent H0168 there: and there Isaac’s H3327 servants H5650 digged H3738 (8799) a well H0875.
026:026 Then Abimelech H0040 went H1980 (8804) to him from Gerar H1642, and Ahuzzath H0276 one of his friends H4828, and Phichol H6369 the chief captain H8269 of his army H6635.
026:027 And Isaac H3327 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Wherefore H4069 come H0935 (8804) ye to me, seeing ye hate H8130 (8804) me, and have sent me away H7971 (8762) from you?
026:028 And they said H0559 (8799), We saw H7200 (8804) certainly H7200 (8800) that the LORD H3068 was with thee: and we said H0559 (8799), Let there be now an oath H0423 betwixt H0996 us, [even] betwixt H0996 us and thee, and let us make H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with thee;
026:029 That thou wilt do H6213 (8799) us no hurt H7451, as we have not touched H5060 (8804) thee, and as we have done H6213 (8804) unto thee nothing but H7535 good H2896, and have sent thee away H7971 (8762) in peace H7965: thou [art] now H6258 the blessed H1288 (8803) of the LORD H3068.
026:030 And he made H6213 (8799) them a feast H4960, and they did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799).
026:031 And they rose up betimes H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and sware H7650 (8735) one H0376 to another H0251: and Isaac H3327 sent them away H7971 (8762), and they departed H3212 (8799) from him in peace H7965.
026:032 And it came to pass the same day H3117, that Isaac’s H3327 servants H5650 came H0935 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) him concerning H0182 the well H0875 which they had digged H2658 (8804), and said H0559 (8799) unto him, We have found H4672 (8804) water H4325.
026:033 And he called H7121 (8799) it Shebah H7656: therefore the name H8034 of the city H5892 [is] Beersheba H0884 unto this day H3117.
026:034 And Esau H6215 was forty H0705 years H8141 old H1121 when he took H3947 (8799) to wife H0802 Judith H3067 the daughter H1323 of Beeri H0882 the Hittite H2850, and Bashemath H1315 the daughter H1323 of Elon H0356 the Hittite H2850:
026:035 Which were a grief H4786 of mind H7307 unto Isaac H3327 and to Rebekah H7259.
027:001 ¶ And it came to pass H1961 (8799), that when Isaac H3327 was old H2204 (8804), and his eyes H5869 were dim H3543 (8799), so that he could not see H7200 (8800), he called H7121 (8799) Esau H6215 his eldest H1419 son H1121, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, My son H1121: and he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, [here am] I.
027:002 And he said H0559 (8799), Behold now, I am old H2204 (8804), I know H3045 (8804) not the day H3117 of my death H4194:
027:003 Now therefore take H5375 (8798), I pray thee, thy weapons H3627, thy quiver H8522 and thy bow H7198, and go out H3318 (8798) to the field H7704, and take H6679 (8798) me [some] venison H6718 (8675) H6720;
027:004 And make H6213 (8798) me savoury meat H4303, such as H0834 I love H0157 (8804), and bring H0935 (8685) [it] to me, that I may eat H0398 (8799); that my soul H5315 may bless H1288 (8762) thee before H2962 I die H4191 (8799).
027:005 And Rebekah H7259 heard H8085 (8802) when Isaac H3327 spake H1696 (8763) to Esau H6215 his son H1121. And Esau H6215 went H3212 (8799) to the field H7704 to hunt H6679 (8800) [for] venison H6718, [and] to bring H0935 (8687) [it].
027:006 And Rebekah H7259 spake H0559 (8804) unto Jacob H3290 her son H1121, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, I heard H8085 (8804) thy father H0001 speak H1696 (8764) unto Esau H6215 thy brother H0251, saying H0559 (8800),
027:007 Bring H0935 (8685) me venison H6718, and make H6213 (8798) me savoury meat H4303, that I may eat H0398 (8799), and bless H1288 (8762) thee before H6440 the LORD H3068 before H6440 my death H4194.
027:008 Now therefore, my son H1121, obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963 according to that which H0834 I command H6680 (8764) thee.
027:009 Go H3212 (8798) now to the flock H6629, and fetch H3947 (8798) me from thence two H8147 good H2896 kids H1423 of the goats H5795; and I will make H6213 (8799) them savoury meat H4303 for thy father H0001, such as he loveth H0157 (8804):
027:010 And thou shalt bring H0935 (8689) [it] to thy father H0001, that he may eat H0398 (8804), and that H0834 he may bless H1288 (8762) thee before H6440 his death H4194.
027:011 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) to Rebekah H7259 his mother H0517, Behold, Esau H6215 my brother H0251 [is] a hairy H8163 man H0376, and I [am] a smooth H2509 man H0376:
027:012 My father H0001 peradventure will feel H4959 (8799) me, and I shall seem H5869 to him as a deceiver H8591 (8772); and I shall bring H0935 (8689) a curse H7045 upon me, and not a blessing H1293.
027:013 And his mother H0517 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Upon me [be] thy curse H7045, my son H1121: only obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963, and go H3212 (8798) fetch H3947 (8798) me [them].
027:014 And he went H3212 (8799), and fetched H3947 (8799), and brought H0935 (8686) [them] to his mother H0517: and his mother H0517 made H6213 (8799) savoury meat H4303, such as his father H0001 loved H0157 (8804).
027:015 And Rebekah H7259 took H3947 (8799) goodly H2532 raiment H0899 of her eldest H1419 son H1121 Esau H6215, which [were] with her in the house H1004, and put them upon H3847 (8686) Jacob H3290 her younger H6996 son H1121:
027:016 And she put H3847 (8689) the skins H5785 of the kids H1423 of the goats H5795 upon his hands H3027, and upon the smooth H2513 of his neck H6677:
027:017 And she gave H5414 (8799) the savoury meat H4303 and the bread H3899, which she had prepared H6213 (8804), into the hand H3027 of her son H1121 Jacob H3290.
027:018 And he came H0935 (8799) unto his father H0001, and said H0559 (8799), My father H0001: and he said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son H1121?
027:019 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, I [am] Esau H6215 thy firstborn H1060; I have done H6213 (8804) according as thou badest H1696 (8765) me: arise H6965 (8798), I pray thee, sit H3427 (8798) and eat H0398 (8798) of my venison H6718, that thy soul H5315 may bless H1288 (8762) me.
027:020 And Isaac H3327 said H0559 (8799) unto his son H1121, How [is it] that thou hast found H4672 (8800) [it] so quickly H4116 (8765), my son H1121? And he said H0559 (8799), Because the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 brought H7136 (8689) [it] to me H6440.
027:021 And Isaac H3327 said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, Come near H5066 (8798), I pray thee, that I may feel H4184 (8799) thee, my son H1121, whether thou [be] my very H2088 son H1121 Esau H6215 or not.
027:022 And Jacob H3290 went near H5066 (8799) unto Isaac H3327 his father H0001; and he felt H4959 (8799) him, and said H0559 (8799), The voice H6963 [is] Jacob’s H3290 voice H6963, but the hands H3027 [are] the hands H3027 of Esau H6215.
027:023 And he discerned H5234 (8689) him not, because his hands H3027 were hairy H8163, as his brother H0251 Esau’s H6215 hands H3027: so he blessed H1288 (8762) him.
027:024 And he said H0559 (8799), [Art] thou my very son H1121 Esau H6215? And he said H0559 (8799), I [am].
027:025 And he said H0559 (8799), Bring [it] near H5066 (8685) to me, and I will eat H0398 (8799) of my son’s H1121 venison H6718, that my soul H5315 may bless H1288 (8762) thee. And he brought [it] near H5066 (8686) to him, and he did eat H0398 (8799): and he brought H0935 (8686) him wine H3196, and he drank H8354 (8799).
027:026 And his father H0001 Isaac H3327 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Come near H5066 (8798) now, and kiss H5401 (8798) me, my son H1121.
027:027 And he came near H5066 (8799), and kissed H5401 (8799) him: and he smelled H7306 (8686) the smell H7381 of his raiment H0899, and blessed H1288 (8762) him, and said H0559 (8799), See H7200 (8798), the smell H7381 of my son H1121 [is] as the smell H7381 of a field H7704 which the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765):
027:028 Therefore God H0430 give H5414 (8799) thee of the dew H2919 of heaven H8064, and the fatness H4924 of the earth H0776, and plenty H7230 of corn H1715 and wine H8492:
027:029 Let people H5971 serve H5647 (8799) thee, and nations H3816 bow down H7812 (8691) to thee: be H1933 (8798) lord H1376 over thy brethren H0251, and let thy mother’s H0517 sons H1121 bow down H7812 (8691) to thee: cursed H0779 (8803) [be] every one that curseth H0779 (8802) thee, and blessed H1288 (8803) [be] he that blesseth H1288 (8764) thee.
027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac H3327 had made an end H3615 (8765) of blessing H1288 (8763) Jacob H3290, and Jacob H3290 was yet H0389 scarce H3318 (8800) gone out H3318 (8804) from the presence H6440 of Isaac H3327 his father H0001, that Esau H6215 his brother H0251 came in H0935 (8804) from his hunting H6718.
027:031 And he also had made H6213 (8799) savoury meat H4303, and brought it H0935 (8686) unto his father H0001, and said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, Let my father H0001 arise H6965 (8799), and eat H0398 (8799) of his son’s H1121 venison H6718, that thy soul H5315 may bless H1288 (8762) me.
027:032 And Isaac H3327 his father H0001 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Who [art] thou? And he said H0559 (8799), I [am] thy son H1121, thy firstborn H1060 Esau H6215.
027:033 And Isaac H3327 trembled H2729 (8799) very H1419 exceedingly H3966 H2731, and said H0559 (8799), Who? where H0645 [is] he that hath taken H6679 (8801) venison H6718, and brought H0935 (8686) [it] me, and I have eaten H0398 (8799) of all before thou camest H0935 (8799), and have blessed H1288 (8762) him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed H1288 (8803).
027:034 And when Esau H6215 heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of his father H0001, he cried H6817 (8799) with a great H1419 and exceeding H3966 bitter H4751 cry H6818, and said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, Bless H1288 (8761) me, [even] me also, O my father H0001.
027:035 And he said H0559 (8799), Thy brother H0251 came H0935 (8804) with subtilty H4820, and hath taken away H3947 (8799) thy blessing H1293.
027:036 And he said H0559 (8799), Is not he rightly H3588 named H7121 (8804) H8034 Jacob H3290? for he hath supplanted me H6117 (8799) these H2088 two times H6471: he took away H3947 (8804) my birthright H1062; and, behold, now he hath taken away H3947 (8804) my blessing H1293. And he said H0559 (8799), Hast thou not reserved H0680 (8804) a blessing H1293 for me?
027:037 And Isaac H3327 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto Esau H6215, Behold, I have made H7760 (8804) him thy lord H1376, and all his brethren H0251 have I given H5414 (8804) to him for servants H5650; and with corn H1715 and wine H8492 have I sustained H5564 (8804) him: and what shall I do H6213 (8799) now H0645 unto thee, my son H1121?
027:038 And Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, Hast thou but one H0259 blessing H1293, my father H0001? bless H1288 (8761) me, [even] me also, O my father H0001. And Esau H6215 lifted up H5375 (8799) his voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
027:039 And Isaac H3327 his father H0001 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, thy dwelling H4186 shall be the fatness H4924 of the earth H0776, and of the dew H2919 of heaven H8064 from above H5920;
027:040 And by thy sword H2719 shalt thou live H2421 (8799), and shalt serve H5647 (8799) thy brother H0251; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion H7300 (8686), that thou shalt break H6561 (8804) his yoke H5923 from off thy neck H6677.
027:041 And Esau H6215 hated H7852 (8799) Jacob H3290 because H5921 of the blessing H1293 wherewith H0834 his father H0001 blessed him H1288 (8765): and Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799) in his heart H3820, The days H3117 of mourning H0060 for my father H0001 are at hand H7126 (8799); then will I slay H2026 (8799) my brother H0251 Jacob H3290.
027:042 And these words H1697 of Esau H6215 her elder H1419 son H1121 were told H5046 (8714) to Rebekah H7259: and she sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) Jacob H3290 her younger H6996 son H1121, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold, thy brother H0251 Esau H6215, as touching thee, doth comfort H5162 (8693) himself, [purposing] to kill H2026 (8800) thee.
027:043 Now therefore, my son H1121, obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963; and arise H6965 (8798), flee H1272 (8798) thou to Laban H3837 my brother H0251 to Haran H2771;
027:044 And tarry H3427 (8804) with him a few H0259 days H3117, until H0834 thy brother’s H0251 fury H2534 turn away H7725 (8799);
027:045 Until thy brother’s H0251 anger H0639 turn away H7725 (8800) from thee, and he forget H7911 (8804) [that] which thou hast done H6213 (8804) to him: then I will send H7971 (8804), and fetch H3947 (8804) thee from thence: why H4100 should I be deprived H7921 (8799) also of you both H8147 in one H0259 day H3117?
027:046 And Rebekah H7259 said H0559 (8799) to Isaac H3327, I am weary H6973 (8804) of my life H2416 because H6440 of the daughters H1323 of Heth H2845: if Jacob H3290 take H3947 (8802) a wife H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Heth H2845, such as these [which are] of the daughters H1323 of the land H0776, what good H4100 shall my life H2416 do me?
028:001 ¶ And Isaac H3327 called H7121 (8799) Jacob H3290, and blessed H1288 (8762) him, and charged H6680 (8762) him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Canaan H3667.
028:002 Arise H6965 (8798), go H3212 (8798) to Padanaram H6307, to the house H1004 of Bethuel H1328 thy mother’s H0517 father H0001; and take H3947 (8798) thee a wife H0802 from thence of the daughters H1323 of Laban H3837 thy mother’s H0517 brother H0251.
028:003 And God H0410 Almighty H7706 bless H1288 (8762) thee, and make thee fruitful H6509 (8686), and multiply H7235 (8686) thee, that thou mayest be a multitude H6951 of people H5971;
028:004 And give H5414 (8799) thee the blessing H1293 of Abraham H0085, to thee, and to thy seed H2233 with thee; that thou mayest inherit H3423 (8800) the land H0776 wherein thou art a stranger H4033, which God H0430 gave H5414 (8804) unto Abraham H0085.
028:005 And Isaac H3327 sent away H7971 (8799) Jacob H3290: and he went H3212 (8799) to Padanaram H6307 unto Laban H3837, son H1121 of Bethuel H1328 the Syrian H0761, the brother H0251 of Rebekah H7259, Jacob’s H3290 and Esau’s H6215 mother H0517.
028:006 When Esau H6215 saw H7200 (8799) that Isaac H3327 had blessed H1288 (8765) Jacob H3290, and sent him away H7971 (8765) to Padanaram H6307, to take H3947 (8800) him a wife H0802 from thence; and that as he blessed H1288 (8763) him he gave him a charge H6680 (8762), saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Canaan H3667;
028:007 And that Jacob H3290 obeyed H8085 (8799) his father H0001 and his mother H0517, and was gone H3212 (8799) to Padanaram H6307;
028:008 And Esau H6215 seeing H7200 (8799) that the daughters H1323 of Canaan H3667 pleased H5869 not H7451 Isaac H3327 his father H0001;
028:009 Then went H3212 (8799) Esau H6215 unto Ishmael H3458, and took H3947 (8799) unto the wives H0802 which he had Mahalath H4258 the daughter H1323 of Ishmael H3458 Abraham’s H0085 son H1121, the sister H0269 of Nebajoth H5032, to be his wife H0802.
028:010 And Jacob H3290 went out H3318 (8799) from Beersheba H0884, and went H3212 (8799) toward Haran H2771.
028:011 And he lighted H6293 (8799) upon a certain place H4725, and tarried there all night H3885 (8799), because the sun H8121 was set H0935 (8804); and he took H3947 (8799) of the stones H0068 of that place H4725, and put H7760 (8799) [them for] his pillows H4763, and lay down H7901 in that place H4725 to sleep H7901 (8799).
028:012 And he dreamed H2492 (8799), and behold a ladder H5551 set up H5324 (8716) on the earth H0776, and the top of it H7218 reached H5060 (8688) to heaven H8064: and behold the angels H4397 of God H0430 ascending H5927 (8802) and descending H3381 (8802) on it.
028:013 And, behold, the LORD H3068 stood H5324 (8737) above it, and said H0559 (8799), I [am] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Abraham H0085 thy father H0001, and the God H0430 of Isaac H3327: the land H0776 whereon thou liest H7901 (8802), to thee will I give it H5414 (8799), and to thy seed H2233;
028:014 And thy seed H2233 shall be as the dust H6083 of the earth H0776, and thou shalt spread abroad H6555 (8804) to the west H3220, and to the east H6924, and to the north H6828, and to the south H5045: and in thee and in thy seed H2233 shall all the families H4940 of the earth H0127 be blessed H1288 (8738).
028:015 And, behold, I [am] with thee, and will keep H8104 (8804) thee in all [places] whither H0834 thou goest H3212 (8799), and will bring thee again H7725 (8689) into this land H0127; for I will not leave H5800 (8799) thee, until H0834 I have done H6213 (8804) [that] which I have spoken H1696 (8765) to thee of.
028:016 And Jacob H3290 awaked H3364 (8799) out of his sleep H8142, and he said H0559 (8799), Surely H0403 the LORD H3068 is H3426 in this place H4725; and I knew H3045 (8804) [it] not.
028:017 And he was afraid H3372 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), How dreadful H3372 (8737) [is] this place H4725! this [is] none other but the house H1004 of God H0430, and this [is] the gate H8179 of heaven H8064.
028:018 And Jacob H3290 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and took H3947 (8799) the stone H0068 that he had put H7760 (8804) [for] his pillows H4763, and set it up H7760 (8799) [for] a pillar H4676, and poured H3332 (8799) oil H8081 upon the top of it H7218.
028:019 And he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Bethel H1008: but H0199 the name H8034 of that city H5892 [was called] Luz H3870 at the first H7223.
028:020 And Jacob H3290 vowed H5087 (8799) a vow H5088, saying H0559 (8800), If God H0430 will be with me, and will keep me H8104 (8804) in this way H1870 that I go H1980 (8802), and will give H5414 (8804) me bread H3899 to eat H0398 (8800), and raiment H0899 to put on H3847 (8800),
028:021 So that I come again H7725 (8804) to my father’s H0001 house H1004 in peace H7965; then shall the LORD H3068 be my God H0430:
028:022 And this stone H0068, which I have set H7760 (8804) [for] a pillar H4676, shall be God’s H0430 house H1004: and of all that thou shalt give H5414 (8799) me I will surely H6237 (8763) give the tenth H6237 (8762) unto thee.
029:001 ¶ Then Jacob H3290 went on H5375 (8799) his journey H7272, and came H3212 (8799) into the land H0776 of the people H1121 of the east H6924.
029:002 And he looked H7200 (8799), and behold a well H0875 in the field H7704, and, lo, there [were] three H7969 flocks H5739 of sheep H6629 lying H7257 (8802) by it; for out of that well H0875 they watered H8248 (8686) the flocks H5739: and a great H1419 stone H0068 [was] upon the well’s H0875 mouth H6310.
029:003 And thither were all the flocks H5739 gathered H0622 (8738): and they rolled H1556 (8804) the stone H0068 from the well’s H0875 mouth H6310, and watered H8248 (8689) the sheep H6629, and put H7725 the stone H0068 again H7725 (8689) upon the well’s H0875 mouth H6310 in his place H4725.
029:004 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto them, My brethren H0251, whence H0370 [be] ye? And they said H0559 (8799), Of Haran H2771 [are] we.
029:005 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Know H3045 (8804) ye Laban H3837 the son H1121 of Nahor H5152? And they said H0559 (8799), We know H3045 (8804) [him].
029:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, [Is] he well H7965? And they said H0559 (8799), [He is] well H7965: and, behold, Rachel H7354 his daughter H1323 cometh H0935 (8802) with the sheep H6629.
029:007 And he said H0559 (8799), Lo H2005, [it is] yet high H1419 day H3117, neither [is it] time H6256 that the cattle H4735 should be gathered together H0622 (8736): water H8248 (8685) ye the sheep H6629, and go H3212 (8798) [and] feed H7462 (8798) [them].
029:008 And they said H0559 (8799), We cannot H3201 (8799), until all the flocks H5739 be gathered together H0622 (8735), and [till] they roll H1556 (8804) the stone H0068 from the well’s H0875 mouth H6310; then we water H8248 (8689) the sheep H6629.
029:009 And while he yet H5750 spake H1696 (8764) with them, Rachel H7354 came H0935 (8804) with her father’s H0001 sheep H6629: for she kept them H7462 (8802).
029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob H3290 saw H7200 (8804) Rachel H7354 the daughter H1323 of Laban H3837 his mother’s H0517 brother H0251, and the sheep H6629 of Laban H3837 his mother’s H0517 brother H0251, that Jacob H3290 went near H5066 (8799), and rolled H1556 (8686) the stone H0068 from the well’s H0875 mouth H6310, and watered H8248 (8686) the flock H6629 of Laban H3837 his mother’s H0517 brother H0251.
029:011 And Jacob H3290 kissed H5401 (8799) Rachel H7354, and lifted up H5375 (8799) his voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799).
029:012 And Jacob H3290 told H5046 (8686) Rachel H7354 that he [was] her father’s H0001 brother H0251, and that he [was] Rebekah’s H7259 son H1121: and she ran H7323 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) her father H0001.
029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban H3837 heard H8085 (8800) the tidings H8088 of Jacob H3290 his sister’s H0269 son H1121, that he ran H7323 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and embraced H2263 (8762) him, and kissed H5401 (8762) him, and brought H0935 (8686) him to his house H1004. And he told H5608 (8762) Laban H3837 all these things H1697.
029:014 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799) to him, Surely H0389 thou [art] my bone H6106 and my flesh H1320. And he abode H3427 (8799) with him the space H3117 of a month H2320.
029:015 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, Because thou [art] my brother H0251, shouldest thou therefore serve H5647 (8804) me for nought H2600? tell H5046 (8685) me, what [shall] thy wages H4909 [be]?
029:016 And Laban H3837 had two H8147 daughters H1323: the name H8034 of the elder H1419 [was] Leah H3812, and the name H8034 of the younger H6996 [was] Rachel H7354.
029:017 Leah H3812 [was] tender H7390 eyed H5869; but Rachel H7354 was beautiful H3303 H8389 and well H3303 favoured H4758.
029:018 And Jacob H3290 loved H0157 (8799) Rachel H7354; and said H0559 (8799), I will serve H5647 (8799) thee seven H7651 years H8141 for Rachel H7354 thy younger H6996 daughter H1323.
029:019 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799), [It is] better H2896 that I give H5414 (8800) her to thee, than that I should give H5414 (8800) her to another H0312 man H0376: abide H3427 (8798) with me.
029:020 And Jacob H3290 served H5647 (8799) seven H7651 years H8141 for Rachel H7354; and they seemed H5869 unto him [but] a few H0259 days H3117, for the love he had H0160 to her.
029:021 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto Laban H3837, Give H3051 (8798) [me] my wife H0802, for my days H3117 are fulfilled H4390 (8804), that I may go in H0935 (8799) unto her.
029:022 And Laban H3837 gathered together H0622 (8799) all the men H0582 of the place H4725, and made H6213 (8799) a feast H4960.
029:023 And it came to pass in the evening H6153, that he took H3947 (8799) Leah H3812 his daughter H1323, and brought H0935 (8686) her to him; and he went in H0935 (8799) unto her.
029:024 And Laban H3837 gave H5414 (8799) unto his daughter H1323 Leah H3812 Zilpah H2153 his maid H8198 [for] an handmaid H8198.
029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning H1242, behold, it [was] Leah H3812: and he said H0559 (8799) to Laban H3837, What [is] this thou hast done H6213 (8804) unto me? did not I serve H5647 (8804) with thee for Rachel H7354? wherefore then hast thou beguiled H7411 (8765) me?
029:026 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799), It must not be so done H6213 (8735) in our country H4725, to give H5414 (8800) the younger H6810 before H6440 the firstborn H1067.
029:027 Fulfil H4390 (8761) her H2063 week H7620, and we will give H5414 (8799) thee this also for the service H5656 which thou shalt serve H5647 (8799) with me yet seven H7651 other H0312 years H8141.
029:028 And Jacob H3290 did H6213 (8799) so, and fulfilled H4390 (8762) her week H7620: and he gave H5414 (8799) him Rachel H7354 his daughter H1323 to wife H0802 also.
029:029 And Laban H3837 gave H5414 (8799) to Rachel H7354 his daughter H1323 Bilhah H1090 his handmaid H8198 to be her maid H8198.
029:030 And he went in H0935 (8799) also unto Rachel H7354, and he loved H0157 (8799) also Rachel H7354 more than Leah H3812, and served H5647 (8799) with him yet seven H7651 other H0312 years H8141.
029:031 And when the LORD H3068 saw H7200 (8799) that Leah H3812 [was] hated H8130 (8803), he opened H6605 (8799) her womb H7358: but Rachel H7354 [was] barren H6135.
029:032 And Leah H3812 conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121, and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Reuben H7205: for H3588 she said H0559 (8804), Surely H3588 the LORD H3068 hath looked H7200 (8804) upon my affliction H6040; now therefore H3588 my husband H0376 will love H0157 (8799) me.
029:033 And she conceived H2029 (8799) again, and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and said H0559 (8799), Because the LORD H3068 hath heard H8085 (8804) that I [was] hated H8130 (8803), he hath therefore given H5414 (8799) me this [son] also: and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Simeon H8095.
029:034 And she conceived again H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and said H0559 (8799), Now this time H6471 will my husband H0376 be joined H3867 (8735) unto me, because I have born H3205 (8804) him three H7969 sons H1121: therefore was his name H8034 called H7121 (8804) Levi H3878.
029:035 And she conceived H2029 (8799) again, and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121: and she said H0559 (8799), Now H6471 will I praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068: therefore she called H7121 (8804) his name H8034 Judah H3063; and left H5975 (8799) bearing H3205 (8800).
030:001 ¶ And when Rachel H7354 saw H7200 (8799) that she bare H3205 (8804) Jacob H3290 no children, Rachel H7354 envied H7065 (8762) her sister H0269; and said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, Give H3051 (8798) me children H1121, or else H0369 I die H4191 (8801).
030:002 And Jacob’s H3290 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Rachel H7354: and he said H0559 (8799), [Am] I in God’s H0430 stead, who hath withheld H4513 (8804) from thee the fruit H6529 of the womb H0990?
030:003 And she said H0559 (8799), Behold my maid H0519 Bilhah H1090, go in H0935 (8798) unto her; and she shall bear H3205 (8799) upon my knees H1290, that I may also have children H1129 (8735) by her.
030:004 And she gave H5414 (8799) him Bilhah H1090 her handmaid H8198 to wife H0802: and Jacob H3290 went in H0935 (8799) unto her.
030:005 And Bilhah H1090 conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 a son H1121.
030:006 And Rachel H7354 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath judged H1777 (8804) me, and hath also heard H8085 (8804) my voice H6963, and hath given H5414 (8799) me a son H1121: therefore called H7121 (8804) she his name H8034 Dan H1835.
030:007 And Bilhah H1090 Rachel’s H7354 maid H8198 conceived H2029 (8799) again, and bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 a second H8145 son H1121.
030:008 And Rachel H7354 said H0559 (8799), With great H0430 wrestlings H5319 have I wrestled H6617 (8738) with my sister H0269, and I have prevailed H3201 (8804): and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Naphtali H5321.
030:009 When Leah H3812 saw H7200 (8799) that she had left H5975 (8804) bearing H3205 (8800), she took H3947 (8799) Zilpah H2153 her maid H8198, and gave H5414 (8799) her Jacob H3290 to wife H0802.
030:010 And Zilpah H2153 Leah’s H3812 maid H8198 bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 a son H1121.
030:011 And Leah H3812 said H0559 (8799), A troop H1409 cometh H0935 (8804): and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Gad H1410.
030:012 And Zilpah H2153 Leah’s H3812 maid H8198 bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 a second H8145 son H1121.
030:013 And Leah H3812 said H0559 (8799), Happy am I H0837, for the daughters H1323 will call me blessed H0833 (8765): and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Asher H0836.
030:014 And Reuben H7205 went in H3212 (8799) the days H3117 of wheat H2406 harvest H7105, and found H4672 (8799) mandrakes H1736 in the field H7704, and brought H0935 (8686) them unto his mother H0517 Leah H3812. Then Rachel H7354 said H0559 (8799) to Leah H3812, Give me H5414 (8798), I pray thee, of thy son’s H1121 mandrakes H1736.
030:015 And she said H0559 (8799) unto her, [Is it] a small matter H4592 that thou hast taken H3947 (8800) my husband H0376? and wouldest thou take away H3947 (8800) my son’s H1121 mandrakes H1736 also? And Rachel H7354 said H0559 (8799), Therefore he shall lie H7901 (8799) with thee to night H3915 for H8478 thy son’s H1121 mandrakes H1736.
030:016 And Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8799) out of the field H7704 in the evening H6153, and Leah H3812 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and said H0559 (8799), Thou must come in H0935 (8799) unto me; for surely H7936 (8800) I have hired H7936 (8804) thee with my son’s H1121 mandrakes H1736. And he lay H7901 (8799) with her that night H3915.
030:017 And God H0430 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto Leah H3812, and she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 the fifth H2549 son H1121.
030:018 And Leah H3812 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) me my hire H7939, because H0834 I have given H5414 (8804) my maiden H8198 to my husband H0376: and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Issachar H3485.
030:019 And Leah H3812 conceived H2029 (8799) again, and bare H3205 (8799) Jacob H3290 the sixth H8345 son H1121.
030:020 And Leah H3812 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath endued H2064 (8804) me [with] a good H2896 dowry H2065; now H6471 will my husband H0376 dwell H2082 (8799) with me, because I have born H3205 (8804) him six H8337 sons H1121: and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Zebulun H2074.
030:021 And afterwards H0310 she bare H3205 (8804) a daughter H1323, and called H7121 (8799) her name H8034 Dinah H1783.
030:022 And God H0430 remembered H2142 (8799) Rachel H7354, and God H0430 hearkened H8085 (8799) to her, and opened H6605 (8799) her womb H7358.
030:023 And she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath taken away H0622 (8804) my reproach H2781:
030:024 And she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Joseph H3130; and said H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 shall add H3254 (8686) to me another H0312 son H1121.
030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel H7354 had born H3205 (8804) Joseph H3130, that Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto Laban H3837, Send me away H7971 (8761), that I may go H3212 (8799) unto mine own place H4725, and to my country H0776.
030:026 Give H5414 (8798) [me] my wives H0802 and my children H3206, for H2004 whom I have served H5647 (8804) thee, and let me go H3212 (8799): for thou knowest H3045 (8804) my service H5656 which I have done H5647 (8804) thee.
030:027 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799) unto him, I pray thee, if I have found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in thine eyes H5869, [tarry: for] I have learned by experience H5172 (8765) that the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8762) me for thy sake H1558.
030:028 And he said H0559 (8799), Appoint H5344 (8798) me thy wages H7939, and I will give H5414 (8799) [it].
030:029 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou knowest H3045 (8804) how H0834 I have served H5647 (8804) thee, and how H0834 thy cattle H4735 was with me.
030:030 For [it was] little H4592 which thou hadst before I H6440 [came], and it is [now] increased H6555 (8799) unto a multitude H7230; and the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8762) thee since my coming H7272: and now when H4970 shall I provide H6213 (8799) for mine own house H1004 also?
030:031 And he said H0559 (8799), What shall I give thee H5414 (8799)? And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt not give H5414 (8799) me any thing H3972: if thou wilt do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697 for me, I will again H7725 (8799) feed H7462 (8799) [and] keep H8104 (8799) thy flock H6629:
030:032 I will pass H5674 (8799) through all thy flock H6629 to day H3117, removing H5493 (8687) from thence all the speckled H5348 and spotted H2921 (8803) cattle H7716, and all the brown H2345 cattle H7716 among the sheep H3775, and the spotted H2921 (8803) and speckled H5348 among the goats H5795: and [of such] shall be my hire H7939.
030:033 So shall my righteousness H6666 answer H6030 (8804) for me in time H3117 to come H4279, when it shall come H0935 (8799) for my hire H7939 before thy face H6440: every one H3605 that [is] not speckled H5348 and spotted H2921 (8803) among the goats H5795, and brown H2345 among the sheep H3775, that shall be counted stolen H1589 (8803) with me.
030:034 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799), Behold, I would it might be H3863 according to thy word H1697.
030:035 And he removed H5493 (8686) that day H3117 the he goats H8495 that were ringstraked H6124 and spotted H2921 (8803), and all the she goats H5795 that were speckled H5348 and spotted H2921 (8803), [and] every one that had [some] white H3836 in it, and all the brown H2345 among the sheep H3775, and gave H5414 (8799) [them] into the hand H3027 of his sons H1121.
030:036 And he set H7760 (8799) three H7969 days H3117 ’ journey H1870 betwixt himself and Jacob H3290: and Jacob H3290 fed H7462 (8802) the rest H3498 (8737) of Laban’s H3837 flocks H6629.
030:037 And Jacob H3290 took H3947 (8799) him rods H4731 of green H3892 poplar H3839, and of the hazel H3869 and chesnut tree H6196; and pilled H6478 (8762) white H3836 strakes H6479 in them, and made the white H3836 appear H4286 which [was] in the rods H4731.
030:038 And he set H3322 (8686) the rods H4731 which he had pilled H6478 (8765) before H5227 the flocks H6629 in the gutters H7298 in the watering H4325 troughs H8268 when the flocks H6629 came H0935 (8799) to drink H8354 (8800), that they should conceive H3179 (8799) when they came H0935 (8800) to drink H8354 (8800).
030:039 And the flocks H6629 conceived H3179 (8799) before the rods H4731, and brought forth H3205 (8799) cattle H6629 ringstraked H6124, speckled H5348, and spotted H2921 (8803).
030:040 And Jacob H3290 did separate H6504 (8689) the lambs H3775, and set H5414 (8799) the faces H6440 of the flocks H6629 toward H0413 the ringstraked H6124, and all the brown H2345 in the flock H6629 of Laban H3837; and he put H7896 (8799) his own flocks H5739 by themselves, and put H7896 (8804) them not unto Laban’s H3837 cattle H6629.
030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger H7194 (8794) cattle H6629 did conceive H3179 (8763), that Jacob H3290 laid H7760 (8804) the rods H4731 before the eyes H5869 of the cattle H6629 in the gutters H7298, that they might conceive H3179 (8763) among the rods H4731.
030:042 But when the cattle H6629 were feeble H5848 (8687), he put [them] not in H7760 (8799): so the feebler H5848 (8803) were Laban’s H3837, and the stronger H7194 (8803) Jacob’s H3290.
030:043 And the man H0376 increased H6555 (8799) exceedingly H3966 H3966, and had much H7227 cattle H6629, and maidservants H8198, and menservants H5650, and camels H1581, and asses H2543.
031:001 ¶ And he heard H8085 (8799) the words H1697 of Laban’s H3837 sons H1121, saying H0559 (8800), Jacob H3290 hath taken away H3947 (8804) all that [was] our father’s H0001; and of [that] which [was] our father’s H0001 hath he gotten H6213 (8804) all this glory H3519.
031:002 And Jacob H3290 beheld H7200 (8799) the countenance H6440 of Laban H3837, and, behold, it [was] not toward him as H8543 before H8032.
031:003 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, Return H7725 (8798) unto the land H0776 of thy fathers H0001, and to thy kindred H4138; and I will be with thee.
031:004 And Jacob H3290 sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) Rachel H7354 and Leah H3812 to the field H7704 unto his flock H6629,
031:005 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, I see H7200 (8802) your father’s H0001 countenance H6440, that it [is] not toward me as H8543 before H8032; but the God H0430 of my father H0001 hath been H1961 (8804) with me.
031:006 And ye H0859 know H3045 (8804) that with all my power H3581 I have served H5647 (8804) your father H0001.
031:007 And your father H0001 hath deceived H2048 (8765) me, and changed H2498 (8689) my wages H4909 ten H6235 times H4489; but God H0430 suffered him H5414 (8804) not to hurt H7489 (8687) me H5978.
031:008 If he said H0559 (8799) thus, The speckled H5348 shall be thy wages H7939; then all the cattle H6629 bare H3205 (8804) speckled H5348: and if he said H0559 (8799) thus, The ringstraked H6124 shall be thy hire H7939; then bare H3205 (8804) all the cattle H6629 ringstraked H6124.
031:009 Thus God H0430 hath taken away H5337 (8686) the cattle H4735 of your father H0001, and given H5414 (8799) [them] to me.
031:010 And it came to pass at the time H6256 that the cattle H6629 conceived H3179 (8763), that I lifted up H5375 (8799) mine eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) in a dream H2472, and, behold, the rams H6260 which leaped H5927 (8802) upon the cattle H6629 [were] ringstraked H6124, speckled H5348, and grisled H1261.
031:011 And the angel H4397 of God H0430 spake H0559 (8799) unto me in a dream H2472, [saying], Jacob H3290: And I said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
031:012 And he said H0559 (8799), Lift up H5375 (8798) now thine eyes H5869, and see H7200 (8798), all the rams H6260 which leap H5927 (8802) upon the cattle H6629 [are] ringstraked H6124, speckled H5348, and grisled H1261: for I have seen H7200 (8804) all that Laban H3837 doeth H6213 (8802) unto thee.
031:013 I [am] the God H0410 of Bethel H1008, where thou anointedst H4886 (8804) the pillar H4676, [and] where thou vowedst H5087 (8804) a vow H5088 unto me: now arise H6965 (8798), get thee out H3318 (8798) from this land H0776, and return H7725 (8798) unto the land H0776 of thy kindred H4138.
031:014 And Rachel H7354 and Leah H3812 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Is there] yet any portion H2506 or inheritance H5159 for us in our father’s H0001 house H1004?
031:015 Are we not counted H2803 (8738) of him strangers H5237? for he hath sold H4376 (8804) us, and hath quite H0398 (8800) devoured H0398 (8799) also our money H3701.
031:016 For all the riches H6239 which God H0430 hath taken H5337 (8689) from our father H0001, that [is] ours, and our children’s H1121: now then, whatsoever God H0430 hath said H0559 (8804) unto thee, do H6213 (8798).
031:017 Then Jacob H3290 rose up H6965 (8799), and set H5375 (8799) his sons H1121 and his wives H0802 upon camels H1581;
031:018 And he carried away H5090 (8799) all his cattle H4735, and all his goods H7399 which he had gotten H7408 (8804), the cattle H4735 of his getting H7075, which he had gotten H7408 (8804) in Padanaram H6307, for to go H0935 (8800) to Isaac H3327 his father H0001 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
031:019 And Laban H3837 went H1980 (8804) to shear H1494 (8800) his sheep H6629: and Rachel H7354 had stolen H1589 (8799) the images H8655 that [were] her father’s H0001.
031:020 And Jacob H3290 stole away H1589 (8799) unawares H3820 to Laban H3837 the Syrian H0761, in that H5921 he told H5046 (8689) him not H1097 that he fled H1272 (8802).
031:021 So he fled H1272 (8799) with all that he had; and he rose up H6965 (8799), and passed over H5674 (8799) the river H5104, and set H7760 (8799) his face H6440 [toward] the mount H2022 Gilead H1568.
031:022 And it was told H5046 (8714) Laban H3837 on the third H7992 day H3117 that Jacob H3290 was fled H1272 (8804).
031:023 And he took H3947 (8799) his brethren H0251 with him, and pursued H7291 (8799) after him H0310 seven H7651 days H3117 ’ journey H1870; and they overtook H1692 (8686) him in the mount H2022 Gilead H1568.
031:024 And God H0430 came H0935 (8799) to Laban H3837 the Syrian H0761 in a dream H2472 by night H3915, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Take heed H8104 (8734) that thou speak H1696 (8762) not to H5973 Jacob H3290 either good H2896 or H5704 bad H7451.
031:025 Then Laban H3837 overtook H5381 (8686) Jacob H3290. Now Jacob H3290 had pitched H8628 (8804) his tent H0168 in the mount H2022: and Laban H3837 with his brethren H0251 pitched H8628 (8804) in the mount H2022 of Gilead H1568.
031:026 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799) to Jacob H3290, What hast thou done H6213 (8804), that thou hast stolen away H1589 (8799) unawares H3824 to me, and carried away H5090 (8762) my daughters H1323, as captives H7617 (8803) [taken] with the sword H2719?
031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away H1272 (8800) secretly H2244 (8738), and steal away H1589 (8799) from me; and didst not tell H5046 (8689) me, that I might have sent thee away H7971 (8762) with mirth H8057, and with songs H7892, with tabret H8596, and with harp H3658?
031:028 And hast not suffered H5203 (8804) me to kiss H5401 (8763) my sons H1121 and my daughters H1323? thou hast now done foolishly H5528 (8689) in [so] doing H6213 (8800).
031:029 It is H3426 in the power H0410 of my hand H3027 to do H6213 (8800) you hurt H7451: but the God H0430 of your father H0001 spake H0559 (8804) unto me yesternight H0570, saying H0559 (8800), Take thou heed H8104 (8734) that thou speak not H1696 (8763) to Jacob H3290 either good H2896 or bad H7451.
031:030 And now, [though] thou wouldest needs H1980 (8800) be gone H1980 (8804), because thou sore H3700 (8736) longedst H3700 (8738) after thy father’s H0001 house H1004, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen H1589 (8804) my gods H0430?
031:031 And Jacob H3290 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) to Laban H3837, Because I was afraid H3372 (8804): for I said H0559 (8804), Peradventure H6435 thou wouldest take by force H1497 (8799) thy daughters H1323 from me.
031:032 With whomsoever H0834 thou findest H4672 (8799) thy gods H0430, let him not live H2421 (8799): before H5048 our brethren H0251 discern H5234 (8685) thou what [is] thine with me, and take H3947 (8798) [it] to thee. For Jacob H3290 knew H3045 (8804) not that Rachel H7354 had stolen H1589 (8804) them.
031:033 And Laban H3837 went H0935 (8799) into Jacob’s H3290 tent H0168, and into Leah’s H3812 tent H0168, and into the two H8147 maidservants H0519 ’ tents H0168; but he found H4672 (8804) [them] not. Then went he out H3318 (8799) of Leah’s H3812 tent H0168, and entered H0935 (8799) into Rachel’s H7354 tent H0168.
031:034 Now Rachel H7354 had taken H3947 (8804) the images H8655, and put H7760 (8799) them in the camel’s H1581 furniture H3733, and sat H3427 (8799) upon them. And Laban H3837 searched H4959 (8762) all the tent H0168, but found H4672 (8804) [them] not.
031:035 And she said H0559 (8799) to her father H0001, Let it not displease H2734 (8799) H5869 my lord H0113 that I cannot H3201 (8799) rise up H6965 (8800) before thee H6440; for the custom H1870 of women H0802 [is] upon me. And he searched H2664 (8762), but found H4672 (8804) not the images H8655.
031:036 And Jacob H3290 was wroth H2734 (8799), and chode H7378 (8799) with Laban H3837: and Jacob H3290 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) to Laban H3837, What [is] my trespass H6588? what [is] my sin H2403, that thou hast so hotly pursued H1814 (8804) after me H0310?
031:037 Whereas H3588 thou hast searched H4959 (8765) all my stuff H3627, what hast thou found H4672 (8804) of all thy household H1004 stuff H3627? set H7760 (8798) [it] here H3541 before my brethren H0251 and thy brethren H0251, that they may judge H3198 (8686) betwixt H0996 us both H8147.
031:038 This twenty H6242 years H8141 [have] I [been] with thee; thy ewes H7353 and thy she goats H5795 have not cast their young H7921 (8765), and the rams H0352 of thy flock H6629 have I not eaten H0398 (8804).
031:039 That which was torn H2966 [of beasts] I brought H0935 (8689) not unto thee; I bare the loss H2398 (8762) of it; of my hand H3027 didst thou require H1245 (8762) it, [whether] stolen H1589 (8803) by day H3117, or stolen H1589 (8803) by night H3915.
031:040 [Thus] I was; in the day H3117 the drought H2721 consumed H0398 (8804) me, and the frost H7140 by night H3915; and my sleep H8142 departed H5074 (8799) from mine eyes H5869.
031:041 Thus have I been twenty H6242 years H8141 in thy house H1004; I served thee H5647 (8804) fourteen H0702 H6240 years H8141 for thy two H8147 daughters H1323, and six H8337 years H8141 for thy cattle H6629: and thou hast changed H2498 (8686) my wages H4909 ten H6235 times H4489.
031:042 Except H3884 the God H0430 of my father H0001, the God H0430 of Abraham H0085, and the fear H6343 of Isaac H3327, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away H7971 (8765) now empty H7387. God H0430 hath seen H7200 (8804) mine affliction H6040 and the labour H3018 of my hands H3709, and rebuked H3198 (8686) [thee] yesternight H0570.
031:043 And Laban H3837 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, [These] daughters H1323 [are] my daughters H1323, and [these] children H1121 [are] my children H1121, and [these] cattle H6629 [are] my cattle H6629, and all that thou seest H7200 (8802) [is] mine: and what can I do H6213 (8799) this day H3117 unto these my daughters H1323, or H0176 unto their children H1121 which they have born H3205 (8804)?
031:044 Now therefore come thou H3212 (8798), let us make H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285, I and thou; and let it be for a witness H5707 between me and thee.
031:045 And Jacob H3290 took H3947 (8799) a stone H0068, and set it up H7311 (8686) [for] a pillar H4676.
031:046 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, Gather H3950 (8798) stones H0068; and they took H3947 (8799) stones H0068, and made H6213 (8799) an heap H1530: and they did eat H0398 (8799) there upon the heap H1530.
031:047 And Laban H3837 called H7121 (8799) it Jegarsahadutha H3026: but Jacob H3290 called H7121 (8804) it Galeed H1567.
031:048 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799), This heap H1530 [is] a witness H5707 between me and thee this day H3117. Therefore was the name H8034 of it called H7121 (8804) Galeed H1567;
031:049 And Mizpah H4709; for H0834 he said H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 watch H6822 (8799) between me and thee, when we are absent H5641 (8735) one H0376 from another H7453.
031:050 If thou shalt afflict H6031 (8762) my daughters H1323, or if thou shalt take H3947 (8799) [other] wives H0802 beside H5921 my daughters H1323, no man H0376 [is] with us; see H7200 (8798), God H0430 [is] witness H5707 betwixt me and thee.
031:051 And Laban H3837 said H0559 (8799) to Jacob H3290, Behold this heap H1530, and behold [this] pillar H4676, which I have cast H3384 (8804) betwixt me and thee;
031:052 This heap H1530 [be] witness H5707, and [this] pillar H4676 [be] witness H5713, that I will not pass over H5674 (8799) this heap H1530 to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over H5674 (8799) this heap H1530 and this pillar H4676 unto me, for harm H7451.
031:053 The God H0430 of Abraham H0085, and the God H0430 of Nahor H5152, the God H0430 of their father H0001, judge H8199 (8799) betwixt us. And Jacob H3290 sware H7650 (8735) by the fear H6343 of his father H0001 Isaac H3327.
031:054 Then Jacob H3290 offered H2076 (8799) sacrifice H2077 upon the mount H2022, and called H7121 (8799) his brethren H0251 to eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899: and they did eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899, and tarried all night H3885 (8799) in the mount H2022.
031:055 And early H7925 in the morning H1242 Laban H3837 rose up H7925 (8686), and kissed H5401 (8762) his sons H1121 and his daughters H1323, and blessed H1288 (8762) them: and Laban H3837 departed H3212 (8799), and returned H7725 (8799) unto his place H4725.
032:001 ¶ And Jacob H3290 went H1980 (8804) on his way H1870, and the angels H4397 of God H0430 met H6293 (8799) him.
032:002 And when Jacob H3290 saw them H7200 (8804), he said H0559 (8799), This [is] God’s H0430 host H4264: and he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Mahanaim H4266.
032:003 And Jacob H3290 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 before him H6440 to Esau H6215 his brother H0251 unto the land H0776 of Seir H8165, the country H7704 of Edom H0123.
032:004 And he commanded H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Thus shall ye speak H0559 (8799) unto my lord H0113 Esau H6215; Thy servant H5650 Jacob H3290 saith H0559 (8804) thus, I have sojourned H1481 (8804) with Laban H3837, and stayed there H0309 (8799) until now:
032:005 And I have oxen H7794, and asses H2543, flocks H6629, and menservants H5650, and womenservants H8198: and I have sent H7971 (8799) to tell H5046 (8687) my lord H0113, that I may find H4672 (8800) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869.
032:006 And the messengers H4397 returned H7725 (8799) to Jacob H3290, saying H0559 (8800), We came H0935 (8804) to thy brother H0251 Esau H6215, and also he cometh H1980 (8802) to meet thee H7125 (8800), and four hundred H3967 men H0376 with him.
032:007 Then Jacob H3290 was greatly H3966 afraid H3372 (8799) and distressed H3334 (8799): and he divided H2673 (8799) the people H5971 that [was] with him, and the flocks H6629, and herds H1241, and the camels H1581, into two H8147 bands H4264;
032:008 And said H0559 (8799), If Esau H6215 come H0935 (8799) to the one H0259 company H4264, and smite it H5221 (8689), then the other company H4264 which is left H7604 (8737) shall escape H6413.
032:009 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799), O God H0430 of my father H0001 Abraham H0085, and God H0430 of my father H0001 Isaac H3327, the LORD H3068 which saidst H0559 (8802) unto me, Return H7725 (8798) unto thy country H0776, and to thy kindred H4138, and I will deal well H3190 (8686) with thee:
032:010 I am not worthy of the least H6994 (8804) of all the mercies H2617, and of all the truth H0571, which thou hast shewed H6213 (8804) unto thy servant H5650; for with my staff H4731 I passed over H5674 (8804) this Jordan H3383; and now I am become two H8147 bands H4264.
032:011 Deliver me H5337 (8685), I pray thee, from the hand H3027 of my brother H0251, from the hand H3027 of Esau H6215: for I fear H3373 him, lest he will come H0935 (8799) and smite me H5221 (8689), [and] the mother H0517 with H5921 the children H1121.
032:012 And thou saidst H0559 (8804), I will surely H3190 (8687) do thee good H3190 (8686), and make H7760 (8804) thy seed H2233 as the sand H2344 of the sea H3220, which cannot be numbered H5608 (8735) for multitude H7230.
032:013 And he lodged H3885 (8799) there that same night H3915; and took H3947 (8799) of that which came H0935 (8802) to his hand H3027 a present H4503 for Esau H6215 his brother H0251;
032:014 Two hundred H3967 she goats H5795, and twenty H6242 he goats H8495, two hundred H3967 ewes H7353, and twenty H6242 rams H0352,
032:015 Thirty H7970 milch H3243 (8688) camels H1581 with their colts H1121, forty H0705 kine H6510, and ten H6235 bulls H6499, twenty H6242 she asses H0860, and ten H6235 foals H5895.
032:016 And he delivered H5414 (8799) [them] into the hand H3027 of his servants H5650, every drove H5739 by themselves; and said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, Pass over H5674 (8798) before me H6440, and put H7760 (8799) a space H7305 betwixt H0996 drove H5739 and H0996 drove H5739.
032:017 And he commanded H6680 (8762) the foremost H7223, saying H0559 (8800), When Esau H6215 my brother H0251 meeteth thee H6298 (8799), and asketh thee H7592 (8804), saying H0559 (8800), Whose [art] thou? and whither goest H3212 (8799) thou? and whose [are] these before H6440 thee?
032:018 Then thou shalt say H0559 (8804), [They be] thy servant H5650 Jacob’s H3290; it [is] a present H4503 sent H7971 (8803) unto my lord H0113 Esau H6215: and, behold, also he [is] behind us H0310.
032:019 And so H1571 commanded he H6680 (8762) the second H8145, and the third H7992, and all that followed H1980 (8802) H0310 the droves H5739, saying H0559 (8800), On this manner H1697 shall ye speak H1696 (8762) unto Esau H6215, when ye find H4672 (8800) him.
032:020 And say ye H0559 (8804) moreover H1571, Behold, thy servant H5650 Jacob H3290 [is] behind us H0310. For he said H0559 (8804), I will appease H3722 (8762) him H6440 with the present H4503 that goeth H1980 (8802) before me H6440, and afterward H0310 I will see H7200 (8799) his face H6440; peradventure he will accept H5375 (8799) of me H6440.
032:021 So went H5674 the present H4503 over H5674 (8799) before him H6440: and himself lodged H3885 (8804) that night H3915 in the company H4264.
032:022 And he rose up H6965 (8799) that night H3915, and took H3947 (8799) his two H8147 wives H0802, and his two H8147 womenservants H8198, and his eleven H6240 H0259 sons H3206, and passed over H5674 (8799) the ford H4569 Jabbok H2999.
032:023 And he took them H3947 (8799), and sent them over H5674 (8686) the brook H5158, and sent over H5674 (8686) that he had.
032:024 And Jacob H3290 was left H3498 (8735) alone; and there wrestled H0079 (8735) a man H0376 with him until the breaking H5927 (8800) of the day H7837.
032:025 And when he saw H7200 (8799) that he prevailed H3201 (8804) not against him, he touched H5060 (8799) the hollow of his thigh H3409; and the hollow H3709 of Jacob’s H3290 thigh H3409 was out of joint H3363 (8799), as he wrestled H0079 (8736) with him.
032:026 And he said H0559 (8799), Let me go H7971 (8761), for the day H7837 breaketh H5927 (8804). And he said H0559 (8799), I will not let thee go H7971 (8762), except H0518 thou bless H1288 (8765) me.
032:027 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, What [is] thy name H8034? And he said H0559 (8799), Jacob H3290.
032:028 And he said H0559 (8799), Thy name H8034 shall be called H0559 (8735) no more Jacob H3290, but Israel H3478: for as a prince hast thou power H8280 (8804) with God H0430 and with men H0582, and hast prevailed H3201 (8799).
032:029 And Jacob H3290 asked H7592 (8799) [him], and said H0559 (8799), Tell H5046 (8685) [me], I pray thee, thy name H8034. And he said H0559 (8799), Wherefore [is] it H2088 [that] thou dost ask H7592 (8799) after my name H8034? And he blessed H1288 (8762) him there.
032:030 And Jacob H3290 called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the place H4725 Peniel H6439: for I have seen H7200 (8804) God H0430 face H6440 to face H6440, and my life H5315 is preserved H5337 (8735).
032:031 And as he passed over H5674 (8804) Penuel H6439 the sun H8121 rose H2224 (8799) upon him, and he halted H6760 (8802) upon his thigh H3409.
032:032 Therefore the children H1121 of Israel H3478 eat H0398 (8799) not [of] the sinew H1517 which shrank H5384, which [is] upon the hollow H3709 of the thigh H3409, unto this day H3117: because he touched H5060 (8804) the hollow H3709 of Jacob’s H3290 thigh H3409 in the sinew H1517 that shrank H5384.
033:001 ¶ And Jacob H3290 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, Esau H6215 came H0935 (8802), and with him four H0702 hundred H3967 men H0376. And he divided H2673 (8799) the children H3206 unto Leah H3812, and unto Rachel H7354, and unto the two H8147 handmaids H8198.
033:002 And he put H7760 (8799) the handmaids H8198 and their children H3206 foremost H7223, and Leah H3812 and her children H3206 after H0314, and Rachel H7354 and Joseph H3130 hindermost H0314.
033:003 And he passed over H5674 (8804) before them H6440, and bowed himself H7812 (8691) to the ground H0776 seven H7651 times H6471, until he came near H5066 (8800) to his brother H0251.
033:004 And Esau H6215 ran H7323 (8799) to meet him H7125 (8800), and embraced H2263 (8762) him, and fell H5307 (8799) on his neck H6677, and kissed him H5401 (8799): and they wept H1058 (8799).
033:005 And he lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) the women H0802 and the children H3206; and said H0559 (8799), Who [are] those H0428 with thee? And he said H0559 (8799), The children H3206 which God H0430 hath graciously given H2603 (8804) thy servant H5650.
033:006 Then the handmaidens H8198 came near H5066 (8799), they and their children H3206, and they bowed themselves H7812 (8691).
033:007 And Leah H3812 also with her children H3206 came near H5066 (8799), and bowed themselves H7812 (8691): and after H0310 came H5066 Joseph H3130 near H5066 (8738) and Rachel H7354, and they bowed H7812 (8691) themselves.
033:008 And he said H0559 (8799), What [meanest] thou by all this drove H4264 which I met H6298 (8804)? And he said H0559 (8799), [These are] to find H4672 (8800) grace H2580 in the sight H5869 of my lord H0113.
033:009 And Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799), I have H3426 enough H7227, my brother H0251; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
033:010 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799), Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, then receive H3947 (8804) my present H4503 at my hand H3027: for therefore I have seen H7200 (8804) thy face H6440, as though I had seen H7200 (8800) the face H6440 of God H0430, and thou wast pleased with me H7521 (8799).
033:011 Take H3947 (8798), I pray thee, my blessing H1293 that is brought H0935 (8717) to thee; because God H0430 hath dealt graciously with me H2603 (8804), and because H3605 I have H3426 enough H3605. And he urged H6484 (8799) him, and he took H3947 (8799) [it].
033:012 And he said H0559 (8799), Let us take our journey H5265 (8799), and let us go H3212 (8799), and I will go H3212 (8799) before thee.
033:013 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, My lord H0113 knoweth H3045 (8802) that the children H3206 [are] tender H7390, and the flocks H6629 and herds H1241 with young H5763 (8802) [are] with me: and if men should overdrive H1849 (8804) them one H0259 day H3117, all the flock H6629 will die H4191 (8804).
033:014 Let my lord H0113, I pray thee, pass over H5674 (8799) before H6440 his servant H5650: and I will lead on H5095 (8691) softly H0328, according as H7272 the cattle H4399 that goeth before me H6440 and the children H3206 be able to endure H7272, until I come H0935 (8799) unto my lord H0113 unto Seir H8165.
033:015 And Esau H6215 said H0559 (8799), Let me now leave H3322 (8686) with thee [some] of the folk H5971 that [are] with me. And he said H0559 (8799), What H4100 needeth it? let me find H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in the sight H5869 of my lord H0113.
033:016 So Esau H6215 returned H7725 (8799) that day H3117 on his way H1870 unto Seir H8165.
033:017 And Jacob H3290 journeyed H5265 (8804) to Succoth H5523, and built H1129 (8799) him an house H1004, and made H6213 (8804) booths H5521 for his cattle H4735: therefore the name H8034 of the place H4725 is called H7121 (8804) Succoth H5523.
033:018 And Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8799) to Shalem H8004, a city H5892 of Shechem H7927, which [is] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, when he came H0935 (8800) from Padanaram H6307; and pitched his tent H2583 (8799) before H6440 the city H5892.
033:019 And he bought H7069 (8799) a parcel H2513 of a field H7704, where he had spread H5186 (8804) his tent H0168, at the hand H3027 of the children H1121 of Hamor H2544, Shechem’s H7927 father H0001, for an hundred H3967 pieces of money H7192.
033:020 And he erected H5324 (8686) there an altar H4196, and called it H7121 (8799) Elelohe-Israel H0415.
034:001 ¶ And Dinah H1783 the daughter H1323 of Leah H3812, which she bare H3205 (8804) unto Jacob H3290, went out H3318 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) the daughters H1323 of the land H0776.
034:002 And when Shechem H7927 the son H1121 of Hamor H2544 the Hivite H2340, prince H5387 of the country H0776, saw H7200 (8799) her, he took H3947 (8799) her, and lay H7901 (8799) with her, and defiled her H6031 (8762).
034:003 And his soul H5315 clave H1692 (8799) unto Dinah H1783 the daughter H1323 of Jacob H3290, and he loved H0157 (8799) the damsel H5291, and spake H1696 (8762) kindly H3820 unto the damsel H5291.
034:004 And Shechem H7927 spake H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001 Hamor H2544, saying H0559 (8800), Get H3947 (8798) me this damsel H3207 to wife H0802.
034:005 And Jacob H3290 heard H8085 (8804) that he had defiled H2930 (8765) Dinah H1783 his daughter H1323: now his sons H1121 were with his cattle H4735 in the field H7704: and Jacob H3290 held his peace H2790 (8689) until they were come H0935 (8800).
034:006 And Hamor H2544 the father H0001 of Shechem H7927 went out H3318 (8799) unto Jacob H3290 to commune H1696 (8763) with H0854 him.
034:007 And the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8804) out of the field H7704 when they heard H8085 (8800) [it]: and the men H0582 were grieved H6087 (8691), and they were very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799), because he had wrought H6213 (8804) folly H5039 in Israel H3478 in lying H7901 (8800) with Jacob’s H3290 daughter H1323; which thing ought not to be done H6213 (8735).
034:008 And Hamor H2544 communed H1696 (8762) with them, saying H0559 (8800), The soul H5315 of my son H1121 Shechem H7927 longeth H2836 (8804) for your daughter H1323: I pray you give H5414 (8798) her him to wife H0802.
034:009 And make ye marriages H2859 (8690) with us, [and] give H5414 (8799) your daughters H1323 unto us, and take H3947 (8799) our daughters H1323 unto you.
034:010 And ye shall dwell H3427 (8799) with us: and the land H0776 shall be H1961 (8799) before you H6440; dwell H3427 (8798) and trade H5503 (8804) ye therein, and get you possessions H0270 (8734) therein.
034:011 And Shechem H7927 said H0559 (8799) unto her father H0001 and unto her brethren H0251, Let me find H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in your eyes H5869, and what ye shall say H0559 (8799) unto me I will give H5414 (8799).
034:012 Ask H7235 (8685) me never so much H3966 dowry H4119 and gift H4976, and I will give H5414 (8799) according as ye shall say H0559 (8799) unto me: but give H5414 (8798) me the damsel H5291 to wife H0802.
034:013 And the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290 answered H6030 (8799) Shechem H7927 and Hamor H2544 his father H0001 deceitfully H4820, and said H1696 (8762), because he had defiled H2930 (8765) Dinah H1783 their sister H0269:
034:014 And they said H0559 (8799) unto them, We cannot H3808 H3201 (8799) do H6213 (8800) this thing H1697, to give H5414 (8800) our sister H0269 to one H0376 that is uncircumcised H6190; for that [were] a reproach H2781 unto us:
034:015 But in this H2063 will we consent H0225 (8735) unto you: If ye will be as we [be], that every male H2145 of you be circumcised H4135 (8736);
034:016 Then will we give H5414 (8804) our daughters H1323 unto you, and we will take H3947 (8799) your daughters H1323 to us, and we will dwell H3427 (8804) with you, and we will become one H0259 people H5971.
034:017 But if ye will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto us, to be circumcised H4135 (8736); then will we take H3947 (8804) our daughter H1323, and we will be gone H1980 (8804).
034:018 And their words H1697 pleased H3190 (8799) H5869 Hamor H2544, and Shechem H7927 Hamor’s H2544 son H1121.
034:019 And the young man H5288 deferred H0309 (8765) not to do H6213 (8800) the thing H1697, because he had delight H2654 (8804) in Jacob’s H3290 daughter H1323: and he [was] more honourable H3513 (8737) than all the house H1004 of his father H0001.
034:020 And Hamor H2544 and Shechem H7927 his son H1121 came H0935 (8799) unto the gate H8179 of their city H5892, and communed H1696 (8762) with the men H0582 of their city H5892, saying H0559 (8800),
034:021 These men H0582 [are] peaceable H8003 with H0854 us; therefore let them dwell H3427 (8799) in the land H0776, and trade H5503 (8799) therein; for the land H0776, behold, [it is] large H7342 enough H3027 for them H6440; let us take H3947 (8799) their daughters H1323 to us for wives H0802, and let us give H5414 (8799) them our daughters H1323.
034:022 Only herein H2063 will the men H0582 consent H0225 (8735) unto us for to dwell H3427 (8800) with us, to be one H0259 people H5971, if every male H2145 among us be circumcised H4135 (8736), as they [are] circumcised H4135 (8737).
034:023 [Shall] not their cattle H4735 and their substance H7075 and every beast H0929 of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent H0225 (8735) unto them, and they will dwell H3427 (8799) with us.
034:024 And unto Hamor H2544 and unto Shechem H7927 his son H1121 hearkened H8085 (8799) all that went out H3318 (8802) of the gate H8179 of his city H5892; and every male H2145 was circumcised H4135 (8735), all that went out H3318 (8802) of the gate H8179 of his city H5892.
034:025 And it came to pass on the third H7992 day H3117, when they were sore H3510 (8802), that two H8147 of the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290, Simeon H8095 and Levi H3878, Dinah’s H1783 brethren H0251, took H3947 (8799) each man H0376 his sword H2719, and came H0935 (8799) upon the city H5892 boldly H0983, and slew H2026 (8799) all the males H2145.
034:026 And they slew H2026 (8804) Hamor H2544 and Shechem H7927 his son H1121 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and took H3947 Dinah H1783 out H3947 (8799) of Shechem’s H7927 house H1004, and went out H3318 (8799).
034:027 The sons H1121 of Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8804) upon the slain H2491, and spoiled H0962 (8799) the city H5892, because they had defiled H2930 (8765) their sister H0269.
034:028 They took H3947 (8804) their sheep H6629, and their oxen H1241, and their asses H2543, and that which [was] in the city H5892, and that which [was] in the field H7704,
034:029 And all their wealth H2428, and all their little ones H2945, and their wives H0802 took they captive H7617 (8804), and spoiled H0962 (8799) even all that [was] in the house H1004.
034:030 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) to Simeon H8095 and Levi H3878, Ye have troubled H5916 (8804) me to make me to stink H0887 (8687) among the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776, among the Canaanites H3669 and the Perizzites H6522: and I [being] few H4962 in number H4557, they shall gather themselves together H0622 (8738) against me, and slay me H5221 (8689); and I shall be destroyed H8045 (8738), I and my house H1004.
034:031 And they said H0559 (8799), Should he deal H6213 (8799) with our sister H0269 as with an harlot H2181 (8802)?
035:001 ¶ And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, Arise H6965 (8798), go up H5927 (8798) to Bethel H1008, and dwell H3427 (8798) there: and make H6213 (8798) there an altar H4196 unto God H0410, that appeared H7200 (8737) unto thee when thou fleddest H1272 (8800) from the face H6440 of Esau H6215 thy brother H0251.
035:002 Then Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto his household H1004, and to all that [were] with him, Put away H5493 (8685) the strange H5236 gods H0430 that [are] among you H8432, and be clean H2891 (8690), and change H2498 (8685) your garments H8071:
035:003 And let us arise H6965 (8799), and go up H5927 (8799) to Bethel H1008; and I will make H6213 (8799) there an altar H4196 unto God H0410, who answered H6030 (8802) me in the day H3117 of my distress H6869, and was with me in the way H1870 which I went H1980 (8804).
035:004 And they gave H5414 (8799) unto Jacob H3290 all the strange H5236 gods H0430 which [were] in their hand H3027, and [all their] earrings H5141 which [were] in their ears H0241; and Jacob H3290 hid H2934 (8799) them under the oak H0424 which [was] by Shechem H7927.
035:005 And they journeyed H5265 (8799): and the terror H2847 of God H0430 was upon the cities H5892 that [were] round about H5439 them, and they did not pursue H7291 (8804) after H0310 the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290.
035:006 So Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8799) to Luz H3870, which [is] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, that [is], Bethel H1008, he and all the people H5971 that [were] with him.
035:007 And he built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196, and called H7121 (8799) the place H4725 Elbethel H0416: because there God H0430 appeared H1540 (8738) unto him, when he fled H1272 (8800) from the face H6440 of his brother H0251.
035:008 But Deborah H1683 Rebekah’s H7259 nurse H3243 (8688) died H4191 (8799), and she was buried H6912 (8735) beneath Bethel H1008 under an oak H0437: and the name H8034 of it was called H7121 (8799) Allonbachuth H0439.
035:009 And God H0430 appeared H7200 (8735) unto Jacob H3290 again, when he came H0935 (8800) out of Padanaram H6307, and blessed H1288 (8762) him.
035:010 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thy name H8034 [is] Jacob H3290: thy name H8034 shall not be called H7121 (8735) any more Jacob H3290, but Israel H3478 shall be thy name H8034: and he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Israel H3478.
035:011 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto him, I [am] God H0410 Almighty H7706: be fruitful H6509 (8798) and multiply H7235 (8798); a nation H1471 and a company H6951 of nations H1471 shall be of thee, and kings H4428 shall come H3318 (8799) out of thy loins H2504;
035:012 And the land H0776 which I gave H5414 (8804) Abraham H0085 and Isaac H3327, to thee I will give it H5414 (8799), and to thy seed H2233 after thee H0310 will I give H5414 (8799) the land H0776.
035:013 And God H0430 went up H5927 (8799) from him in the place H4725 where he talked H1696 (8765) with him.
035:014 And Jacob H3290 set up H5324 (8686) a pillar H4676 in the place H4725 where he talked H1696 (8765) with him, [even] a pillar H4678 of stone H0068: and he poured H5258 (8686) a drink offering H5262 thereon, and he poured H3332 (8799) oil H8081 thereon.
035:015 And Jacob H3290 called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the place H4725 where God H0430 spake H1696 (8765) with him, Bethel H1008.
035:016 And they journeyed H5265 (8799) from Bethel H1008; and there was but H5750 a little H3530 way H0776 to come H0935 (8800) to Ephrath H0672: and Rachel H7354 travailed H3205 (8799), and she had hard H7185 (8762) labour H3205 (8800).
035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard H7185 (8687) labour H3205 (8800), that the midwife H3205 (8764) said H0559 (8799) unto her, Fear H3372 (8799) not; thou shalt have this son H1121 also.
035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul H5315 was in departing H3318 (8800), (for she died H4191 (8804) ) that she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Benoni H1126: but his father H0001 called H7121 (8804) him Benjamin H1144.
035:019 And Rachel H7354 died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in the way H1870 to Ephrath H0672, which [is] Bethlehem H1035.
035:020 And Jacob H3290 set H5324 (8686) a pillar H4676 upon her grave H6900: that [is] the pillar H4678 of Rachel’s H7354 grave H6900 unto this day H3117.
035:021 And Israel H3478 journeyed H5265 (8799), and spread H5186 (8799) his tent H0168 beyond H1973 the tower H4026 of Edar H4029.
035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel H3478 dwelt H7931 (8800) in that land H0776, that Reuben H7205 went H3212 (8799) and lay H7901 (8799) with Bilhah H1090 his father’s H0001 concubine H6370: and Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8799) [it]. Now the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290 were twelve H8147 H6240:
035:023 The sons H1121 of Leah H3812; Reuben H7205, Jacob’s H3290 firstborn H1060, and Simeon H8095, and Levi H3878, and Judah H3063, and Issachar H3485, and Zebulun H2074:
035:024 The sons H1121 of Rachel H7354; Joseph H3130, and Benjamin H1144:
035:025 And the sons H1121 of Bilhah H1090, Rachel’s H7354 handmaid H8198; Dan H1835, and Naphtali H5321:
035:026 And the sons H1121 of Zilpah H2153, Leah’s H3812 handmaid H8198; Gad H1410, and Asher H0836: these [are] the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290, which were born H3205 (8795) to him in Padanaram H6307.
035:027 And Jacob H3290 came H0935 (8799) unto Isaac H3327 his father H0001 unto Mamre H4471, unto the city of Arbah H7153, which [is] Hebron H2275, where Abraham H0085 and Isaac H3327 sojourned H1481 (8804).
035:028 And the days H3117 of Isaac H3327 were an hundred H3967 H8141 and fourscore H8084 years H8141.
035:029 And Isaac H3327 gave up the ghost H1478 (8799), and died H4191 (8799), and was gathered H0622 (8735) unto his people H5971, [being] old H2205 and full H7649 of days H3117: and his sons H1121 Esau H6215 and Jacob H3290 buried H6912 (8799) him.
036:001 ¶ Now these [are] the generations H8435 of Esau H6215, who [is] Edom H0123.
036:002 Esau H6215 took H3947 (8804) his wives H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Canaan H3667; Adah H5711 the daughter H1323 of Elon H0356 the Hittite H2850, and Aholibamah H0173 the daughter H1323 of Anah H6034 the daughter H1323 of Zibeon H6649 the Hivite H2340;
036:003 And Bashemath H1315 Ishmael’s H3458 daughter H1323, sister H0269 of Nebajoth H5032.
036:004 And Adah H5711 bare H3205 (8799) to Esau H6215 Eliphaz H0464; and Bashemath H1315 bare H3205 (8804) Reuel H7467;
036:005 And Aholibamah H0173 bare H3205 (8804) Jeush H3274, and Jaalam H3281, and Korah H7141: these [are] the sons H1121 of Esau H6215, which were born H3205 (8795) unto him in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
036:006 And Esau H6215 took H3947 (8799) his wives H0802, and his sons H1121, and his daughters H1323, and all the persons H5315 of his house H1004, and his cattle H4735, and all his beasts H0929, and all his substance H7075, which he had got H7408 (8804) in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; and went H3212 (8799) into the country H0776 from the face H6440 of his brother H0251 Jacob H3290.
036:007 For their riches H7399 were more H7227 than that they might dwell H3427 (8800) together H3162; and the land H0776 wherein they were strangers H4033 could H3201 (8804) not bear H5375 (8800) them because H6440 of their cattle H4735.
036:008 Thus dwelt H3427 (8799) Esau H6215 in mount H2022 Seir H8165: Esau H6215 [is] Edom H0123.
036:009 And these [are] the generations H8435 of Esau H6215 the father H0001 of the Edomites H0123 in mount H2022 Seir H8165:

036:012 And Timna H8555 was concubine H6370 to Eliphaz H0464 Esau’s H6215 son H1121; and she bare H3205 (8799) to Eliphaz H0464 Amalek H6002: these [were] the sons H1121 of Adah H5711 Esau’s H6215 wife H0802.

036:015 These [were] dukes H0441 of the sons H1121 of Esau H6215: the sons H1121 of Eliphaz H0464 the firstborn H1060 [son] of Esau H6215; duke H0441 Teman H8487, duke H0441 Omar H0201, duke H0441 Zepho H6825, duke H0441 Kenaz H7073,

037:001 ¶ And Jacob H3290 dwelt H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 wherein his father H0001 was a stranger H4033, in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
037:002 These [are] the generations H8435 of Jacob H3290. Joseph H3130, [being] seventeen H6240 H7651 years H8141 old H1121, was feeding H7462 (8802) the flock H6629 with his brethren H0251; and the lad H5288 [was] with the sons H1121 of Bilhah H1090, and with the sons H1121 of Zilpah H2153, his father’s H0001 wives H0802: and Joseph H3130 brought H0935 (8686) unto his father H0001 their evil H7451 report H1681.
037:003 Now Israel H3478 loved H0157 (8804) Joseph H3130 more than all his children H1121, because he [was] the son H1121 of his old age H2208: and he made H6213 (8804) him a coat H3801 of [many] colours H6446.
037:004 And when his brethren H0251 saw H7200 (8799) that their father H0001 loved H0157 (8804) him more than all his brethren H0251, they hated H8130 (8799) him, and could H3201 (8804) not speak H1696 (8763) peaceably H7965 unto him.
037:005 And Joseph H3130 dreamed H2492 (8799) a dream H2472, and he told H5046 (8686) [it] his brethren H0251: and they hated H8130 (8800) him yet the more H3254 (8686).
037:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798), I pray you, this dream H2472 which I have dreamed H2492 (8804):
037:007 For, behold, we [were] binding H0481 (8764) H8432 sheaves H0485 in the field H7704, and, lo, my sheaf H0485 arose H6965 (8804), and also stood upright H5324 (8738); and, behold, your sheaves H0485 stood round about H5437 (8799), and made obeisance H7812 (8691) to my sheaf H0485.
037:008 And his brethren H0251 said H0559 (8799) to him, Shalt thou indeed H4427 (8800) reign H4427 (8799) over us? or shalt thou indeed H4910 (8800) have dominion H4910 (8799) over us? And they hated H8130 (8800) him yet the more H3254 (8686) for his dreams H2472, and for his words H1697.
037:009 And he dreamed H2492 (8799) yet another H0312 dream H2472, and told H5608 (8762) it his brethren H0251, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I have dreamed H2492 (8804) a dream H2472 more; and, behold, the sun H8121 and the moon H3394 and the eleven H6240 H0259 stars H3556 made obeisance H7812 (8693) to me.
037:010 And he told H5608 (8762) [it] to his father H0001, and to his brethren H0251: and his father H0001 rebuked H1605 (8799) him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, What [is] this dream H2472 that thou hast dreamed H2492 (8804)? Shall I and thy mother H0517 and thy brethren H0251 indeed H0935 (8800) come H0935 (8799) to bow down H7812 (8692) ourselves to thee to the earth H0776?
037:011 And his brethren H0251 envied H7065 (8762) him; but his father H0001 observed H8104 (8804) the saying H1697.
037:012 And his brethren H0251 went H3212 (8799) to feed H7462 (8800) their father’s H0001 flock H6629 in Shechem H7927.
037:013 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Do not thy brethren H0251 feed H7462 (8802) [the flock] in Shechem H7927? come H3212 (8798), and I will send thee H7971 (8799) unto them. And he said H0559 (8799) to him, Here [am I].
037:014 And he said H0559 (8799) to him, Go H3212 (8798), I pray thee, see H7200 (8798) whether it be well H7965 with thy brethren H0251, and well H7965 with the flocks H6629; and bring H7725 me word H1697 again H7725 (8685). So he sent H7971 (8799) him out of the vale H6010 of Hebron H2275, and he came H0935 (8799) to Shechem H7927.
037:015 And a certain man H0376 found him H4672 (8799), and, behold, [he was] wandering H8582 (8802) in the field H7704: and the man H0376 asked him H7592 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), What seekest H1245 (8762) thou?
037:016 And he said H0559 (8799), I seek H1245 (8764) my brethren H0251: tell H5046 (8685) me, I pray thee, where H0375 they feed H7462 (8802) [their flocks].
037:017 And the man H0376 said H0559 (8799), They are departed H5265 (8804) hence H2088; for I heard H8085 (8804) them say H0559 (8802), Let us go H3212 (8799) to Dothan H1886. And Joseph H3130 went H3212 (8799) after H0310 his brethren H0251, and found H4672 (8799) them in Dothan H1886.
037:018 And when they saw H7200 (8799) him afar off H7350, even before he came near H7126 (8799) unto them, they conspired H5230 (8691) against him to slay H4191 (8687) him.
037:019 And they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H0251, Behold, this H1976 dreamer H1167 H2472 cometh H0935 (8802).
037:020 Come H3212 (8798) now therefore, and let us slay H2026 (8799) him, and cast H7993 (8686) him into some H0259 pit H0953, and we will say H0559 (8804), Some evil H7451 beast H2416 hath devoured H0398 (8804) him: and we shall see H7200 (8799) what will become of his dreams H2472.
037:021 And Reuben H7205 heard H8085 (8799) [it], and he delivered H5337 (8686) him out of their hands H3027; and said H0559 (8799), Let us not kill H5221 (8686) H5315 him.
037:022 And Reuben H7205 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Shed H8210 (8799) no blood H1818, [but] cast H7993 (8685) him into this pit H0953 that [is] in the wilderness H4057, and lay H7971 (8799) no hand H3027 upon him; that he might rid H5337 (8687) him out of their hands H3027, to deliver H7725 him to his father H0001 again H7725 (8687).
037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph H3130 was come H0935 (8804) unto his brethren H0251, that they stript H6584 (8686) H0853 Joseph H3130 out of H0854 his coat H3801, [his] coat H3801 of [many] colours H6446 that [was] on him;
037:024 And they took H3947 (8799) him, and cast H7993 (8686) him into a pit H0953: and the pit H0953 [was] empty H7386, [there was] no water H4325 in it.
037:025 And they sat down H3427 (8799) to eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899: and they lifted up H5375 (8799) their eyes H5869 and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, a company H0736 of Ishmeelites H3459 came H0935 (8802) from Gilead H1568 with their camels H1581 bearing H5375 (8802) spicery H5219 and balm H6875 and myrrh H3910, going H1980 (8802) to carry [it] down H3381 (8687) to Egypt H4714.
037:026 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, What profit H1215 [is it] if we slay H2026 (8799) our brother H0251, and conceal H3680 (8765) his blood H1818?
037:027 Come H3212 (8798), and let us sell H4376 (8799) him to the Ishmeelites H3459, and let not our hand H3027 be upon him; for he [is] our brother H0251 [and] our flesh H1320. And his brethren H0251 were content H8085 (8799).
037:028 Then there passed H5674 (8799) by Midianites H4084 merchantmen H0582 H5503 (8802); and they drew H4900 (8799) and lifted up H5927 (8686) Joseph H3130 out of the pit H0953, and sold H4376 (8799) Joseph H3130 to the Ishmeelites H3459 for twenty H6242 [pieces] of silver H3701: and they brought H0935 (8686) Joseph H3130 into Egypt H4714.
037:029 And Reuben H7205 returned H7725 (8799) unto the pit H0953; and, behold, Joseph H3130 [was] not in the pit H0953; and he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899.
037:030 And he returned H7725 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, and said H0559 (8799), The child H3206 [is] not; and I, whither H0575 shall I go H0935 (8802)?
037:031 And they took H3947 (8799) Joseph’s H3130 coat H3801, and killed H7819 (8799) a kid H8163 of the goats H5795, and dipped H2881 (8799) the coat H3801 in the blood H1818;
037:032 And they sent H7971 (8762) the coat H3801 of [many] colours H6446, and they brought H0935 (8686) [it] to their father H0001; and said H0559 (8799), This have we found H4672 (8804): know H5234 (8685) now whether it [be] thy son’s H1121 coat H3801 or no.
037:033 And he knew it H5234 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), [It is] my son’s H1121 coat H3801; an evil H7451 beast H2416 hath devoured H0398 (8804) him; Joseph H3130 is without doubt H2963 (8800) rent in pieces H2963 (8776).
037:034 And Jacob H3290 rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H8071, and put H7760 (8799) sackcloth H8242 upon his loins H4975, and mourned H0056 (8691) for his son H1121 many H7227 days H3117.
037:035 And all his sons H1121 and all his daughters H1323 rose up H6965 (8799) to comfort H5162 (8763) him; but he refused H3985 (8762) to be comforted H5162 (8692); and he said H0559 (8799), For I will go down H3381 (8799) into the grave H7585 unto my son H1121 mourning H0057. Thus his father H0001 wept H1058 (8799) for him.
037:036 And the Midianites H4092 sold H4376 (8804) him into Egypt H4714 unto Potiphar H6318, an officer H5631 of Pharaoh’s H6547, [and] captain H8269 of the guard H2876.
038:001 ¶ And it came to pass at that time H6256, that Judah H3063 went down H3381 (8799) from his brethren H0251, and turned H5186 (8799) in to a certain H0376 Adullamite H5726, whose name H8034 [was] Hirah H2437.
038:002 And Judah H3063 saw H7200 (8799) there a daughter H1323 of a certain H0376 Canaanite H3669, whose name H8034 [was] Shuah H7770; and he took her H3947 (8799), and went in H0935 (8799) unto her.
038:003 And she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and he called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Er H6147.
038:004 And she conceived H2029 (8799) again, and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and she called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Onan H0209.
038:005 And she yet again conceived H3254 (8686), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121; and called H7121 (8799) his name H8034 Shelah H7956: and he was at Chezib H3580, when she bare H3205 (8800) him.
038:006 And Judah H3063 took H3947 (8799) a wife H0802 for Er H6147 his firstborn H1060, whose name H8034 [was] Tamar H8559.
038:007 And Er H6147, Judah’s H3063 firstborn H1060, was wicked H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068; and the LORD H3068 slew H4191 (8686) him.
038:008 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799) unto Onan H0209, Go in H0935 (8798) unto thy brother’s H0251 wife H0802, and marry H2992 (8761) her, and raise up H6965 (8685) seed H2233 to thy brother H0251.
038:009 And Onan H0209 knew H3045 (8799) that the seed H2233 should not be his; and it came to pass, when H0518 he went in H0935 (8802) unto his brother’s H0251 wife H0802, that he spilled H7843 (8765) [it] on the ground H0776, lest H1115 that he should give H5414 (8800) seed H2233 to his brother H0251.
038:010 And the thing which H0834 he did H6213 (8804) displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 the LORD H3068: wherefore he slew H4191 (8686) him also.
038:011 Then said H0559 (8799) Judah H3063 to Tamar H8559 his daughter in law H3618, Remain H3427 (8798) a widow H0490 at thy father’s H0001 house H1004, till Shelah H7956 my son H1121 be grown H1431 (8799): for he said H0559 (8804), Lest peradventure he die H4191 (8799) also, as his brethren H0251 [did]. And Tamar H8559 went H3212 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in her father’s H0001 house H1004.
038:012 And in process H7235 (8799) of time H3117 the daughter H1323 of Shuah H7770 Judah’s H3063 wife H0802 died H4191 (8799); and Judah H3063 was comforted H5162 (8735), and went up H5927 (8799) unto his sheepshearers H1494 (8802) H6629 to Timnath H8553, he and his friend H7453 Hirah H2437 the Adullamite H5726.
038:013 And it was told H5046 (8714) Tamar H8559, saying H0559 (8800), Behold thy father in law H2524 goeth up H5927 (8802) to Timnath H8553 to shear H1494 (8800) his sheep H6629.
038:014 And she put H5493 her widow’s H0491 garments H0899 off H5493 (8686) from her, and covered her H3680 (8762) with a vail H6809, and wrapped herself H5968 (8691), and sat in H3427 (8799) an open H5869 place H6607, which [is] by the way H1870 to Timnath H8553; for she saw H7200 (8804) that Shelah H7956 was grown H1431 (8804), and she was not given H5414 (8738) unto him to wife H0802.
038:015 When Judah H3063 saw her H7200 (8799), he thought H2803 (8799) her [to be] an harlot H2181 (8802); because she had covered H3680 (8765) her face H6440.
038:016 And he turned H5186 (8799) unto her by the way H1870, and said H0559 (8799), Go to H3051 (8798), I pray thee, let me come in H0935 (8799) unto thee; (for he knew H3045 (8804) not that she [was] his daughter in law H3618.) And she said H0559 (8799), What wilt thou give H5414 (8799) me, that thou mayest come in H0935 (8799) unto me?
038:017 And he said H0559 (8799), I will send H7971 (8762) [thee] a kid H5795 H1423 from the flock H6629. And she said H0559 (8799), Wilt thou give H5414 (8799) [me] a pledge H6162, till thou send H7971 (8800) [it]?
038:018 And he said H0559 (8799), What H0834 pledge H6162 shall I give H5414 (8799) thee? And she said H0559 (8799), Thy signet H2368, and thy bracelets H6616, and thy staff H4294 that [is] in thine hand H3027. And he gave H5414 (8799) [it] her, and came in H0935 (8799) unto her, and she conceived H2029 (8799) by him.
038:019 And she arose H6965 (8799), and went away H3212 (8799), and laid by H5493 (8686) her vail H6809 from her, and put on H3847 (8799) the garments H0899 of her widowhood H0491.
038:020 And Judah H3063 sent H7971 (8799) the kid H1423 H5795 by the hand H3027 of his friend H7453 the Adullamite H5726, to receive H3947 (8800) [his] pledge H6162 from the woman’s H0802 hand H3027: but he found her H4672 (8804) not.
038:021 Then he asked H7592 (8799) the men H0582 of that place H4725, saying H0559 (8800), Where [is] the harlot H6948, that [was] openly H5869 by the way side H1870? And they said H0559 (8799), There was no harlot H6948 in this H2088 [place].
038:022 And he returned H7725 (8799) to Judah H3063, and said H0559 (8799), I cannot H3808 find H4672 (8804) her; and also the men H0582 of the place H4725 said H0559 (8804), [that] there was no harlot H6948 in this [place].
038:023 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799), Let her take H3947 (8799) [it] to her, lest we be shamed H0937: behold, I sent H7971 (8804) this kid H1423, and thou hast not found H4672 (8804) her.
038:024 And it came to pass about three H7969 months H2320 after, that it was told H5046 (8714) Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), Tamar H8559 thy daughter in law H3618 hath played the harlot H2181 (8804); and also, behold, she [is] with child H2030 by whoredom H2183. And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799), Bring her forth H3318 (8685), and let her be burnt H8313 (8735).
038:025 When she [was] brought forth H3318 (8716), she sent H7971 (8804) to her father in law H2524, saying H0559 (8800), By the man H0376, whose these [are, am] I with child H2030: and she said H0559 (8799), Discern H5234 (8685), I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet H2858, and bracelets H6616, and staff H4294.
038:026 And Judah H3063 acknowledged H5234 (8686) [them], and said H0559 (8799), She hath been more righteous H6663 (8804) than I; because that I gave H5414 (8804) her not to Shelah H7956 my son H1121. And he knew her H3045 (8800) again H3254 (8804) no more.
038:027 And it came to pass in the time H6256 of her travail H3205 (8800), that, behold, twins H8380 [were] in her womb H0990.
038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed H3205 (8800), that [the one] put out H5414 (8799) [his] hand H3027: and the midwife H3205 (8764) took H3947 (8799) and bound H7194 (8799) upon his hand H3027 a scarlet thread H8144, saying H0559 (8800), This came out H3318 (8804) first H7223.
038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back H7725 (8688) his hand H3027, that, behold, his brother H0251 came out H3318 (8804): and she said H0559 (8799), How hast thou broken forth H6555 (8804)? [this] breach H6556 [be] upon thee: therefore his name H8034 was called H7121 (8799) Pharez H6557.
038:030 And afterward H0310 came out H3318 (8804) his brother H0251, that had the scarlet thread H8144 upon his hand H3027: and his name H8034 was called H7121 (8799) Zarah H2226.
039:001 ¶ And Joseph H3130 was brought down H3381 (8717) to Egypt H4714; and Potiphar H6318, an officer H5631 of Pharaoh H6547, captain H8269 of the guard H2876, an Egyptian H0376 H4713, bought H7069 (8799) him of the hands H3027 of the Ishmeelites H3459, which had brought him down H3381 (8689) thither.
039:002 And the LORD H3068 was with Joseph H3130, and he was a prosperous H6743 (8688) man H0376; and he was in the house H1004 of his master H0113 the Egyptian H4713.
039:003 And his master H0113 saw H7200 (8799) that the LORD H3068 [was] with him, and that the LORD H3068 made all that he did H6213 (8802) to prosper H6743 (8688) in his hand H3027.
039:004 And Joseph H3130 found H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in his sight H5869, and he served H8334 (8762) him: and he made him overseer H6485 (8686) over his house H1004, and all [that] he had H3426 he put H5414 (8804) into his hand H3027.
039:005 And it came to pass from the time H0227 [that] he had made him overseer H6485 (8689) in his house H1004, and over all that he had H3426, that the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8762) the Egyptian’s H4713 house H1004 for Joseph’s H3130 sake H1558; and the blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068 was upon all that he had H3426 in the house H1004, and in the field H7704.
039:006 And he left H5800 (8799) all that he had in Joseph’s H3130 hand H3027; and he knew H3045 (8804) not ought H3972 he had, save H0518 the bread H3899 which he did eat H0398 (8802). And Joseph H3130 was [a] goodly H8389 [person], and well H3303 favoured H4758.
039:007 And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, that his master’s H0113 wife H0802 cast H5375 (8799) her eyes H5869 upon Joseph H3130; and she said H0559 (8799), Lie H7901 (8798) with me.
039:008 But he refused H3985 (8762), and said H0559 (8799) unto his master’s H0113 wife H0802, Behold, my master H0113 wotteth H3045 (8804) not what [is] with me in the house H1004, and he hath committed H5414 (8804) all that he hath H3426 to my hand H3027;
039:009 [There is] none greater H1419 in this house H1004 than I; neither H3808 hath he kept back H2820 (8804) any thing H3972 from me but thee, because H0834 thou H0859 [art] his wife H0802: how then can I do H6213 (8799) this great H1419 wickedness H7451, and sin H2398 (8804) against God H0430?
039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake H1696 (8763) to Joseph H3130 day H3117 by day H3117, that he hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto her, to lie H7901 (8800) by her H0681, [or] to be with her.
039:011 And it came to pass about this time H3117, that [Joseph] went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 to do H6213 (8800) his business H4399; and [there was] none of the men H0376 H0582 of the house H1004 there within.
039:012 And she caught H8610 (8799) him by his garment H0899, saying H0559 (8800), Lie H7901 (8798) with me: and he left H5800 (8799) his garment H0899 in her hand H3027, and fled H5127 (8799), and got H3318 (8799) him out H2351.
039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw H7200 (8800) that he had left H5800 (8804) his garment H0899 in her hand H3027, and was fled H5127 (8799) forth H2351,
039:014 That she called H7121 (8799) unto the men H0582 of her house H1004, and spake H0559 (8799) unto them, saying H0559 (8800), See H7200 (8798), he hath brought in H0935 (8689) an Hebrew H0376 H5680 unto us to mock H6711 (8763) us; he came in H0935 (8804) unto me to lie H7901 (8800) with me, and I cried H7121 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963:
039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard H8085 (8800) that I lifted up H7311 (8689) my voice H6963 and cried H7121 (8799), that he left H5800 (8799) his garment H0899 with me H0681, and fled H5127 (8799), and got him H3318 (8799) out H2351.
039:016 And she laid up H3240 (8686) his garment H0899 by her H0681, until his lord H0113 came H0935 (8800) home H1004.
039:017 And she spake H1696 (8762) unto him according to these words H1697, saying H0559 (8800), The Hebrew H5680 servant H5650, which thou hast brought H0935 (8689) unto us, came in H0935 (8804) unto me to mock H6711 (8763) me:
039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up H7311 (8687) my voice H6963 and cried H7121 (8799), that he left H5800 (8799) his garment H0899 with me H0681, and fled H5127 (8799) out H2351.
039:019 And it came to pass, when his master H0113 heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of his wife H0802, which she spake H1696 (8765) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), After this manner H1697 did H6213 (8804) thy servant H5650 to me; that his wrath H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799).
039:020 And Joseph’s H3130 master H0113 took H3947 (8799) him, and put him H5414 (8799) into the prison H1004 H5470, a place H4725 where the king’s H4428 prisoners H0615 [were] bound H0631 (8803): and he was there in the prison H1004 H5470.
039:021 But the LORD H3068 was with Joseph H3130, and shewed H5186 (8799) him mercy H2617, and gave H5414 (8799) him favour H2580 in the sight H5869 of the keeper H8269 of the prison H1004 H5470.
039:022 And the keeper H8269 of the prison H1004 H5470 committed H5414 (8799) to Joseph’s H3130 hand H3027 all the prisoners H0615 that [were] in the prison H1004 H5470; and whatsoever they did H6213 (8802) there, he was the doer H6213 (8802) [of it].
039:023 The keeper H8269 of the prison H1004 H5470 looked H7200 (8802) not to any thing H3972 [that was] under his hand H3027; because the LORD H3068 was with him, and [that] which he did H6213 (8802), the LORD H3068 made [it] to prosper H6743 (8688).
040:001 ¶ And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, [that] the butler H8248 (8688) of the king H4428 of Egypt H4714 and [his] baker H0644 (8802) had offended H2398 (8804) their lord H0113 the king H4428 of Egypt H4714.
040:002 And Pharaoh H6547 was wroth H7107 (8799) against H5921 two H8147 [of] his officers H5631, against the chief H8269 of the butlers H8248 (8688), and against the chief H8269 of the bakers H0644 (8802).
040:003 And he put H5414 (8799) them in ward H4929 in the house H1004 of the captain H8269 of the guard H2876, into the prison H1004 H5470, the place H4725 where Joseph H3130 [was] bound H0631 (8803).
040:004 And the captain H8269 of the guard H2876 charged H6485 (8799) Joseph H3130 with them, and he served H8334 (8762) them: and they continued a season H3117 in ward H4929.
040:005 And they dreamed H2492 (8799) a dream H2472 both of them H8147, each man H0376 his dream H2472 in one H0259 night H3915, each man H0376 according to the interpretation H6623 of his dream H2472, the butler H8248 (8688) and the baker H0644 (8802) of the king H4428 of Egypt H4714, which [were] bound H0631 (8803) in the prison H1004 H5470.
040:006 And Joseph H3130 came in H0935 (8799) unto them in the morning H1242, and looked H7200 (8799) upon them, and, behold, they [were] sad H2196 (8802).
040:007 And he asked H7592 (8799) Pharaoh’s H6547 officers H5631 that [were] with him in the ward H4929 of his lord’s H0113 house H1004, saying H0559 (8800), Wherefore look H6440 ye [so] sadly H7451 to day H3117?
040:008 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, We have dreamed H2492 (8804) a dream H2472, and [there is] no interpreter H6622 (8802) of it. And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto them, [Do] not interpretations H6623 [belong] to God H0430? tell me H5608 (8761) [them], I pray you.
040:009 And the chief H8269 butler H8248 (8688) told H5608 (8762) his dream H2472 to Joseph H3130, and said H0559 (8799) to him, In my dream H2472, behold, a vine H1612 [was] before me H6440;
040:010 And in the vine H1612 [were] three H7969 branches H8299: and it [was] as though it budded H6524 (8802), [and] her blossoms H5322 shot forth H5927 (8804); and the clusters H0811 thereof brought forth ripe H1310 (8689) grapes H6025:
040:011 And Pharaoh’s H6547 cup H3563 [was] in my hand H3027: and I took H3947 (8799) the grapes H6025, and pressed H7818 (8799) them into Pharaoh’s H6547 cup H3563, and I gave H5414 (8799) the cup H3563 into Pharaoh’s H6547 hand H3709.
040:012 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto him, This [is] the interpretation H6623 of it: The three H7969 branches H8299 [are] three H7969 days H3117:
040:013 Yet H5750 within three H7969 days H3117 shall Pharaoh H6547 lift up H5375 (8799) thine head H7218, and restore H7725 (8689) thee unto thy place H3653: and thou shalt deliver H5414 (8804) Pharaoh’s H6547 cup H3563 into his hand H3027, after the former H7223 manner H4941 when thou wast his butler H8248 (8688).
040:014 But think H2142 (8804) on me when it shall be well H3190 (8799) with thee, and shew H6213 (8804) kindness H2617, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention H2142 (8689) of me unto Pharaoh H6547, and bring me H3318 (8689) out of this house H1004:
040:015 For indeed I was stolen away H1589 (8795) out of the land H0776 of the Hebrews H5680: and here also have I done H6213 (8804) nothing H3972 that they should put H7760 (8804) me into the dungeon H0953.
040:016 When the chief H8269 baker H0644 (8802) saw H7200 (8799) that the interpretation H6622 (8804) was good H2896, he said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, I also H0637 [was] in my dream H2472, and, behold, [I had] three H7969 white H2751 baskets H5536 on my head H7218:
040:017 And in the uppermost H5945 basket H5536 [there was] of all manner H3978 of bakemeats H4639 H0644 (8802) for Pharaoh H6547; and the birds H5775 did eat H0398 (8802) them out of the basket H5536 upon H5921 my head H7218.
040:018 And Joseph H3130 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), This [is] the interpretation H6623 thereof: The three H7969 baskets H5536 [are] three H7969 days H3117:
040:019 Yet within three H7969 days H3117 shall Pharaoh H6547 lift up H5375 (8799) thy head H7218 from off thee, and shall hang H8518 (8804) thee on a tree H6086; and the birds H5775 shall eat H0398 (8804) thy flesh H1320 from off thee.
040:020 And it came to pass the third H7992 day H3117, [which was] Pharaoh’s H6547 birthday H3117 H3205 (8715), that he made H6213 (8799) a feast H4960 unto all his servants H5650: and he lifted up H5375 (8799) the head H7218 of the chief H8269 butler H8248 (8688) and of the chief H8269 baker H0644 (8802) among H8432 his servants H5650.
040:021 And he restored H7725 the chief H8269 butler H8248 (8688) unto his butlership H4945 again H7725 (8686); and he gave H5414 (8799) the cup H3563 into Pharaoh’s H6547 hand H3709:
040:022 But he hanged H8518 (8804) the chief H8269 baker H0644 (8802): as Joseph H3130 had interpreted H6622 (8804) to them.
040:023 Yet did not the chief H8269 butler H8248 (8688) remember H2142 (8804) Joseph H3130, but forgat H7911 (8799) him.
041:001 ¶ And it came to pass at the end H7093 of two full H3117 years H8141, that Pharaoh H6547 dreamed H2492 (8802): and, behold, he stood H5975 (8802) by the river H2975.
041:002 And, behold, there came up H5927 (8802) out of the river H2975 seven H7651 well H3303 favoured H4758 kine H6510 and fatfleshed H1277 H1320; and they fed H7462 (8799) in a meadow H0260.
041:003 And, behold, seven H7651 other H0312 kine H6510 came up H5927 (8802) after them H0310 out of the river H2975, ill H7451 favoured H4758 and leanfleshed H1851 H1320; and stood H5975 (8799) by H0681 the [other] kine H6510 upon the brink H8193 of the river H2975.
041:004 And the ill H7451 favoured H4758 and leanfleshed H1851 H1320 kine H6510 did eat up H0398 (8799) the seven H7651 well H3303 favoured H4758 and fat H1277 kine H6510. So Pharaoh H6547 awoke H3364 (8799).
041:005 And he slept H3462 (8799) and dreamed H2492 (8799) the second time H8145: and, behold, seven H7651 ears of corn H7641 came up H5927 (8802) upon one H0259 stalk H7070, rank H1277 and good H2896.
041:006 And, behold, seven H7651 thin H1851 ears H7641 and blasted H7710 (8803) with the east wind H6921 sprung up H6779 (8802) after them H0310.
041:007 And the seven thin H1851 ears H7641 devoured H1104 (8799) the seven H7651 rank H1277 and full H4392 ears H7641. And Pharaoh H6547 awoke H3364 (8799), and, behold, [it was] a dream H2472.
041:008 And it came to pass in the morning H1242 that his spirit H7307 was troubled H6470 (8735); and he sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) for all the magicians H2748 of Egypt H4714, and all the wise men H2450 thereof: and Pharaoh H6547 told H5608 (8762) them his dream H2472; but [there was] none that could interpret H6622 (8802) them unto Pharaoh H6547.
041:009 Then spake H1696 (8762) the chief H8269 butler H8248 (8688) unto Pharaoh H6547, saying H0559 (8800), I do remember H2142 (8688) my faults H2399 this day H3117:
041:010 Pharaoh H6547 was wroth H7107 (8804) with his servants H5650, and put H5414 (8799) me in ward H4929 in the captain H8269 of the guard’s H2876 house H1004, [both] me and the chief H8269 baker H0644 (8802):
041:011 And we dreamed H2492 (8799) a dream H2472 in one H0259 night H3915, I and he; we dreamed H2492 (8804) each man H0376 according to the interpretation H6623 of his dream H2472.
041:012 And [there was] there with us a young man H5288, an Hebrew H5680, servant H5650 to the captain H8269 of the guard H2876; and we told H5608 (8762) him, and he interpreted H6622 (8799) to us our dreams H2472; to each man H0376 according to his dream H2472 he did interpret H6622 (8804).
041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted H6622 (8804) to us, so it was; me he restored H7725 (8689) unto mine office H3653, and him he hanged H8518 (8804).
041:014 Then Pharaoh H6547 sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) Joseph H3130, and they brought him hastily H7323 (8686) out of the dungeon H0953: and he shaved H1548 (8762) [himself], and changed H2498 (8762) his raiment H8071, and came in H0935 (8804) unto Pharaoh H6547.
041:015 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, I have dreamed H2492 (8804) a dream H2472, and [there is] none that can interpret H6622 (8802) it: and I have heard H8085 (8804) say H0559 (8800) of thee, [that] thou canst understand H8085 (8799) a dream H2472 to interpret H6622 (8800) it.
041:016 And Joseph H3130 answered H6030 (8799) Pharaoh H6547, saying H0559 (8800), [It is] not in me H1107: God H0430 shall give H6030 Pharaoh H6547 an answer H6030 (8799) of peace H7965.
041:017 And Pharaoh H6547 said H1696 (8762) unto Joseph H3130, In my dream H2472, behold, I stood H5975 (8802) upon the bank H8193 of the river H2975:
041:018 And, behold, there came up H5927 (8802) out of the river H2975 seven H7651 kine H6510, fatfleshed H1277 H1320 and well H3303 favoured H8389; and they fed H7462 (8799) in a meadow H0260:
041:019 And, behold, seven H7651 other H0312 kine H6510 came up H5927 (8802) after them H0310, poor H1803 and very H3966 ill H7451 favoured H8389 and leanfleshed H7534 H1320, such H2007 as I never H3808 saw H7200 (8804) in all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 for badness H7455:
041:020 And the lean H7534 and the ill favoured H7451 kine H6510 did eat up H0398 (8799) the first H7223 seven H7651 fat H1277 kine H6510:
041:021 And when they had eaten them up H0935 (8799) H7130, it could not be known H3045 (8738) that they had eaten them H0935 (8804) H7130; but they [were] still H4758 ill favoured H7451, as at the beginning H8462. So I awoke H3364 (8799).
041:022 And I saw H7200 (8799) in my dream H2472, and, behold, seven H7651 ears H7641 came up H5927 (8802) in one H0259 stalk H7070, full H4392 and good H2896:
041:023 And, behold, seven H7651 ears H7641, withered H6798 (8803), thin H1851, [and] blasted H7710 (8803) with the east wind H6921, sprung up H6779 (8802) after them H0310:
041:024 And the thin H1851 ears H7641 devoured H1104 (8799) the seven H7651 good H2896 ears H7641: and I told H0559 (8799) [this] unto the magicians H2748; but [there was] none that could declare H5046 (8688) [it] to me.
041:025 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto Pharaoh H6547, The dream H2472 of Pharaoh H6547 [is] one H0259: God H0430 hath shewed H5046 (8689) Pharaoh H6547 what he [is] about to do H6213 (8802).
041:026 The seven H7651 good H2896 kine H6510 [are] seven H7651 years H8141; and the seven H7651 good H2896 ears H7641 [are] seven H7651 years H8141: the dream H2472 [is] one H0259.
041:027 And the seven H7651 thin H7534 and ill favoured H7451 kine H6510 that came up H5927 (8802) after them H0310 [are] seven H7651 years H8141; and the seven H7651 empty H7386 ears H7641 blasted H7710 (8803) with the east wind H6921 shall be seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458.
041:028 This [is] the thing H1697 which I have spoken H1696 (8765) unto Pharaoh H6547: What God H0430 [is] about to do H6213 (8802) he sheweth H7200 (8689) unto Pharaoh H6547.
041:029 Behold, there come H0935 (8802) seven H7651 years H8141 of great H1419 plenty H7647 throughout all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714:
041:030 And there shall arise H6965 (8804) after them H0310 seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458; and all the plenty H7647 shall be forgotten H7911 (8738) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; and the famine H7458 shall consume H3615 (8765) the land H0776;
041:031 And the plenty H7647 shall not be known H3045 (8735) in the land H0776 by reason H6440 of that famine H7458 following H0310 H3651; for it [shall be] very H3966 grievous H3515.
041:032 And for that the dream H2472 was doubled H8138 (8736) unto Pharaoh H6547 twice H6471; [it is] because the thing H1697 [is] established H3559 (8737) by H5973 God H0430, and God H0430 will shortly H4116 (8764) bring it to pass H6213 (8800).
041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh H6547 look out H7200 (8799) a man H0376 discreet H0995 (8737) and wise H2450, and set H7896 (8799) him over the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:034 Let Pharaoh H6547 do H6213 (8799) [this], and let him appoint H6485 (8686) officers H6496 over the land H0776, and take up the fifth part H2567 (8765) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 in the seven H7651 plenteous H7647 years H8141.
041:035 And let them gather H6908 (8799) all the food H0400 of those good H2896 years H8141 that come H0935 (8802), and lay up H6651 (8799) corn H1250 under the hand H3027 of Pharaoh H6547, and let them keep H8104 (8804) food H0400 in the cities H5892.
041:036 And that food H0400 shall be for store H6487 to the land H0776 against the seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458, which shall be in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; that the land H0776 perish H3772 (8735) not through the famine H7458.
041:037 And the thing H1697 was good H3190 (8799) in the eyes H5869 of Pharaoh H6547, and in the eyes H5869 of all his servants H5650.
041:038 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, Can we find H4672 (8799) [such a one] as this H2088 [is], a man H0376 in whom H0834 the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 [is]?
041:039 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Forasmuch H0310 as God H0430 hath shewed H3045 (8687) thee all this, [there is] none so discreet H0995 (8737) and wise H2450 as thou [art]:
041:040 Thou shalt be H1961 (8799) over my house H1004, and according unto thy word H6310 shall all my people H5971 be ruled H5401 (8799): only in the throne H3678 will I be greater H1431 (8799) than thou.
041:041 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, See H7200 (8798), I have set H5414 (8804) thee over all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:042 And Pharaoh H6547 took off H5493 (8686) his ring H2885 from his hand H3027, and put H5414 (8799) it upon Joseph’s H3130 hand H3027, and arrayed H3847 (8686) him in vestures H0899 of fine linen H8336, and put H7760 (8799) a gold H2091 chain H7242 about his neck H6677;
041:043 And he made him to ride H7392 (8686) in the second H4932 chariot H4818 which he had; and they cried H7121 (8799) before him H6440, Bow the knee H0086: and he made H5414 (8800) him [ruler] over all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:044 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, I [am] Pharaoh H6547, and without H1107 thee shall no man H0376 lift up H7311 (8686) his hand H3027 or foot H7272 in all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:045 And Pharaoh H6547 called H7121 (8799) Joseph’s H3130 name H8034 Zaphnathpaaneah H6847; and he gave H5414 (8799) him to wife H0802 Asenath H0621 the daughter H1323 of Potipherah H6319 priest H3548 of On H0204. And Joseph H3130 went out H3318 (8799) over [all] the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:046 And Joseph H3130 [was] thirty H7970 years H8141 old H1121 when he stood H5975 (8800) before H6440 Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714. And Joseph H3130 went out H3318 (8799) from the presence H6440 of Pharaoh H6547, and went throughout H5674 (8799) all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:047 And in the seven H7651 plenteous H7647 years H8141 the earth H0776 brought forth H6213 (8799) by handfuls H7062.
041:048 And he gathered up H6908 (8799) all the food H0400 of the seven H7651 years H8141, which were in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and laid up H5414 (8799) the food H0400 in the cities H5892: the food H0400 of the field H7704, which [was] round about H5439 every city H5892, laid he up H5414 (8804) in the same H8432.
041:049 And Joseph H3130 gathered H6651 (8799) corn H1250 as the sand H2344 of the sea H3220, very H3966 much H7235 (8687), until he left H2308 (8804) numbering H5608 (8800); for [it was] without H0369 number H4557.
041:050 And unto Joseph H3130 were born H3205 (8795) two H8147 sons H1121 before the years H8141 of famine H7458 came H0935 (8799), which Asenath H0621 the daughter H1323 of Potipherah H6319 priest H3548 of On H0204 bare H3205 (8804) unto him.
041:051 And Joseph H3130 called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the firstborn H1060 Manasseh H4519: For God H0430, [said he], hath made me forget H5382 (8765) all my toil H5999, and all my father’s H0001 house H1004.
041:052 And the name H8034 of the second H8145 called H7121 (8804) he Ephraim H0669: For God H0430 hath caused me to be fruitful H6509 (8689) in the land H0776 of my affliction H6040.
041:053 And the seven H7651 years H8141 of plenteousness H7647, that was in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, were ended H3615 (8799).
041:054 And the seven H7651 years H8141 of dearth H7458 began H2490 (8686) to come H0935 (8800), according as Joseph H3130 had said H0559 (8804): and the dearth H7458 was in all lands H0776; but in all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 there was bread H3899.
041:055 And when all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 was famished H7456 (8799), the people H5971 cried H6817 (8799) to Pharaoh H6547 for bread H3899: and Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto all the Egyptians H4714, Go H3212 (8798) unto Joseph H3130; what he saith H0559 (8799) to you, do H6213 (8799).
041:056 And the famine H7458 was over all the face H6440 of the earth H0776: And Joseph H3130 opened H6605 (8799) all the storehouses, and sold H7666 (8799) unto the Egyptians H4714; and the famine H7458 waxed sore H2388 (8799) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
041:057 And all countries H0776 came H0935 (8804) into Egypt H4714 to Joseph H3130 for to buy H7666 (8800) [corn]; because that the famine H7458 was [so] sore H2388 (8804) in all lands H0776.
042:001 ¶ Now when Jacob H3290 saw H7200 (8799) that there was H3426 corn H7668 in Egypt H4714, Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto his sons H1121, Why do ye look H7200 (8691) one upon another?
042:002 And he said H0559 (8799), Behold, I have heard H8085 (8804) that there is H3426 corn H7668 in Egypt H4714: get you down H3381 (8798) thither, and buy H7666 (8798) for us from thence; that we may live H2421 (8799), and not die H4191 (8799).
042:003 And Joseph’s H3130 ten H6235 brethren H0251 went down H3381 (8799) to buy H7666 (8800) corn H1250 in Egypt H4714.
042:004 But Benjamin H1144, Joseph’s H3130 brother H0251, Jacob H3290 sent H7971 (8804) not with his brethren H0251; for he said H0559 (8804), Lest peradventure H6435 mischief H0611 befall him H7122 (8799).
042:005 And the sons H1121 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8799) to buy H7666 (8800) [corn] among H8432 those that came H0935 (8802): for the famine H7458 was in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
042:006 And Joseph H3130 [was] the governor H7989 over the land H0776, [and] he [it was] that sold H7666 (8688) to all the people H5971 of the land H0776: and Joseph’s H3130 brethren H0251 came H0935 (8799), and bowed down H7812 (8691) themselves before him [with] their faces H0639 to the earth H0776.
042:007 And Joseph H3130 saw H7200 (8799) his brethren H0251, and he knew H5234 (8686) them, but made himself strange H5234 (8691) unto them, and spake H1696 (8762) roughly H7186 unto them; and he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Whence H0370 come H0935 (8804) ye? And they said H0559 (8799), From the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 to buy H7666 (8800) food H0400.
042:008 And Joseph H3130 knew H5234 (8686) his brethren H0251, but they knew H5234 (8689) not him.
042:009 And Joseph H3130 remembered H2142 (8799) the dreams H2472 which he dreamed H2492 (8804) of them, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye [are] spies H7270 (8764); to see H7200 (8800) the nakedness H6172 of the land H0776 ye are come H0935 (8804).
042:010 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Nay, my lord H0113, but to buy H7666 (8800) food H0400 are thy servants H5650 come H0935 (8804).
042:011 We H5168 [are] all one H0259 man’s H0376 sons H1121; we [are] true H3651 [men], thy servants H5650 are no spies H7270 (8764).
042:012 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Nay, but to see H7200 (8800) the nakedness H6172 of the land H0776 ye are come H0935 (8804).
042:013 And they said H0559 (8799), Thy servants H5650 [are] twelve H8147 H6240 brethren H0251, the sons H1121 of one H0259 man H0376 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; and, behold, the youngest H6996 [is] this day H3117 with our father H0001, and one H0259 [is] not.
042:014 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto them, That [is it] that I spake H1696 (8765) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Ye [are] spies H7270 (8764):
042:015 Hereby H2063 ye shall be proved H0974 (8735): By the life H2416 of Pharaoh H6547 ye shall not go forth H3318 (8799) hence, except your youngest H6996 brother H0251 come H0935 (8800) hither.
042:016 Send H7971 (8798) one H0259 of you, and let him fetch H3947 (8799) your brother H0251, and ye shall be kept in prison H0631 (8734), that your words H1697 may be proved H0974 (8735), whether [there be any] truth H0571 in H0854 you: or else H3808 by the life H2416 of Pharaoh H6547 surely ye [are] spies H7270 (8764).
042:017 And he put them all together H0622 (8799) into ward H4929 three H7969 days H3117.
042:018 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto them the third H7992 day H3117, This do H6213 (8798), and live H2421 (8798); [for] I fear H3373 God H0430:
042:019 If ye [be] true H3651 [men], let one H0259 of your brethren H0251 be bound H0631 (8735) in the house H1004 of your prison H4929: go H3212 (8798) ye, carry H0935 (8685) corn H7668 for the famine H7459 of your houses H1004:
042:020 But bring H0935 (8686) your youngest H6996 brother H0251 unto me; so shall your words H1697 be verified H0539 (8735), and ye shall not die H4191 (8799). And they did H6213 (8799) so.
042:021 And they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H0251, We [are] verily H0061 guilty H0818 concerning our brother H0251, in that H0834 we saw H7200 (8804) the anguish H6869 of his soul H5315, when he besought H2603 (8692) us, and we would not hear H8085 (8804); therefore is this distress H6869 come H0935 (8804) upon us.
042:022 And Reuben H7205 answered H6030 (8799) them, saying H0559 (8800), Spake I H0559 (8804) not unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Do not sin H2398 (8799) against the child H3206; and ye would not hear H8085 (8804)? therefore, behold, also his blood H1818 is required H1875 (8738).
042:023 And they knew H3045 (8804) not that Joseph H3130 understood H8085 (8802) [them]; for he spake unto them by an interpreter H3887 (8688).
042:024 And he turned himself about H5437 (8735) from them, and wept H1058 (8799); and returned to them again H7725 (8799), and communed H1696 (8762) with them, and took H3947 (8799) from them Simeon H8095, and bound H0631 (8799) him before their eyes H5869.
042:025 Then Joseph H3130 commanded H6680 (8762) to fill H4390 (8762) their sacks H3627 with corn H1250, and to restore H7725 (8687) every man’s H0376 money H3701 into his sack H8242, and to give H5414 (8800) them provision H6720 for the way H1870: and thus H3651 did he H6213 (8799) unto them.
042:026 And they laded H5375 (8799) their asses H2543 with the corn H7668, and departed H3212 (8799) thence.
042:027 And as one H0259 of them opened H6605 (8799) his sack H8242 to give H5414 (8800) his ass H2543 provender H4554 in the inn H4411, he espied H7200 (8799) his money H3701; for, behold, it [was] in his sack’s H0572 mouth H6310.
042:028 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, My money H3701 is restored H7725 (8717); and, lo H2009, [it is] even in my sack H0572: and their heart H3820 failed H3318 (8799) [them], and they were afraid H2729 (8799), saying H0559 (8800) one H0376 to another H0251, What [is] this [that] God H0430 hath done H6213 (8804) unto us?
042:029 And they came H0935 (8799) unto Jacob H3290 their father H0001 unto the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and told H5046 (8686) him all that befell H7136 (8802) unto them; saying H0559 (8800),
042:030 The man H0376, [who is] the lord H0113 of the land H0776, spake H1696 (8765) roughly H7186 to us, and took H5414 (8799) us for spies H7270 (8764) of the country H0776.
042:031 And we said H0559 (8799) unto him, We [are] true H3651 [men]; we are no spies H7270 (8764):
042:032 We [be] twelve H6240 H8147 brethren H0251, sons H1121 of our father H0001; one H0259 [is] not, and the youngest H6996 [is] this day H3117 with our father H0001 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
042:033 And the man H0376, the lord H0113 of the country H0776, said H0559 (8799) unto us, Hereby shall I know H3045 (8799) that ye [are] true H3651 [men]; leave H3240 (8685) one H0259 of your brethren H0251 [here] with me, and take H3947 (8798) [food for] the famine H7459 of your households H1004, and be gone H3212 (8798):
042:034 And bring H0935 (8685) your youngest H6996 brother H0251 unto me: then shall I know H3045 (8799) that ye [are] no spies H7270 (8764), but [that] ye [are] true H3651 [men: so] will I deliver H5414 (8799) you your brother H0251, and ye shall traffick H5503 (8799) in the land H0776.
042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied H7324 (8688) their sacks H8242, that, behold, every man’s H0376 bundle H6872 of money H3701 [was] in his sack H8242: and when [both] they and their father H0001 saw H7200 (8799) the bundles H6872 of money H3701, they were afraid H3372 (8799).
042:036 And Jacob H3290 their father H0001 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Me have ye bereaved H7921 (8765) [of my children]: Joseph H3130 [is] not, and Simeon H8095 [is] not, and ye will take H3947 (8799) Benjamin H1144 [away]: all these things are against me.
042:037 And Reuben H7205 spake H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, saying H0559 (8800), Slay H4191 (8686) my two H8147 sons H1121, if I bring H0935 (8686) him not to thee: deliver H5414 (8798) him into my hand H3027, and I will bring him to thee again H7725 (8686).
042:038 And he said H0559 (8799), My son H1121 shall not go down H3381 (8799) with you; for his brother H0251 is dead H4191 (8804), and he is left H7604 (8738) alone: if mischief H0611 befall H7122 (8804) him by the way H1870 in the which ye go H3212 (8799), then shall ye bring down H3381 (8689) my gray hairs H7872 with sorrow H3015 to the grave H7585.
043:001 ¶ And the famine H7458 [was] sore H3515 in the land H0776.
043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up H3615 (8765) H0398 (8800) the corn H7668 which they had brought out H0935 (8689) of Egypt H4714, their father H0001 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Go again H7725 (8798), buy H7666 (8798) us a little H4592 food H0400.
043:003 And Judah H3063 spake H0559 (8799) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), The man H0376 did solemnly H5749 (8687) protest H5749 (8689) unto us, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not see H7200 (8799) my face H6440, except H1115 your brother H0251 [be] with you.
043:004 If thou wilt H3426 send H7971 (8764) our brother H0251 with us, we will go down H3381 (8799) and buy H7666 (8799) thee food H0400:
043:005 But if thou wilt not send H7971 (8764) [him], we will not go down H3381 (8799): for the man H0376 said H0559 (8804) unto us, Ye shall not see H7200 (8799) my face H6440, except your brother H0251 [be] with you.
043:006 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore dealt ye [so] ill H7489 (8689) with me, [as] to tell H5046 (8687) the man H0376 whether ye had yet a brother H0251?
043:007 And they said H0559 (8799), The man H0376 asked H7592 (8804) us straitly H7592 (8800) of our state, and of our kindred H4138, saying H0559 (8800), [Is] your father H0001 yet alive H2416? have ye H3426 [another] brother H0251? and we told H5046 (8686) him according H5921 to the tenor H6310 of these words H1697: could we certainly H3045 (8800) know H3045 (8799) that he would say H0559 (8799), Bring H3381 your brother H0251 down H3381 (8685)?
043:008 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799) unto Israel H3478 his father H0001, Send H7971 (8798) the lad H5288 with me, and we will arise H6965 (8799) and go H3212 (8799); that we may live H2421 (8799), and not die H4191 (8799), both we, and thou, [and] also our little ones H2945.
043:009 I will be surety H6148 (8799) for him; of my hand H3027 shalt thou require H1245 (8762) him: if H0518 I bring H0935 (8689) him not H0518 unto thee, and set H3322 (8689) him before thee H6440, then let me bear the blame H2398 (8804) for ever H3117:
043:010 For except H3884 we had lingered H4102 (8701), surely now we had returned H7725 (8804) this second time H6471.
043:011 And their father H0001 Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto them, If [it must be] so now H0645, do H6213 (8798) this; take H3947 (8798) of the best fruits H2173 in the land H0776 in your vessels H3627, and carry down H3381 (8685) the man H0376 a present H4503, a little H4592 balm H6875, and a little H4592 honey H1706, spices H5219, and myrrh H3910, nuts H0992, and almonds H8247:
043:012 And take H3947 (8798) double H4932 money H3701 in your hand H3027; and the money H3701 that was brought again H7725 (8716) in the mouth H6310 of your sacks H0572, carry [it] again H7725 (8686) in your hand H3027; peradventure it [was] an oversight H4870:
043:013 Take H3947 (8798) also your brother H0251, and arise H6965 (8798), go again H7725 (8798) unto the man H0376:
043:014 And God H0410 Almighty H7706 give H5414 (8799) you mercy H7356 before H6440 the man H0376, that he may send away H7971 (8765) your other H0312 brother H0251, and Benjamin H1144. If H0834 I be bereaved H7921 (8804) [of my children], I am bereaved H7921 (8804).
043:015 And the men H0582 took H3947 (8799) that H2063 present H4503, and they took H3947 (8804) double H4932 money H3701 in their hand H3027, and Benjamin H1144; and rose up H6965 (8799), and went down H3381 (8799) to Egypt H4714, and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 Joseph H3130.
043:016 And when Joseph H3130 saw H7200 (8799) Benjamin H1144 with H0854 them, he said H0559 (8799) to the ruler of his house H1004, Bring H0935 (8685) [these] men H0582 home H1004, and slay H2873 (8800) H2874, and make ready H3559 (8685); for [these] men H0582 shall dine H0398 (8799) with me at noon H6672.
043:017 And the man H0376 did H6213 (8799) as Joseph H3130 bade H0559 (8804); and the man H0376 brought H0935 (8686) the men H0582 into Joseph’s H3130 house H1004.
043:018 And the men H0582 were afraid H3372 (8799), because they were brought H0935 (8717) into Joseph’s H3130 house H1004; and they said H0559 (8799), Because H1697 of the money H3701 that was returned H7725 (8802) in our sacks H0572 at the first time H8462 are we brought in H0935 (8716); that he may seek occasion H1556 (8705) against us, and fall H5307 (8692) upon us, and take H3947 (8800) us for bondmen H5650, and our asses H2543.
043:019 And they came near H5066 (8799) to the steward H0376 of Joseph’s H3130 house H1004, and they communed H1696 (8762) with him at the door H6607 of the house H1004,
043:020 And said H0559 (8799), O H0994 sir H0113, we came indeed H3381 (8800) down H3381 (8804) at the first time H8462 to buy H7666 (8800) food H0400:
043:021 And it came to pass, when we came H0935 (8804) to the inn H4411, that we opened H6605 (8799) our sacks H0572, and, behold, [every] man’s H0376 money H3701 [was] in the mouth H6310 of his sack H0572, our money H3701 in full weight H4948: and we have brought it again H7725 (8686) in our hand H3027.
043:022 And other H0312 money H3701 have we brought down H3381 (8689) in our hands H3027 to buy H7666 (8800) food H0400: we cannot tell H3045 (8804) who put H7760 (8804) our money H3701 in our sacks H0572.
043:023 And he said H0559 (8799), Peace H7965 [be] to you, fear H3372 (8799) not: your God H0430, and the God H0430 of your father H0001, hath given H5414 (8804) you treasure H4301 in your sacks H0572: I had H0935 (8804) your money H3701. And he brought H3318 (8686) Simeon H8095 out unto them.
043:024 And the man H0376 brought H0935 (8686) the men H0582 into Joseph’s H3130 house H1004, and gave H5414 (8799) [them] water H4325, and they washed H7364 (8799) their feet H7272; and he gave H5414 (8799) their asses H2543 provender H4554.
043:025 And they made ready H3559 (8686) the present H4503 against H5704 Joseph H3130 came H0935 (8800) at noon H6672: for they heard H8085 (8804) that they should eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 there.
043:026 And when Joseph H3130 came H0935 (8799) home H1004, they brought H0935 (8686) him the present H4503 which [was] in their hand H3027 into the house H1004, and bowed H7812 (8691) themselves to him to the earth H0776.
043:027 And he asked H7592 (8799) them of [their] welfare H7965, and said H0559 (8799), [Is] your father H0001 well H7965, the old man H2205 of whom ye spake H0559 (8804)? [Is] he yet alive H2416?
043:028 And they answered H0559 (8799), Thy servant H5650 our father H0001 [is] in good health H7965, he [is] yet alive H2416. And they bowed down their heads H6915 (8799), and made obeisance H7812 (8691).
043:029 And he lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) his brother H0251 Benjamin H1144, his mother’s H0517 son H1121, and said H0559 (8799), [Is] this your younger H6996 brother H0251, of whom ye spake H0559 (8804) unto me? And he said H0559 (8799), God H0430 be gracious H2603 (8799) unto thee, my son H1121.
043:030 And Joseph H3130 made haste H4116 (8762); for his bowels H7356 did yearn H3648 (8738) upon his brother H0251: and he sought H1245 (8762) [where] to weep H1058 (8800); and he entered H0935 (8799) into [his] chamber H2315, and wept H1058 (8799) there.
043:031 And he washed H7364 (8799) his face H6440, and went out H3318 (8799), and refrained H0662 (8691) himself, and said H0559 (8799), Set on H7760 (8798) bread H3899.
043:032 And they set on H7760 (8799) for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians H4713, which did eat H0398 (8802) with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians H4713 might H3201 (8799) not eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899 with the Hebrews H5680; for that [is] an abomination H8441 unto the Egyptians H4714.
043:033 And they sat H3427 (8799) before him H6440, the firstborn H1060 according to his birthright H1062, and the youngest H6810 according to his youth H6812: and the men H0582 marvelled H8539 (8799) one H0376 at another H7453.
043:034 And he took H5375 (8799) [and sent] messes H4864 unto them from before him H6440: but Benjamin’s H1144 mess H4864 was five H2568 times H3027 so much as H7235 (8799) any of theirs. And they drank H8354 (8799), and were merry H7937 (8799) with him.
044:001 ¶ And he commanded H6680 (8762) the steward of his house H1004, saying H0559 (8800), Fill H4390 (8761) the men’s H0582 sacks H0572 [with] food H0400, as much as H0834 they can H3201 (8799) carry H5375 (8800), and put H7760 (8798) every man’s H0376 money H3701 in his sack’s H0572 mouth H6310.
044:002 And put H7760 (8799) my cup H1375, the silver H3701 cup H1375, in the sack’s H0572 mouth H6310 of the youngest H6996, and his corn H7668 money H3701. And he did H6213 (8799) according to the word H1697 that Joseph H3130 had spoken H1696 (8765).
044:003 As soon as the morning H1242 was light H0215 (8804), the men H0582 were sent away H7971 (8795), they and their asses H2543.
044:004 [And] when they were gone out H3318 (8804) of the city H5892, [and] not [yet] far off H7368 (8689), Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8804) unto his steward H1004, Up H6965 (8798), follow H7291 (8798) after H0310 the men H0582; and when thou dost overtake H5381 (8689) them, say H0559 (8804) unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded H7999 (8765) evil H7451 for good H2896?
044:005 [Is] not this [it] in which my lord H0113 drinketh H8354 (8799), and whereby indeed H5172 (8763) he divineth H5172 (8762)? ye have done evil H7489 (8689) in so doing H6213 (8804).
044:006 And he overtook H5381 (8686) them, and he spake H1696 (8762) unto them these same H0428 words H1697.
044:007 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherefore saith H1696 (8762) my lord H0113 these words H1697? God forbid H2486 that thy servants H5650 should do H6213 (8800) according to this thing H1697:
044:008 Behold, the money H3701, which we found H4672 (8804) in our sacks H0572 ’ mouths H6310, we brought again H7725 (8689) unto thee out of the land H0776 of Canaan H3667: how then should we steal H1589 (8799) out of thy lord’s H0113 house H1004 silver H3701 or gold H2091?
044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants H5650 it be found H4672 (8735), both let him die H4191 (8804), and we also will be my lord’s H0113 bondmen H5650.
044:010 And he said H0559 (8799), Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words H1697: H3651 he with whom it is found H4672 (8735) shall be my servant H5650; and ye shall be blameless H5355.
044:011 Then they speedily H4116 (8762) took down H3381 (8686) every man H0376 his sack H0572 to the ground H0776, and opened H6605 (8799) every man H0376 his sack H0572.
044:012 And he searched H2664 (8762), [and] began H2490 (8689) at the eldest H1419, and left H3615 (8765) at the youngest H6996: and the cup H1375 was found H4672 (8735) in Benjamin’s H1144 sack H0572.
044:013 Then they rent H7167 (8799) their clothes H8071, and laded H6006 (8799) every man H0376 his ass H2543, and returned H7725 (8799) to the city H5892.
044:014 And Judah H3063 and his brethren H0251 came H0935 (8799) to Joseph’s H3130 house H1004; for he [was] yet there: and they fell H5307 (8799) before him H6440 on the ground H0776.
044:015 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto them, What deed H4639 [is] this that ye have done H6213 (8804)? wot ye H3045 (8804) not that such a man H0376 as I can certainly H5172 (8763) divine H5172 (8762)?
044:016 And Judah H3063 said H0559 (8799), What shall we say H0559 (8799) unto my lord H0113? what shall we speak H1696 (8762)? or how shall we clear ourselves H6663 (8691)? God H0430 hath found out H4672 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of thy servants H5650: behold, we [are] my lord’s H0113 servants H5650, both we, and [he] also H1571 with whom H0834 H3027 the cup H1375 is found H4672 (8738).
044:017 And he said H0559 (8799), God forbid H2486 that I should do H6213 (8800) so H2063: [but] the man H0376 in whose hand H3027 the cup H1375 is found H4672 (8738), he shall be my servant H5650; and as for you, get you up H5927 (8798) in peace H7965 unto your father H0001.
044:018 Then Judah H3063 came near H5066 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), Oh H0994 my lord H0113, let thy servant H5650, I pray thee, speak H1696 (8762) a word H1697 in my lord’s H0113 ears H0241, and let not thine anger H0639 burn H2734 (8799) against thy servant H5650: for thou [art] even as Pharaoh H6547.
044:019 My lord H0113 asked H7592 (8804) his servants H5650, saying H0559 (8800), Have H3426 ye a father H0001, or a brother H0251?
044:020 And we said H0559 (8799) unto my lord H0113, We have H3426 a father H0001, an old man H2205, and a child H3206 of his old age H2208, a little one H6996; and his brother H0251 is dead H4191 (8804), and he alone is left H3498 (8735) of his mother H0517, and his father H0001 loveth H0157 (8804) him.
044:021 And thou saidst H0559 (8799) unto thy servants H5650, Bring him down H3381 (8685) unto me, that I may set H7760 (8799) mine eyes H5869 upon him.
044:022 And we said H0559 (8799) unto my lord H0113, The lad H5288 cannot H3201 (8799) leave H5800 (8800) his father H0001: for [if] he should leave H5800 (8804) his father H0001, [his father] would die H4191 (8804).
044:023 And thou saidst H0559 (8799) unto thy servants H5650, Except H3808 your youngest H6996 brother H0251 come down H3381 (8799) with you, ye shall see H7200 H3254 my face H6440 no more H7200 (8800) H3254 (8686).
044:024 And it came to pass when we came up H5927 (8804) unto thy servant H5650 my father H0001, we told H5046 (8686) him the words H1697 of my lord H0113.
044:025 And our father H0001 said H0559 (8799), Go again H7725 (8798), [and] buy H7666 (8798) us a little H4592 food H0400.
044:026 And we said H0559 (8799), We cannot H3201 (8799) go down H3381 (8800): if our youngest H6996 brother H0251 be H3426 with us, then will we go down H3381 (8804): for we may H3201 (8799) not see H7200 (8800) the man’s H0376 face H6440, except H0369 our youngest H6996 brother H0251 [be] with us.
044:027 And thy servant H5650 my father H0001 said H0559 (8799) unto us, Ye know H3045 (8804) that my wife H0802 bare H3205 (8804) me two H8147 [sons]:
044:028 And the one H0259 went out H3318 (8799) from me, and I said H0559 (8799), Surely H2963 (8800) he is torn in pieces H2963 (8776); and I saw him H7200 (8804) not since H2008:
044:029 And if ye take H3947 (8804) this also from H5973 me H6440, and mischief H0611 befall him H7136 (8804), ye shall bring down H3381 (8689) my gray hairs H7872 with sorrow H7451 to the grave H7585.
044:030 Now therefore when I come H0935 (8800) to thy servant H5650 my father H0001, and the lad H5288 [be] not with us; seeing that his life H5315 is bound up H7194 (8803) in the lad’s life H5315;
044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth H7200 (8800) that the lad H5288 [is] not [with us], that he will die H4191 (8804): and thy servants H5650 shall bring down H3381 (8689) the gray hairs H7872 of thy servant H5650 our father H0001 with sorrow H3015 to the grave H7585.
044:032 For thy servant H5650 became surety H6148 (8804) for the lad H5288 unto H5973 my father H0001, saying H0559 (8800), If I bring H0935 (8686) him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame H2398 (8804) to my father H0001 for ever H3117.
044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant H5650 abide H3427 (8799) instead of the lad H5288 a bondman H5650 to my lord H0113; and let the lad H5288 go up H5927 (8799) with his brethren H0251.
044:034 For how H0349 shall I go up H5927 (8799) to my father H0001, and the lad H5288 [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see H7200 (8799) the evil H7451 that shall come on H4672 (8799) my father H0001.
045:001 ¶ Then Joseph H3130 could H3201 (8804) not refrain H0662 (8692) himself before all them that stood H5324 (8737) by him; and he cried H7121 (8799), Cause H3318 every man H0376 to go out H3318 (8685) from me. And there stood H5975 (8804) no man H0376 with him, while Joseph H3130 made himself known H3045 (8692) unto his brethren H0251.
045:002 And he wept H6963 H1065 aloud H5414 (8799): and the Egyptians H4714 and the house H1004 of Pharaoh H6547 heard H8085 (8799) H8085 (8799).
045:003 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, I [am] Joseph H3130; doth my father H0001 yet live H2416? And his brethren H0251 could H3201 (8804) not answer H6030 (8800) him; for they were troubled H0926 (8738) at his presence H6440.
045:004 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, Come near H5066 (8798) to me, I pray you. And they came near H5066 (8799). And he said H0559 (8799), I [am] Joseph H3130 your brother H0251, whom ye sold H4376 (8804) into Egypt H4714.
045:005 Now therefore be not grieved H6087 (8735), nor angry H2734 (8799) with yourselves H5869, that ye sold H4376 (8804) me hither: for God H0430 did send H7971 (8804) me before you H6440 to preserve life H4241.
045:006 For these two years H8141 [hath] the famine H7458 [been] in H7130 the land H0776: and yet [there are] five H2568 years H8141, in the which [there shall] neither H0369 [be] earing H2758 nor harvest H7105.
045:007 And God H0430 sent H7971 (8799) me before you H6440 to preserve H7760 (8800) you a posterity H7611 in the earth H0776, and to save your lives H2421 (8687) by a great H1419 deliverance H6413.
045:008 So now [it was] not you [that] sent H7971 (8804) me hither, but God H0430: and he hath made H7760 (8799) me a father H0001 to Pharaoh H6547, and lord H0113 of all his house H1004, and a ruler H4910 (8802) throughout all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
045:009 Haste H4116 (8761) ye, and go up H5927 (8798) to my father H0001, and say H0559 (8804) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) thy son H1121 Joseph H3130, God H0430 hath made H7760 (8804) me lord H0113 of all Egypt H4714: come down H3381 (8798) unto me, tarry H5975 (8799) not:
045:010 And thou shalt dwell H3427 (8804) in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657, and thou shalt be near H7138 unto me, thou, and thy children H1121, and thy children’s H1121 children H1121, and thy flocks H6629, and thy herds H1241, and all that thou hast:
045:011 And there will I nourish H3557 (8773) thee; for yet [there are] five H2568 years H8141 of famine H7458; lest thou, and thy household H1004, and all that thou hast, come to poverty H3423 (8735).
045:012 And, behold, your eyes H5869 see H7200 (8802), and the eyes H5869 of my brother H0251 Benjamin H1144, that [it is] my mouth H6310 that speaketh H1696 (8764) unto you.
045:013 And ye shall tell H5046 (8689) my father H0001 of all my glory H3519 in Egypt H4714, and of all that ye have seen H7200 (8804); and ye shall haste H4116 (8765) and bring down H3381 (8689) my father H0001 hither.
045:014 And he fell H5307 (8799) upon his brother H0251 Benjamin’s H1144 neck H6677, and wept H1058 (8799); and Benjamin H1144 wept H1058 (8804) upon his neck H6677.
045:015 Moreover he kissed H5401 (8762) all his brethren H0251, and wept H1058 (8799) upon them: and after H0310 that his brethren H0251 talked H1696 (8765) with him.
045:016 And the fame H6963 thereof was heard H8085 (8738) in Pharaoh’s H6547 house H1004, saying H0559 (8800), Joseph’s H3130 brethren H0251 are come H0935 (8804): and it pleased H3190 H5869 Pharaoh H6547 well H3190 (8799) H5869, and H5869 his servants H5650.
045:017 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Say H0559 (8798) unto thy brethren H0251, This do H6213 (8798) ye; lade H2943 (8798) your beasts H1165, and go H3212 (8798), get H0935 (8798) you unto the land H0776 of Canaan H3667;
045:018 And take H3947 (8798) your father H0001 and your households H1004, and come H0935 (8798) unto me: and I will give H5414 (8799) you the good H2898 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and ye shall eat H0398 (8798) the fat H2459 of the land H0776.
045:019 Now thou art commanded H6680 (8795), this do H6213 (8798) ye; take H3947 (8798) you wagons H5699 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 for your little ones H2945, and for your wives H0802, and bring H5375 (8804) your father H0001, and come H0935 (8804).
045:020 Also H5869 regard H2347 (8799) not your stuff H3627; for the good H2898 of all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 [is] yours.
045:021 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8799) so: and Joseph H3130 gave H5414 (8799) them wagons H5699, according to the commandment H6310 of Pharaoh H6547, and gave H5414 (8799) them provision H6720 for the way H1870.
045:022 To all of them he gave H5414 (8804) each man H0376 changes H2487 of raiment H8071; but to Benjamin H1144 he gave H5414 (8804) three H7969 hundred H3967 [pieces] of silver H3701, and five H2568 changes H2487 of raiment H8071.
045:023 And to his father H0001 he sent H7971 (8804) after this H2063 [manner]; ten H6235 asses H0860 laden H5375 (8802) with the good things H2898 of Egypt H4714, and ten H6235 she asses H2543 laden H5375 (8802) with corn H1250 and bread H3899 and meat H4202 for his father H0001 by the way H1870.
045:024 So he sent H7971 his brethren H0251 away H7971 (8762), and they departed H3212 (8799): and he said H0559 (8799) unto them, See that ye fall not out H7264 (8799) by the way H1870.
045:025 And they went up H5927 (8799) out of Egypt H4714, and came H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 unto Jacob H3290 their father H0001,
045:026 And told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), Joseph H3130 [is] yet alive H2416, and he [is] governor H4910 (8802) over all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714. And Jacob’s heart H3820 fainted H6313 (8799), for he believed H0539 (8689) them not.
045:027 And they told H1696 (8762) him all the words H1697 of Joseph H3130, which he had said H1696 (8765) unto them: and when he saw H7200 (8799) the wagons H5699 which Joseph H3130 had sent H7971 (8804) to carry H5375 (8800) him, the spirit H7307 of Jacob H3290 their father H0001 revived H2421 (8799):
045:028 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), [It is] enough H7227; Joseph H3130 my son H1121 [is] yet alive H2416: I will go H3212 (8799) and see him H7200 (8799) before I die H4191 (8799).
046:001 ¶ And Israel H3478 took his journey H5265 (8799) with all that he had, and came H0935 (8799) to Beersheba H0884, and offered H2076 (8799) sacrifices H2077 unto the God H0430 of his father H0001 Isaac H3327.
046:002 And God H0430 spake H0559 (8799) unto Israel H3478 in the visions H4759 of the night H3915, and said H0559 (8799), Jacob H3290, Jacob H3290. And he said H0559 (8799), Here [am] I.
046:003 And he said H0559 (8799), I [am] God H0410, the God H0430 of thy father H0001: fear H3372 (8799) not to go down H3381 (8800) into Egypt H4714; for I will there make H7760 (8799) of thee a great H1419 nation H1471:
046:004 I will go down H3381 (8799) with thee into Egypt H4714; and I will also surely H5927 (8800) bring thee up H5927 (8686) [again]: and Joseph H3130 shall put H7896 (8799) his hand H3027 upon thine eyes H5869.
046:005 And Jacob H3290 rose up H6965 (8799) from Beersheba H0884: and the sons H1121 of Israel H3478 carried H5375 (8799) Jacob H3290 their father H0001, and their little ones H2945, and their wives H0802, in the wagons H5699 which Pharaoh H6547 had sent H7971 (8804) to carry H5375 (8800) him.
046:006 And they took H3947 (8799) their cattle H4735, and their goods H7399, which they had gotten H7408 (8804) in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and came H0935 (8799) into Egypt H4714, Jacob H3290, and all his seed H2233 with him:
046:007 His sons H1121, and his sons H1121 ’ sons H1121 with him, his daughters H1323, and his sons H1121 ’ daughters H1323, and all his seed H2233 brought he H0935 (8689) with him into Egypt H4714.
046:008 And these [are] the names H8034 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which came H0935 (8802) into Egypt H4714, Jacob H3290 and his sons H1121: Reuben H7205, Jacob’s H3290 firstborn H1060.

046:019 The sons H1121 of Rachel H7354 Jacob’s H3290 wife H0802; Joseph H3130, and Benjamin H1144.
046:020 And unto Joseph H3130 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 were born H3205 (8735) Manasseh H4519 and Ephraim H0669, which Asenath H0621 the daughter H1323 of Potipherah H6319 priest H3548 of On H0204 bare H3205 (8804) unto him.

046:026 All the souls H5315 that came H0935 (8802) with Jacob H3290 into Egypt H4714, which came out H3318 (8802) of his loins H3409, besides Jacob’s H3290 sons H1121 ’ wives H0802, all the souls H5315 [were] threescore H8346 and six H8337;
046:027 And the sons H1121 of Joseph H3130, which were born H3205 (8795) him in Egypt H4714, [were] two H8147 souls H5315: all the souls H5315 of the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, which came H0935 (8802) into Egypt H4714, [were] threescore and ten H7657.
046:028 And he sent H7971 (8804) Judah H3063 before him H6440 unto Joseph H3130, to direct H3384 (8687) his face H6440 unto Goshen H1657; and they came H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of Goshen H1657.
046:029 And Joseph H3130 made ready H0631 (8799) his chariot H4818, and went up H5927 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) Israel H3478 his father H0001, to Goshen H1657, and presented H7200 (8735) himself unto him; and he fell H5307 (8799) on his neck H6677, and wept H1058 (8799) on his neck H6677 a good while H5750.
046:030 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Now H6471 let me die H4191 (8799), since H0310 I have seen H7200 (8800) thy face H6440, because thou [art] yet H5750 alive H2416.
046:031 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, and unto his father’s H0001 house H1004, I will go up H5927 (8799), and shew H5046 (8686) Pharaoh H6547, and say H0559 (8799) unto him, My brethren H0251, and my father’s H0001 house H1004, which [were] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, are come H0935 (8804) unto me;
046:032 And the men H0582 [are] shepherds H7462 (8802) H6629, for their trade hath been to feed cattle H4735; and they have brought H0935 (8689) their flocks H6629, and their herds H1241, and all that they have.
046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh H6547 shall call H7121 (8799) you, and shall say H0559 (8804), What [is] your occupation H4639?
046:034 That ye shall say H0559 (8804), Thy servants H5650 ’ trade H0582 hath been about cattle H4735 from our youth H5271 even until now, both we, [and] also our fathers H0001: that ye may dwell H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657; for every shepherd H7462 (8802) H6629 [is] an abomination H8441 unto the Egyptians H4714.
047:001 ¶ Then Joseph H3130 came H0935 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) Pharaoh H6547, and said H0559 (8799), My father H0001 and my brethren H0251, and their flocks H6629, and their herds H1241, and all that they have, are come out H0935 (8804) of the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; and, behold, they [are] in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657.
047:002 And he took H3947 (8804) some H7097 of his brethren H0251, [even] five H2568 men H0582, and presented H3322 (8686) them unto H6440 Pharaoh H6547.
047:003 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, What [is] your occupation H4639? And they said H0559 (8799) unto Pharaoh H6547, Thy servants H5650 [are] shepherds H7462 (8802) H6629, both we, [and] also our fathers H0001.
047:004 They said H0559 (8799) moreover unto Pharaoh H6547, For to sojourn H1481 (8800) in the land H0776 are we come H0935 (8804); for thy servants H5650 have no pasture H4829 for their flocks H6629; for the famine H7458 [is] sore H3515 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants H5650 dwell H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657.
047:005 And Pharaoh H6547 spake H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, saying H0559 (8800), Thy father H0001 and thy brethren H0251 are come H0935 (8804) unto thee:
047:006 The land H0776 of Egypt H4714 [is] before thee H6440; in the best H4315 of the land H0776 make H3427 thy father H0001 and brethren H0251 to dwell H3427 (8685); in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657 let them dwell H3427 (8799): and if thou knowest H3045 (8804) H3426 [any] men H0582 of activity H2428 among them, then make them H7760 (8804) rulers H8269 over my cattle H4735.
047:007 And Joseph H3130 brought in H0935 (8686) Jacob H3290 his father H0001, and set him H5975 (8686) before H6440 Pharaoh H6547: and Jacob H3290 blessed H1288 (8762) Pharaoh H6547.
047:008 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799) unto Jacob H3290, How H4100 old H2416 H3117 H8141 [art] thou?
047:009 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto Pharaoh H6547, The days H3117 of the years H8141 of my pilgrimage H4033 [are] an hundred H3967 and thirty H7970 years H8141: few H4592 and evil H7451 have the days H3117 of the years H8141 of my life H2416 been, and have not attained H5381 (8689) unto the days H3117 of the years H8141 of the life H2416 of my fathers H0001 in the days H3117 of their pilgrimage H4033.
047:010 And Jacob H3290 blessed H1288 (8762) Pharaoh H6547, and went out H3318 (8799) from before H6440 Pharaoh H6547.
047:011 And Joseph H3130 placed H3427 (8686) his father H0001 and his brethren H0251, and gave H5414 (8799) them a possession H0272 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, in the best H4315 of the land H0776, in the land H0776 of Rameses H7486, as Pharaoh H6547 had commanded H6680 (8765).
047:012 And Joseph H3130 nourished H3557 (8770) his father H0001, and his brethren H0251, and all his father’s H0001 household H1004, with bread H3899, according H6310 to [their] families H2945.
047:013 And [there was] no bread H3899 in all the land H0776; for the famine H7458 [was] very H3966 sore H3515, so that the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 and [all] the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 fainted H3856 (8799) by reason H6440 of the famine H7458.
047:014 And Joseph H3130 gathered up H3950 (8762) all the money H3701 that was found H4672 (8737) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, for the corn H7668 which they bought H7666 (8802): and Joseph H3130 brought H0935 (8686) the money H3701 into Pharaoh’s H6547 house H1004.
047:015 And when money H3701 failed H8552 (8799) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, all the Egyptians H4714 came H0935 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, and said H0559 (8800), Give H3051 (8798) us bread H3899: for why should we die H4191 (8799) in thy presence? for the money H3701 faileth H0656 (8804).
047:016 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799), Give H3051 (8798) your cattle H4735; and I will give H5414 (8799) you for your cattle H4735, if money H3701 fail H0656 (8804).
047:017 And they brought H0935 (8686) their cattle H4735 unto Joseph H3130: and Joseph H3130 gave H5414 (8799) them bread H3899 [in exchange] for horses H5483, and for the flocks H6629, and for the cattle H4735 of the herds H1241, and for the asses H2543: and he fed H5095 (8762) them with bread H3899 for all their cattle H4735 for that year H8141.
047:018 When that year H8141 was ended H8552 (8799), they came H0935 (8799) unto him the second H8145 year H8141, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, We will not hide H3582 (8762) [it] from my lord H0113, how that our money H3701 is spent H8552 (8804); my lord H0113 also hath H0413 our herds H4735 of cattle H0929; there is not ought left H7604 (8738) in the sight H6440 of my lord H0113, but our bodies H1472, and our lands H0127:
047:019 Wherefore shall we die H4191 (8799) before thine eyes H5869, both we and our land H0127? buy H7069 (8798) us and our land H0127 for bread H3899, and we and our land H0127 will be servants H5650 unto Pharaoh H6547: and give H5414 (8798) [us] seed H2233, that we may live H2421 (8799), and not die H4191 (8799), that the land H0127 be not desolate H3456 (8799).
047:020 And Joseph H3130 bought H7069 (8799) all the land H0127 of Egypt H4714 for Pharaoh H6547; for the Egyptians H4714 sold H4376 (8804) every man H0376 his field H7704, because the famine H7458 prevailed H2388 (8804) over them: so the land H0776 became Pharaoh’s H6547.
047:021 And as for the people H5971, he removed H5674 (8689) them to cities H5892 from [one] end H7097 of the borders H1366 of Egypt H4714 even to the [other] end H7097 thereof.
047:022 Only the land H0127 of the priests H3548 bought he H7069 (8804) not; for the priests H3548 had a portion H2706 [assigned them] of Pharaoh H6547, and did eat H0398 (8804) their portion H2706 which Pharaoh H6547 gave H5414 (8804) them: wherefore they sold H4376 (8804) not their lands H0127.
047:023 Then Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Behold, I have bought H7069 (8804) H0853 you this day H3117 and your land H0127 for Pharaoh H6547: lo H1887, [here is] seed H2233 for you, and ye shall sow H2232 (8804) the land H0127.
047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase H8393, that ye shall give H5414 (8804) the fifth H2549 [part] unto Pharaoh H6547, and four H0702 parts H3027 shall be your own, for seed H2233 of the field H7704, and for your food H0400, and for them of your households H1004, and for food H0398 (8800) for your little ones H2945.
047:025 And they said H0559 (8799), Thou hast saved our lives H2421 (8689): let us find H4672 (8799) grace H2580 in the sight H5869 of my lord H0113, and we will be Pharaoh’s H6547 servants H5650.
047:026 And Joseph H3130 made H7760 (8799) it a law H2706 over the land H0127 of Egypt H4714 unto this day H3117, [that] Pharaoh H6547 should have the fifth H2569 [part]; except H7535 the land H0127 of the priests H3548 only, [which] became not Pharaoh’s H6547.
047:027 And Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, in the country H0776 of Goshen H1657; and they had possessions H0270 (8735) therein, and grew H6509 (8799), and multiplied H7235 (8799) exceedingly H3966.
047:028 And Jacob H3290 lived H2421 (8799) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 seventeen H6240 H7651 years H8141: so the whole age H2416 H3117 of Jacob H3290 was an hundred H3967 forty H0705 H8141 and seven H7651 years H8141.
047:029 And the time H3117 drew nigh H7126 (8799) that Israel H3478 must die H4191 (8800): and he called H7121 (8799) his son H1121 Joseph H3130, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, If now I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, put H7760 (8798), I pray thee, thy hand H3027 under my thigh H3409, and deal H6213 (8804) kindly H2617 and truly H0571 with me; bury H6912 (8799) me not, I pray thee, in Egypt H4714:
047:030 But I will lie H7901 (8804) with my fathers H0001, and thou shalt carry H5375 (8804) me out of Egypt H4714, and bury H6912 (8804) me in their buryingplace H6900. And he said H0559 (8799), I will do H6213 (8799) as thou hast said H1697.
047:031 And he said H0559 (8799), Swear H7650 (8734) unto me. And he sware H7650 (8735) unto him. And Israel H3478 bowed H7812 (8691) himself upon the bed’s H4296 head H7218.
048:001 ¶ And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, that [one] told H0559 (8799) Joseph H3130, Behold, thy father H0001 [is] sick H2470 (8802): and he took H3947 (8799) with him his two H8147 sons H1121, Manasseh H4519 and Ephraim H0669.
048:002 And [one] told H5046 (8686) Jacob H3290, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, thy son H1121 Joseph H3130 cometh H0935 (8802) unto thee: and Israel H3478 strengthened H2388 (8691) himself, and sat H3427 (8799) upon the bed H4296.
048:003 And Jacob H3290 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, God H0410 Almighty H7706 appeared H7200 (8738) unto me at Luz H3870 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and blessed H1288 (8762) me,
048:004 And said H0559 (8799) unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful H6509 (8688), and multiply H7235 (8689) thee, and I will make H5414 (8804) of thee a multitude H6951 of people H5971; and will give H5414 (8804) this land H0776 to thy seed H2233 after thee H0310 [for] an everlasting H5769 possession H0272.
048:005 And now thy two H8147 sons H1121, Ephraim H0669 and Manasseh H4519, which were born H3205 (8737) unto thee in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 before H5704 I came H0935 (8800) unto thee into Egypt H4714, [are] mine; as Reuben H7205 and Simeon H8095, they shall be mine.
048:006 And thy issue H4138, which thou begettest H3205 (8689) after H0310 them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called H7121 (8735) after H5921 the name H8034 of their brethren H0251 in their inheritance H5159.
048:007 And as for me, when I came H0935 (8800) from Padan H6307, Rachel H7354 died H4191 (8804) by me in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 in the way H1870, when H5750 yet [there was] but a little H3530 way H0776 to come H0935 (8800) unto Ephrath H0672: and I buried her H6912 (8799) there in the way H1870 of Ephrath H0672; the same [is] Bethlehem H1035.
048:008 And Israel H3478 beheld H7200 (8799) Joseph’s H3130 sons H1121, and said H0559 (8799), Who [are] these?
048:009 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, They [are] my sons H1121, whom God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) me in this [place]. And he said H0559 (8799), Bring them H3947 (8798), I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless H1288 (8762) them.
048:010 Now the eyes H5869 of Israel H3478 were dim H3513 (8804) for age H2207, [so that] he could H3201 (8799) not see H7200 (8800). And he brought them near H5066 (8686) unto him; and he kissed H5401 (8799) them, and embraced H2263 (8762) them.
048:011 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, I had not thought H6419 (8765) to see H7200 (8800) thy face H6440: and, lo, God H0430 hath shewed H7200 (8689) me also thy seed H2233.
048:012 And Joseph H3130 brought them out H3318 (8686) from between H5973 his knees H1290, and he bowed H7812 (8691) himself with his face H0639 to the earth H0776.
048:013 And Joseph H3130 took H3947 (8799) them both H8147, Ephraim H0669 in his right hand H3225 toward Israel’s H3478 left hand H8040, and Manasseh H4519 in his left hand H8040 toward Israel’s H3478 right hand H3225, and brought [them] near H5066 (8686) unto him.
048:014 And Israel H3478 stretched out H7971 (8799) his right hand H3225, and laid H7896 (8799) [it] upon Ephraim’s H0669 head H7218, who [was] the younger H6810, and his left hand H8040 upon Manasseh’s H4519 head H7218, guiding H7919 his hands H3027 wittingly H7919 (8765); for Manasseh H4519 [was] the firstborn H1060.
048:015 And he blessed H1288 (8762) Joseph H3130, and said H0559 (8799), God H0430, before H6440 whom my fathers H0001 Abraham H0085 and Isaac H3327 did walk H1980 (8694), the God H0430 which fed H7462 (8802) me all my life long H5750 unto this day H3117,
048:016 The Angel H4397 which redeemed H1350 (8802) me from all evil H7451, bless H1288 (8762) the lads H5288; and let my name H8034 be named H7121 (8735) on them, and the name H8034 of my fathers H0001 Abraham H0085 and Isaac H3327; and let them grow H1711 (8799) into a multitude H7230 in the midst H7130 of the earth H0776.
048:017 And when Joseph H3130 saw H7200 (8799) that his father H0001 laid H7896 (8799) his right H3225 hand H3027 upon the head H7218 of Ephraim H0669, it displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 him: and he held up H8551 (8799) his father’s H0001 hand H3027, to remove H5493 (8687) it from Ephraim’s H0669 head H7218 unto Manasseh’s H4519 head H7218.
048:018 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, Not so, my father H0001: for this [is] the firstborn H1060; put H7760 (8798) thy right hand H3225 upon his head H7218.
048:019 And his father H0001 refused H3985 (8762), and said H0559 (8799), I know H3045 (8804) [it], my son H1121, I know H3045 (8804) [it]: he also shall become a people H5971, and he also shall be great H1431 (8799): but truly H0199 his younger H6996 brother H0251 shall be greater H1431 (8799) than he, and his seed H2233 shall become a multitude H4393 of nations H1471.
048:020 And he blessed H1288 (8762) them that day H3117, saying H0559 (8800), In thee shall Israel H3478 bless H1288 (8762), saying H0559 (8800), God H0430 make H7760 (8799) thee as Ephraim H0669 and as Manasseh H4519: and he set H7760 (8799) Ephraim H0669 before H6440 Manasseh H4519.
048:021 And Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Behold, I die H4191 (8801): but God H0430 shall be with you, and bring you again H7725 (8689) unto the land H0776 of your fathers H0001.
048:022 Moreover I have given H5414 (8804) to thee one H0259 portion H7926 above thy brethren H0251, which I took H3947 (8804) out of the hand H3027 of the Amorite H0567 with my sword H2719 and with my bow H7198.
049:001 ¶ And Jacob H3290 called H7121 (8799) unto his sons H1121, and said H0559 (8799), Gather yourselves together H0622 (8734), that I may tell H5046 (8686) you [that] which shall befall H7122 (8799) you in the last H0319 days H3117.
049:002 Gather yourselves together H6908 (8734), and hear H8085 (8798), ye sons H1121 of Jacob H3290; and hearken H8085 (8798) unto Israel H3478 your father H0001.
049:003 Reuben H7205, thou [art] my firstborn H1060, my might H3581, and the beginning H7225 of my strength H0202, the excellency H3499 of dignity H7613, and the excellency H3499 of power H5794:
049:004 Unstable H6349 as water H4325, thou shalt not excel H3498 (8686); because thou wentest up H5927 (8804) to thy father’s H0001 bed H4904; then defiledst thou H2490 (8765) [it]: he went up H5927 (8804) to my couch H3326.
049:005 Simeon H8095 and Levi H3878 [are] brethren H0251; instruments H3627 of cruelty H2555 [are in] their habitations H4380.
049:006 O my soul H5315, come H0935 (8799) not thou into their secret H5475; unto their assembly H6951, mine honour H3519, be not thou united H3161 (8799): for in their anger H0639 they slew H2026 (8804) a man H0376, and in their selfwill H7522 they digged down H6131 (8765) a wall H7794.
049:007 Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] their anger H0639, for [it was] fierce H5794; and their wrath H5678, for it was cruel H7185 (8804): I will divide H2505 (8762) them in Jacob H3290, and scatter H6327 (8686) them in Israel H3478.
049:008 Judah H3063, thou [art he] whom thy brethren H0251 shall praise H3034 (8686): thy hand H3027 [shall be] in the neck H6203 of thine enemies H0341 (8802); thy father’s H0001 children H1121 shall bow down H7812 (8691) before thee.
049:009 Judah H3063 [is] a lion’s H0738 whelp H1482: from the prey H2964, my son H1121, thou art gone up H5927 (8804): he stooped down H3766 (8804), he couched H7257 (8804) as a lion H0738, and as an old lion H3833; who shall rouse him up H6965 (8686)?
049:010 The sceptre H7626 shall not depart H5493 (8799) from Judah H3063, nor a lawgiver H2710 (8781) from between his feet H7272, until H3588 Shiloh H7886 come H0935 (8799); and unto him [shall] the gathering H3349 of the people H5971 [be].
049:011 Binding H0631 (8802) his foal H5895 unto the vine H1612, and his ass’s H0860 colt H1121 unto the choice vine H8321; he washed H3526 (8765) his garments H3830 in wine H3196, and his clothes H5497 in the blood H1818 of grapes H6025:
049:012 His eyes H5869 [shall be] red H2447 with wine H3196, and his teeth H8127 white H3836 with milk H2461.
049:013 Zebulun H2074 shall dwell H7931 (8799) at the haven H2348 of the sea H3220; and he [shall be] for an haven H2348 of ships H0591; and his border H3411 [shall be] unto Zidon H6721.
049:014 Issachar H3485 [is] a strong H1634 ass H2543 couching down H7257 (8802) between two burdens H4942:
049:015 And he saw H7200 (8799) that rest H4496 [was] good H2896, and the land H0776 that [it was] pleasant H5276 (8804); and bowed H5186 (8799) his shoulder H7926 to bear H5445 (8800), and became a servant H5647 (8802) unto tribute H4522.
049:016 Dan H1835 shall judge H1777 (8799) his people H5971, as one H0259 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478.
049:017 Dan H1835 shall be a serpent H5175 by the way H1870, an adder H8207 in the path H0734, that biteth H5391 (8802) the horse H5483 heels H6119, so that his rider H7392 (8802) shall fall H5307 (8799) backward H0268.
049:018 I have waited for H6960 (8765) thy salvation H3444, O LORD H3068.
049:019 Gad H1410, a troop H1416 shall overcome H1464 (8799) him: but he shall overcome H1464 (8799) at the last H6119.
049:020 Out of Asher H0836 his bread H3899 [shall be] fat H8082, and he shall yield H5414 (8799) royal H4428 dainties H4574.
049:021 Naphtali H5321 [is] a hind H0355 let loose H7971 (8803): he giveth H5414 (8802) goodly H8233 words H0561.
049:022 Joseph H3130 [is] a fruitful H6509 (8802) bough H1121, [even] a fruitful H6509 (8802) bough H1121 by a well H5869; [whose] branches H1323 run H6805 (8804) over the wall H7791:
049:023 The archers H1167 H2671 have sorely grieved him H4843 (8762), and shot H7232 (8804) [at him], and hated him H7852 (8799):
049:024 But his bow H7198 abode H3427 (8799) in strength H0386, and the arms H2220 of his hands H3027 were made strong H6339 (8799) by the hands H3027 of the mighty H0046 [God] of Jacob H3290; (from thence [is] the shepherd H7462 (8802), the stone H0068 of Israel H3478:)
049:025 [Even] by the God H0410 of thy father H0001, who shall help H5826 (8799) thee; and by H0854 the Almighty H7706, who shall bless H1288 (8762) thee with blessings H1293 of heaven H8064 above H5920, blessings H1293 of the deep H8415 that lieth H7257 (8802) under, blessings H1293 of the breasts H7699, and of the womb H7356:
049:026 The blessings H1293 of thy father H0001 have prevailed H1396 (8804) above the blessings H1293 of my progenitors H2029 (8802) unto the utmost bound H8379 of the everlasting H5769 hills H1389: they shall be on the head H7218 of Joseph H3130, and on the crown of the head H6936 of him that was separate H5139 from his brethren H0251.
049:027 Benjamin H1144 shall ravin H2963 (8799) [as] a wolf H2061: in the morning H1242 he shall devour H0398 (8799) the prey H5706, and at night H6153 he shall divide H2505 (8762) the spoil H7998.
049:028 All these [are] the twelve H6240 H8147 tribes H7626 of Israel H3478: and this [is it] that their father H0001 spake H1696 (8765) unto them, and blessed H1288 (8762) them; every H0834 one H0376 according to his blessing H1293 he blessed H1288 (8765) them.
049:029 And he charged H6680 (8762) them, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, I am to be gathered H0622 (8737) unto my people H5971: bury H6912 (8798) me with my fathers H0001 in the cave H4631 that [is] in the field H7704 of Ephron H6085 the Hittite H2850,
049:030 In the cave H4631 that [is] in the field H7704 of Machpelah H4375, which [is] before H6440 Mamre H4471, in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, which Abraham H0085 bought H7069 (8804) with the field H7704 of Ephron H6085 the Hittite H2850 for a possession H0272 of a buryingplace H6913.
049:031 There they buried H6912 (8804) Abraham H0085 and Sarah H8283 his wife H0802; there they buried H6912 (8804) Isaac H3327 and Rebekah H7259 his wife H0802; and there I buried H6912 (8804) Leah H3812.
049:032 The purchase H4735 of the field H7704 and of the cave H4631 that [is] therein [was] from the children H1121 of Heth H2845.
049:033 And when Jacob H3290 had made an end H3615 (8762) of commanding H6680 (8763) his sons H1121, he gathered up H0622 (8799) his feet H7272 into the bed H4296, and yielded up the ghost H1478 (8799), and was gathered H0622 (8735) unto his people H5971.
050:001 ¶ And Joseph H3130 fell H5307 (8799) upon his father’s H0001 face H6440, and wept H1058 (8799) upon him, and kissed H5401 (8799) him.
050:002 And Joseph H3130 commanded H6680 (8762) his servants H5650 the physicians H7495 (8802) to embalm H2590 (8800) his father H0001: and the physicians H7495 (8802) embalmed H2590 (8799) Israel H3478.
050:003 And forty H0705 days H3117 were fulfilled H4390 (8799) for him; for so are fulfilled H4390 (8799) the days H3117 of those which are embalmed H2590 (8803): and the Egyptians H4714 mourned H1058 (8799) for him threescore and ten H7657 days H3117.
050:004 And when the days H3117 of his mourning H1068 were past H5674 (8799), Joseph H3130 spake H1696 (8762) unto the house H1004 of Pharaoh H6547, saying H0559 (8800), If now I have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in your eyes H5869, speak H1696 (8761), I pray you, in the ears H0241 of Pharaoh H6547, saying H0559 (8800),
050:005 My father H0001 made me swear H7650 (8689), saying H0559 (8800), Lo H2009, I die H4191 (8801): in my grave H6913 which I have digged H3738 (8804) for me in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, there shalt thou bury me H6912 (8799). Now therefore let me go up H5927 (8799), I pray thee, and bury H6912 (8799) my father H0001, and I will come again H7725 (8799).
050:006 And Pharaoh H6547 said H0559 (8799), Go up H5927 (8798), and bury H6912 (8798) thy father H0001, according as he made thee swear H7650 (8689).
050:007 And Joseph H3130 went up H5927 (8799) to bury H6912 (8800) his father H0001: and with him went up H5927 (8799) all the servants H5650 of Pharaoh H6547, the elders H2205 of his house H1004, and all the elders H2205 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714,
050:008 And all the house H1004 of Joseph H3130, and his brethren H0251, and his father’s H0001 house H1004: only their little ones H2945, and their flocks H6629, and their herds H1241, they left H5800 (8804) in the land H0776 of Goshen H1657.
050:009 And there went up H5927 (8799) with him both chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571: and it was a very H3966 great H3515 company H4264.
050:010 And they came H0935 (8799) to the threshingfloor H1637 of Atad H0329, which [is] beyond H5676 Jordan H3383, and there they mourned H5594 (8799) with a great H1419 and very H3966 sore H3515 lamentation H4553: and he made H6213 (8799) a mourning H0060 for his father H0001 seven H7651 days H3117.
050:011 And when the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776, the Canaanites H3669, saw H7200 (8799) the mourning H0060 in the floor H1637 of Atad H0329, they said H0559 (8799), This [is] a grievous H3515 mourning H0060 to the Egyptians H4714: wherefore the name of it H8034 was called H7121 (8804) Abelmizraim H0067, which [is] beyond H5676 Jordan H3383.
050:012 And his sons H1121 did H6213 (8799) unto him according as he commanded H6680 (8765) them:
050:013 For his sons H1121 carried H5375 (8799) him into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and buried H6912 (8799) him in the cave H4631 of the field H7704 of Machpelah H4375, which Abraham H0085 bought H7069 (8804) with the field H7704 for a possession H0272 of a buryingplace H6913 of Ephron H6085 the Hittite H2850, before H6440 Mamre H4471.
050:014 And Joseph H3130 returned H7725 (8799) into Egypt H4714, he, and his brethren H0251, and all that went up H5927 (8802) with him to bury H6912 (8800) his father H0001, after H0310 he had buried H6912 (8800) his father H0001.
050:015 And when Joseph’s H3130 brethren H0251 saw H7200 (8799) that their father H0001 was dead H4191 (8804), they said H0559 (8799), Joseph H3130 will peradventure H3863 hate us H7852 (8799), and will certainly H7725 (8687) requite H7725 (8686) us all the evil H7451 which we did H1580 (8804) unto him.
050:016 And they sent a messenger H6680 (8762) unto Joseph H3130, saying H0559 (8800), Thy father H0001 did command H6680 (8765) before H6440 he died H4194, saying H0559 (8800),
050:017 So shall ye say H0559 (8799) unto Joseph H3130, Forgive H5375 (8798), I pray thee H0577 now, the trespass H6588 of thy brethren H0251, and their sin H2403; for they did H1580 (8804) unto thee evil H7451: and now, we pray thee, forgive H5375 (8798) the trespass H6588 of the servants H5650 of the God H0430 of thy father H0001. And Joseph H3130 wept H1058 (8799) when they spake H1696 (8763) unto him.
050:018 And his brethren H0251 also went H3212 (8799) and fell down H5307 (8799) before his face H6440; and they said H0559 (8799), Behold, we [be] thy servants H5650.
050:019 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Fear H3372 (8799) not: for [am] I in the place of God H0430?
050:020 But as for you, ye thought H2803 (8804) evil H7451 against me; [but] God H0430 meant it H2803 (8804) unto good H2896, to H4616 bring to pass H6213 (8800), as [it is] this day H3117, to save H2421 much H7227 people H5971 alive H2421 (8687).
050:021 Now therefore fear H3372 (8799) ye not: I will nourish H3557 (8770) you, and your little ones H2945. And he comforted H5162 (8762) them, and spake H1696 (8762) kindly H3820 unto them.
050:022 And Joseph H3130 dwelt H3427 (8799) in Egypt H4714, he, and his father’s H0001 house H1004: and Joseph H3130 lived H2421 (8799) an hundred H3967 and ten H6235 years H8141.
050:023 And Joseph H3130 saw H7200 (8799) Ephraim’s H0669 children H1121 of the third H8029 [generation]: the children H1121 also of Machir H4353 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519 were brought up H3205 (8795) upon Joseph’s H3130 knees H1290.
050:024 And Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799) unto his brethren H0251, I die H4191 (8801): and God H0430 will surely H6485 (8800) visit H6485 (8799) you, and bring you out H5927 (8689) of this land H0776 unto the land H0776 which he sware H7650 (8738) to Abraham H0085, to Isaac H3327, and to Jacob H3290.
050:025 And Joseph H3130 took an oath H7650 (8686) of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), God H0430 will surely H6485 (8800) visit H6485 (8799) you, and ye shall carry up H5927 (8689) my bones H6106 from hence H2088.
050:026 So Joseph H3130 died H4191 (8799), [being] an hundred H3967 and ten H6235 years H8141 old H1121: and they embalmed H2590 (8799) him, and he was put H3455 (8799) in a coffin H0727 in Egypt H4714.
