001:001 ¶ Paul G3972, called G2822 [to be] an apostle G0652 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 through G1223 the will G2307 of God G2316, and G2532 Sosthenes G4988 [our] brother G0080,
001:002 Unto the church G1577 of God G2316 which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) at G1722 Corinth G2882, to them that are sanctified G0037 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424, called G2822 [to be] saints G0040, with G4862 all G3956 that in G1722 every G3956 place G5117 call upon G1941 (PresMidPtc) the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962, both G5037 theirs G0846 and G2532 ours G2257:
001:003 Grace G5485 [be] unto you G5213, and G2532 peace G1515, from G0575 God G2316 our G2257 Father G3962, and G2532 [from] the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
001:004 I thank G2168 (PresActInd) my G3450 God G2316 always G3842 on G4012 your G5216 behalf G4012, for G1909 the grace G5485 of God G2316 which G3588 is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) you G5213 by G1722 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547;
001:005 That G3754 in G1722 every thing G3956 ye are enriched G4148 (AorPasInd) by G1722 him G0846, in G1722 all G3956 utterance G3056, and G2532 [in] all G3956 knowledge G1108;
001:006 Even as G2531 the testimony G3142 of Christ G5547 was confirmed G0950 (AorPasInd) in G1722 you G5213:
001:007 So that G5620 ye G5209 come behind G5302 (PresPasInf) in G1722 no G3361 G3367 gift G5486; waiting for G0553 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the coming G0602 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547:
001:008 Who G3739 shall G0950 also G2532 confirm G0950 (FutActInd) you G5209 unto G2193 the end G5056, [that ye may be] blameless G0410 in G1722 the day G2250 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
001:009 God G2316 [is] faithful G4103, by G1223 whom G3739 ye were called G2564 (AorPasInd) unto G1519 the fellowship G2842 of his G0846 Son G5207 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962.
001:010 Now G1161 I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209, brethren G0080, by G1223 the name G3686 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, that G2443 ye G3004 all G3956 speak G3004 (PresActSubj) the same thing G0846, and G2532 [that] there be G5600 (PresSubj) no G3361 divisions G4978 among G1722 you G5213; but G1161 [that] ye be G5600 (PresSubj) perfectly joined together G2675 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the same G0846 mind G3563 and G2532 in G1722 the same G0846 judgment G1106.
001:011 For G1063 it hath been declared G1213 (AorPasInd) unto me G3427 of G4012 you G5216, my G3450 brethren G0080, by G5259 them [which are of the house G3588 ] of Chloe G5514, that G3754 there are G1526 (PresInd) contentions G2054 among G1722 you G5213.
001:012 Now G1161 this G5124 I say G3004 (PresActInd), that G3754 every one G1538 of you G5216 saith G3004 (PresActInd), I G1473 G3303 am G1510 (PresInd) of Paul G3972; and G1161 I G1473 of Apollos G0625; and G1161 I G1473 of Cephas G2786; and G1161 I G1473 of Christ G5547.
001:013 Is G3307 Christ G5547 divided G3307 (PerfPasInd)? G3361 was G4717 Paul G3972 crucified G4717 (AorPasInd) for G5228 you G5216? or G2228 were ye baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) in G1519 the name G3686 of Paul G3972?
001:014 I thank G2168 (PresActInd) God G2316 that G3754 I baptized G0907 (AorActInd) none G3762 of you G5216, but G1508 Crispus G2921 and G2532 Gaius G1050;
001:015 Lest G3363 any G5100 should say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) that G3754 I had baptized G0907 (AorActInd) in G1519 mine own G1699 name G3686.
001:016 And G1161 I baptized G0907 (AorActInd) also G2532 the household G3624 of Stephanas G4734: besides G3063, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 whether I baptized G0907 (AorActInd) any G1536 other G0243.
001:017 For G1063 Christ G5547 sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165 not G3756 to baptize G0907 (PresActInf), but G0235 to preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidInf): not G3756 with G1722 wisdom G4678 of words G3056, lest G3363 the cross G4716 of Christ G5547 should be made of none effect G2758 (AorPasSubj).
001:018 For G1063 the preaching G3056 of the cross G4716 is G2076 (PresInd) to them G3303 that perish G0622 (PresMidPasPtc) foolishness G3472; but G1161 unto us G2254 which are saved G4982 (PresPasPtc) it is G2076 (PresInd) the power G1411 of God G2316.
001:019 For G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), I will destroy G0622 (FutActInd) the wisdom G4678 of the wise G4680, and G2532 will bring to nothing G0114 (FutActInd) the understanding G4907 of the prudent G4908.
001:020 Where G4226 [is] the wise G4680? where G4226 [is] the scribe G1122? where G4226 [is] the disputer G4804 of this G5127 world G0165? hath G3471 not G3780 God G2316 made foolish G3471 (AorActInd) the wisdom G4678 of this G5127 world G2889?
001:021 For G1063 after G1894 that in G1722 the wisdom G4678 of God G2316 the world G2889 by G1223 wisdom G4678 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 God G2316, it pleased G2106 (AorActInd) God G2316 by G1223 the foolishness G3472 of preaching G2782 to save G4982 (AorActInf) them that believe G4100 (PresActPtc).
001:022 For G2532 G1894 the Jews G2453 require G0154 (PresActInd) a sign G4592, and G2532 the Greeks G1672 seek G2212 (PresActInd) after wisdom G4678:
001:023 But G1161 we G2249 preach G2784 (PresActInd) Christ G5547 crucified G4717 (PerfPasPtc), unto the Jews G2453 a stumblingblock G3303 G4625, and G1161 unto the Greeks G1672 foolishness G3472;
001:024 But G1161 unto them G0846 which G3588 are called G2822, both G5037 Jews G2453 and G2532 Greeks G1672, Christ G5547 the power G1411 of God G2316, and G2532 the wisdom G4678 of God G2316.
001:025 Because G3754 the foolishness G3474 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) wiser than G4680 men G0444; and G2532 the weakness G0772 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) stronger than G2478 men G0444.
001:026 For G1063 ye see G0991 (PresActInd) your G5216 calling G2821, brethren G0080, how that G3754 not G3756 many G4183 wise men G4680 after G2596 the flesh G4561, not G3756 many G4183 mighty G1415, not G3756 many G4183 noble G2104, [are called]:
001:027 But G0235 God G2316 hath chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) the foolish things G3474 of the world G2889 to G2443 confound G2617 (PresActSubj) the wise G4680; and G2532 God G2316 hath chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) the weak things G0772 of the world G2889 to G2443 confound G2617 (PresActSubj) the things which are mighty G2478;
001:028 And G2532 base things G0036 of the world G2889, and G2532 things which are despised G1848 (PerfPasPtc), hath G1586 God G2316 chosen G1586 (AorMidInd), [yea], and G2532 things which G3588 are G5607 (PresPtc) not G3361, to G2443 bring to nought G2673 (AorActSubj) things that are G5607 (PresPtc):
001:029 That G3704 no G3361 G3956 flesh G4561 should glory G2744 (AorMidDepSubj) in his presence G1799 G0846.
001:030 But G1161 of G1537 him G0846 are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210 in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424, who G3739 of G0575 God G2316 is made G1096 (AorPasDepInd) unto us G2254 G5037 wisdom G4678, and righteousness G1343, and G2532 sanctification G0038, and G2532 redemption G0629:
001:031 That G2443, according as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), He that glorieth G2744 (PresMidPasDepPtc), let him glory G2744 (PresMidPasDepImpr) in G1722 the Lord G2962.
002:001 ¶ And I G2504, brethren G0080, when I came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 you G5209, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 with G2596 excellency G5247 of speech G3056 or G2228 of wisdom G4678, declaring G2605 (PresActPtc) unto you G5213 the testimony G3142 of God G2316.
002:002 For G1063 I determined G2919 (AorActInd) not G3756 to know G1492 (PerfActInf) any thing G5100 among G1722 you G5213, save G1508 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, and G2532 him G5126 crucified G4717 (PerfPasPtc).
002:003 And G2532 I G1473 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) with G4314 you G5209 in G1722 weakness G0769, and G2532 in G1722 fear G5401, and G2532 in G1722 much G4183 trembling G5156.
002:004 And G2532 my G3450 speech G3056 and G2532 my G3450 preaching G2782 [was] not G3756 with G1722 enticing G3981 words G3056 of man’s G0442 wisdom G4678, but G0235 in G1722 demonstration G0585 of the Spirit G4151 and G2532 of power G1411:
002:005 That G2443 your G5216 faith G4102 should G5600 not G3361 stand G5600 (PresSubj) in G1722 the wisdom G4678 of men G0444, but G0235 in G1722 the power G1411 of God G2316.
002:006 Howbeit G1161 we speak G2980 (PresActInd) wisdom G4678 among G1722 them that are perfect G5046: yet G1161 not G3756 the wisdom G4678 of this G5127 world G0165, nor G3761 of the princes G0758 of this G5127 world G0165, that come to nought G2673 (PresPasPtc):
002:007 But G0235 we speak G2980 (PresActInd) the wisdom G4678 of God G2316 in G1722 a mystery G3466, [even] the hidden G0613 (PerfPasPtc) [wisdom], which G3739 God G2316 ordained G4309 (AorActInd) before G4253 the world G0165 unto G1519 our G2257 glory G1391:
002:008 Which G3739 none G3762 of the princes G0758 of this G5127 world G0165 knew G1097 (PerfActInd): for G1487 G1063 had they known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) [it], they G0302 would G4717 not G3756 have crucified G4717 (AorActInd) the Lord G2962 of glory G1391.
002:009 But G0235 as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3739 Eye G3788 hath G1492 not G3756 seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd), nor G2532 G3756 ear G3775 heard G0191 (AorActInd), neither G2532 G3756 have entered G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 the heart G2588 of man G0444, the things which G3739 God G2316 hath prepared G2090 (AorActInd) for them that love G0025 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
002:010 But G1161 God G2316 hath revealed G0601 (AorActInd) [them] unto us G2254 by G1223 his G0846 Spirit G4151: for G1063 the Spirit G4151 searcheth G2045 (PresActInd) all things G3956, yea G2532, the deep things G0899 of God G2316.
002:011 For G1063 what G5101 man G0444 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) the things G3588 of a man G0444, save G1508 the spirit G4151 of man G0444 which G3588 is in G1722 him G0846? even G2532 so G3779 the things G3588 of God G2316 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) no man G3762, but G1508 the Spirit G4151 of God G2316.
002:012 Now G1161 we G2249 have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd), not G3756 the spirit G4151 of the world G2889, but G0235 the spirit G4151 which G3588 is of G1537 God G2316; that G2443 we might know G1492 (PerfActSubj) the things that are freely given G5483 (AorPasPtc) to us G2254 of G5259 God G2316.
002:013 Which things G3739 also G2532 we speak G2980 (PresActInd), not G3756 in G1722 the words G3056 which man’s G0442 wisdom G4678 teacheth G1318, but G0235 which the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 teacheth G1722 G1318; comparing G4793 (PresActPtc) spiritual things G4152 with spiritual G4152.
002:014 But G1161 the natural G5591 man G0444 receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 the things G3588 of the Spirit G4151 of God G2316: for G1063 they are G2076 (PresInd) foolishness G3472 unto him G0846: neither G2532 G3756 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) he know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) [them], because G3754 they are spiritually G4153 discerned G0350 (PresPasInd).
002:015 But G1161 he that is spiritual G4152 judgeth G0350 (PresActInd) G3303 all things G3956, yet G1161 he himself G0846 is judged G0350 (PresPasInd) of G5259 no man G3762.
002:016 For G1063 who G5101 hath known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) the mind G3563 of the Lord G2962, that G3739 he may instruct G4822 (FutActInd) him G0846? But G1161 we G2249 have G2192 (PresActInd) the mind G3563 of Christ G5547.
003:001 ¶ And G2532 I G1473, brethren G0080, could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 speak G2980 (AorActInf) unto you G5213 as G5613 unto spiritual G4152, but G0235 as G5613 unto carnal G4559, [even] as G5613 unto babes G3516 in G1722 Christ G5547.
003:002 I have fed G4222 (AorActInd) you G5209 with milk G1051, and G2532 not G3756 with meat G1033: for G1063 hitherto G3768 ye were G1410 not G3768 able G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) [to bear it], neither G0235 G3777 yet G2089 now G3568 are ye able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd).
003:003 For G1063 ye are G2075 (PresInd) yet G2089 carnal G4559: for G1063 whereas G3699 [there is] among G1722 you G5213 envying G2205, and G2532 strife G2054, and G2532 divisions G1370, are ye G2075 (PresInd) not G3780 carnal G4559, and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActInd) as G2596 men G0444?
003:004 For G1063 while G3752 one G5100 saith G3004 (PresActSubj), I G1473 G3303 am G1510 (PresInd) of Paul G3972; and G1161 another G2087, I G1473 [am] of Apollos G0625; are G2075 ye (PresInd) not G3780 carnal G4559?
003:005 Who G5101 then G3767 is G2076 (PresInd) Paul G3972, and G1161 who G5101 [is] Apollos G0625, but G0235 G2228 ministers G1249 by G1223 whom G3739 ye believed G4100 (AorActInd), even G2532 as G5613 the Lord G2962 gave G1325 (AorActInd) to every man G1538?
003:006 I G1473 have planted G5452 (AorActInd), Apollos G0625 watered G4222 (AorActInd); but G0235 God G2316 gave the increase G0837 (ImpfActInd).
003:007 So G5620 then neither G3777 is G2076 (PresInd) he that planteth G5452 (PresActPtc) any thing G5100, neither G3777 he that watereth G4222 (PresActPtc); but G0235 God G2316 that giveth the increase G0837 (PresActPtc).
003:008 Now G1161 he that planteth G5452 (PresActPtc) and G2532 he that watereth G4222 (PresActPtc) are G1526 (PresInd) one G1520: and G1161 every man G1538 shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) his own G2398 reward G3408 according G2596 to his own G2398 labour G2873.
003:009 For G1063 we are G2070 (PresInd) labourers together G4904 with God G2316: ye are G2075 (PresInd) God’s G2316 husbandry G1091, [ye are] God’s G2316 building G3619.
003:010 According G2596 to the grace G5485 of God G2316 which G3588 is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) unto me G3427, as G5613 a wise G4680 masterbuilder G0753, I have laid G5087 (PerfActInd) the foundation G2310, and G1161 another G0243 buildeth G2026 (PresActInd) thereon. But G1161 let G0991 every man G1538 take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) how G4459 he buildeth G2026 (PresActInd) thereupon.
003:011 For G1063 other G0243 foundation G2310 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) no man G3762 lay G5087 (Aor2ActInf) than G3844 that is laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc), which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
003:012 Now G1161 if any man G1536 build G2026 (PresActInd) upon G1909 this G5126 foundation G2310 gold G5557, silver G0696, precious G5093 stones G3037, wood G3586, hay G5528, stubble G2562;
003:013 Every man’s G1538 work G2041 shall be made G1096 (FutMidDepInd) manifest G5318: for G1063 the day G2250 shall declare G1213 (FutActInd) it, because G3754 it shall be revealed G0601 (PresPasInd) by G1722 fire G4442; and G2532 the fire G4442 shall try G1381 (FutActInd) every man’s G1538 work G2041 of what sort G3697 it is G2076 (PresInd).
003:014 If any man’s G1536 work G2041 abide G3306 (PresActInd) which G3739 he hath built G2026 (AorActInd) thereupon, he shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) a reward G3408.
003:015 If any man’s G1536 work G2041 shall be burned G2618 (Fut2PasInd), he shall suffer loss G2210 (FutPasInd): but G1161 he himself G0846 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd); yet G1161 so G3779 as G5613 by G1223 fire G4442.
003:016 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) the temple G3485 of God G2316, and G2532 [that] the Spirit G4151 of God G2316 dwelleth G3611 (PresActInd) in G1722 you G5213?
003:017 If any man G1536 defile G5351 (PresActInd) the temple G3485 of God G2316, him G5126 shall G5351 God G2316 destroy G5351 (FutActInd); for G1063 the temple G3485 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) holy G0040, which G3748 [temple] ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd).
003:018 Let G1818 no man G3367 deceive G1818 (PresActImpr) himself G1438. If any man G1536 among G1722 you G5213 seemeth G1380 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) wise G4680 in G1722 this G5129 world G0165, let him become G1096 (Aor2MidDepImpr) a fool G3474, that G2443 he may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) wise G4680.
003:019 For G1063 the wisdom G4678 of this G5127 world G2889 is G2076 (PresInd) foolishness G3472 with G3844 God G2316. For G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), He taketh G1405 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the wise G4680 in G1722 their own G0846 craftiness G3834.
003:020 And G2532 again G3825, The Lord G2962 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) the thoughts G1261 of the wise G4680, that G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) vain G3152.
003:021 Therefore G5620 let G2744 no man G3367 glory G2744 (PresMidPasDepImpr) in G1722 men G0444. For G1063 all things G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) yours G5216;
003:022 Whether G1535 Paul G3972, or G1535 Apollos G0625, or G1535 Cephas G2786, or G1535 the world G2889, or G1535 life G2222, or G1535 death G2288, or G1535 things present G1764 (PerfActPtc), or G1535 things to come G3195 (PresActPtc); all G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) yours G5216;
003:023 And G1161 ye G5210 are Christ’s G5547; and G1161 Christ G5547 [is] God’s G2316.
004:001 ¶ Let G3049 a man G0444 so G3779 account G3049 (PresMidPasDepImpr) of us G2248, as G5613 of the ministers G5257 of Christ G5547, and G2532 stewards G3623 of the mysteries G3466 of God G2316.
004:002  G3739 G1161 Moreover G3063 it is required G2212 (PresPasInd) in G1722 stewards G3623, that G2443 a man G5100 be found G2147 (AorPasSubj) faithful G4103.
004:003 But G1161 with me G1698 it is G2076 (PresInd) a very small thing G1519 G1646 that G2443 I should be judged G0350 (AorPasSubj) of G5259 you G5216, or G2228 of G5259 man’s G0442 judgment G2250: yea G0235, I judge G0350 (PresActInd) not G3761 mine own self G1683.
004:004 For G1063 I know G4894 (PerfActInd) nothing G3762 by myself G1683; yet G0235 am I G1344 not G3756 hereby G1722 G5129 justified G1344 (PerfPasInd): but G1161 he that judgeth G0350 (PresActPtc) me G3165 is G2076 (PresInd) the Lord G2962.
004:005 Therefore G5620 judge G2919 (PresActImpr) nothing G3361 G5100 before G4253 the time G2540, until G2193 G0302 the Lord G2962 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), who G3739 both G2532 will bring to light G5461 (FutActInd) the hidden things G2927 of darkness G4655, and G2532 will make manifest G5319 (FutActInd) the counsels G1012 of the hearts G2588: and G2532 then G5119 shall every man G1538 have G1096 (FutMidDepInd) praise G1868 of G0575 God G2316.
004:006 And G1161 these things G5023, brethren G0080, I have in a figure transferred G3345 (AorActInd) to G1519 myself G1683 and G2532 [to] Apollos G0625 for G1223 your sakes G5209; that G2443 ye might learn G3129 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 us G2254 not G3361 to think G5426 (PresActInf) [of men] above G5228 that G2443 which G3739 is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), that no G3363 one G1520 of you be puffed up G5448 (PresPasSubj) for G5228 one G1520 against G2596 another G2087.
004:007 For G1063 who G5101 maketh G1252 thee G4571 to differ G1252 (PresActInd) [from another]? and G1161 what G5101 hast thou G2192 (PresActInd) that G3739 thou didst G2983 not G3756 receive G2983 (Aor2ActInd)? G1161 now if G1499 thou didst receive G2983 (Aor2ActInd) [it], why G5101 dost thou glory G2744 (PresMidPasDepInd), as G5613 if thou hadst G2983 not G3361 received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) [it]?
004:008 Now G2235 ye are G2075 (PresInd) full G2880 (PerfPasPtc), now G2235 ye are rich G4147 (AorActInd), ye have reigned as kings G0936 (AorActInd) without G5565 us G2257: and G2532 I would to God G3785 G1065 ye did reign G0936 (AorActInd), that G2443 we G2249 also G2532 might reign with G4821 (AorActSubj) you G5213.
004:009 For G1063 I think G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 God G2316 hath set forth G0584 (AorActInd) us G2248 the apostles G0652 last G2078, as G5613 it were appointed to death G1935: for G3754 we are made G1096 (AorPasDepInd) a spectacle G2302 unto the world G2889, and G2532 to angels G0032, and G2532 to men G0444.
004:010 We G2249 [are] fools G3474 for G1223 Christ’s G5547 sake G1223, but G1161 ye G5210 [are] wise G5429 in G1722 Christ G5547; we G2249 [are] weak G0772, but G1161 ye G5210 [are] strong G2478; ye G5210 [are] honourable G1741, but G1161 we G2249 [are] despised G0820.
004:011 Even G0891 unto this present G0737 hour G5610 we G3983 both G2532 hunger G3983 (PresActInd), and G2532 thirst G1372 (PresActSubj), and G2532 are naked G1130 (PresActInd), and G2532 are buffeted G2852 (PresPasInd), and G2532 have no certain dwellingplace G0790 (PresActInd);
004:012 And G2532 labour G2872 (PresActInd), working G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with our own G2398 hands G5495: being reviled G3058 (PresPasPtc), we bless G2127 (PresActInd); being persecuted G1377 (PresPasPtc), we suffer it G0430 (PresMidPasDepInd):
004:013 Being defamed G0987 (PresPasPtc), we intreat G3870 (PresActInd): we are made G1096 (AorPasDepInd) as G5613 the filth G4027 of the world G2889, [and are] the offscouring G4067 of all things G3956 unto G2193 this day G0737.
004:014 I write G1125 (PresActInd) not G3756 these things G5023 to shame G1788 (PresActPtc) you G5209, but G0235 as G5613 my G3450 beloved G0027 sons G5043 I warn G3560 (PresActInd) [you].
004:015 For G1063 though G1437 ye have G2192 (PresActSubj) ten thousand G3463 instructors G3807 in G1722 Christ G5547, yet G0235 [have ye] not G3756 many G4183 fathers G3962: for G1063 in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424 I G1473 have begotten G1080 (AorActInd) you G5209 through G1223 the gospel G2098.
004:016 Wherefore G3767 I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209, be ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) followers G3402 of me G3450.
004:017 For G1223 this G5124 cause G1223 have I sent G3992 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 Timotheus G5095, who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 son G5043, and G2532 faithful G4103 in G1722 the Lord G2962, who G3739 shall bring G0363 you G5209 into remembrance G0363 (FutActInd) of my G3450 ways G3598 which G3588 be in G1722 Christ G5547, as G2531 I teach G1321 (PresActInd) every where G3837 in G1722 every G3956 church G1577.
004:018 Now G1161 some G5100 are puffed up G5448 (AorPasInd), as though G5613 I G3450 would G2064 not G3361 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 you G5209.
004:019 But G1161 I will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) to G4314 you G5209 shortly G5030, if G1437 the Lord G2962 will G2309 (AorActSubj), and G2532 will know G1097 (FutMidDepInd), not G3756 the speech G3056 of them which are puffed up G5448 (PerfPasPtc), but G0235 the power G1411.
004:020 For G1063 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 [is] not G3756 in G1722 word G3056, but G0235 in G1722 power G1411.
004:021 What G5101 will ye G2309 (PresActInd)? shall I come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209 with G1722 a rod G4464, or G2228 in G1722 love G0026, and G5037 [in] the spirit G4151 of meekness G4236?
005:001 ¶ It is reported G0191 (PresPasInd) commonly G3654 [that there is] fornication G4202 among G1722 you G5213, and G2532 such G5108 fornication G4202 as G3748 is G3687 not so much G3761 as named G3687 (PresPasInd) among G1722 the Gentiles G1484, that G5620 one G5100 should have G2192 (PresActInf) his father’s G3962 wife G1135.
005:002 And G2532 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) puffed up G5448 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 have G3996 not G3780 rather G3123 mourned G3996 (AorActInd), that G2443 he that hath done G4160 (AorActPtc) this G5124 deed G2041 might be taken away G1808 (AorPasSubj) from G1537 among G3319 you G5216.
005:003 For G1063 I G1473 verily G3303, as G5613 absent G0548 (PresPtc) in body G4983, but G1161 present G3918 (PresPtc) in spirit G4151, have judged G2919 (PerfActInd) already G2235, as G5613 though I were present G3918 (PresPtc), [concerning] him that hath G2716 so G3779 done G2716 (AorMidDepPtc) this deed G5124,
005:004 In G1722 the name G3686 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, when ye G5216 are gathered together G4863 (AorPasPtc), and G2532 my G1699 spirit G4151, with G4862 the power G1411 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547,
005:005 To deliver G3860 (Aor2ActInf) such an one G5108 unto Satan G4567 for G1519 the destruction G3639 of the flesh G4561, that G2443 the spirit G4151 may be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the day G2250 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
005:006 Your G5216 glorying G2745 [is] not G3756 good G2570. Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 a little G3398 leaven G2219 leaveneth G2220 (PresActInd) the whole G3650 lump G5445?
005:007 Purge out G1571 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 the old G3820 leaven G2219, that G2443 ye may be G5600 (PresSubj) a new G3501 lump G5445, as G2531 ye are G2075 (PresInd) unleavened G0106. For G1063 even G2532 Christ G5547 our G2257 passover G3957 is sacrificed G2380 (AorPasInd) for G5228 us G2257:
005:008 Therefore G5620 let us keep the feast G1858 (PresActSubj), not G3361 with G1722 old G3820 leaven G2219, neither G3366 with G1722 the leaven G2219 of malice G2549 and G2532 wickedness G4189; but G0235 with G1722 the unleavened G0106 [bread] of sincerity G1505 and G2532 truth G0225.
005:009 I wrote G1125 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 in G1722 an epistle G1992 not G3361 to company G4874 (PresMidInf) with fornicators G4205:
005:010 Yet G2532 not G3756 altogether G3843 with the fornicators G4205 of this G5127 world G2889, or G2228 with the covetous G4123, or G2228 extortioners G0727, or G2228 with idolaters G1496; for G1893 then G0686 must ye needs G3784 (PresActInd) go G1831 (Aor2ActInf) out of G1537 the world G2889.
005:011 But G1161 now G3570 I have written G1125 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 not G3361 to keep company G4874 (PresMidInf), if G1437 any man G5100 that is called G3687 (PresPasPtc) a brother G0080 be G2228 a fornicator G4205, or G2228 covetous G4123, or G2228 an idolater G1496, or G2228 a railer G3060, or G2228 a drunkard G3183, or G2228 an extortioner G0727; with such an one G5108 no not G3366 to eat G4906 (PresActInf).
005:012 For G1063 what G5101 have I G3427 to do to judge G2919 (PresActInf) them also G2532 that are without G1854? do G2919 not G3780 ye G5210 judge G2919 (PresActInd) them that are within G2080?
005:013 But G1161 them that are without G1854 God G2316 judgeth G2919 (FutActInd). Therefore G2532 put away G1808 (FutActInd) from G1537 among yourselves G5216 that G0846 wicked person G4190.
006:001 ¶ Dare G5111 (PresActInd) any G5100 of you G5216, having G2192 (PresActPtc) a matter G4229 against G4314 another G2087, go to law G2919 (PresPasInf) before G1909 the unjust G0094, and G2532 not G3780 before G1909 the saints G0040?
006:002 Do ye G1492 not G3756 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the saints G0040 shall judge G2919 (FutActInd) the world G2889? and G2532 if G1487 the world G2889 shall be judged G2919 (PresPasInd) by G1722 you G5213, are ye G2075 (PresInd) unworthy G0370 to judge G2922 the smallest matters G1646?
006:003 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 we shall judge G2919 (FutActInd) angels G0032? how much more G3386 G1065 things that pertain to this life G0982?
006:004 If G1437 then G3303 G3767 ye have G2192 (PresActSubj) judgments G2922 of things pertaining to this life G0982, set G2523 (PresActInd) them G5128 to judge who are least esteemed G1848 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the church G1577.
006:005 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) to G4314 your G5213 shame G1791. Is it so G3779, that there G2076 (PresInd) is not G3756 a wise man G4680 among G1722 you G5213? no, not G3761 one G1520 that G3739 shall be able G1410 (FutMidDepInd) to judge G1252 (AorActInf) between G0303 G3319 his G0846 brethren G0080?
006:006 But G0235 brother G0080 goeth to law G2919 (PresPasInd) with G3326 brother G0080, and G2532 that G5124 before G1909 the unbelievers G0571.
006:007 Now G2235 therefore G3303 G3767 there is G2076 (PresInd) utterly G3654 a fault G2275 among G1722 you G5213, because G3754 ye go G2192 (PresActInd) to law G2917 one with G3326 another G1438. Why G1302 do ye G0091 not G3780 rather G3123 take wrong G0091 (PresPasInd)? why G1302 do ye G0650 not G3780 rather G3123 [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded G0650 (PresPasInd)?
006:008 Nay G0235, ye G5210 do wrong G0091 (PresActInd), and G2532 defraud G0650 (PresActInd), and G2532 that G5023 [your] brethren G0080.
006:009  G2228 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 the unrighteous G0094 shall G2816 not G3756 inherit G2816 (FutActInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316? Be G4105 not G3361 deceived G4105 (PresPasImpr): neither G3777 fornicators G4205, nor G3777 idolaters G1496, nor G3777 adulterers G3432, nor G3777 effeminate G3120, nor G3777 abusers of themselves with mankind G0733,
006:010 Nor G3777 thieves G2812, nor G3777 covetous G4123, nor G3777 drunkards G3183, nor G3756 revilers G3060, nor G3756 extortioners G0727, shall inherit G3756 G2816 (FutActInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
006:011 And G2532 such G5023 were G2258 (ImpfInd) some of you G5100: but G0235 ye are washed G0628 (AorMidInd), but G0235 ye are sanctified G0037 (AorPasInd), but G0235 ye are justified G1344 (AorPasInd) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, and G2532 by G1722 the Spirit G4151 of our G2257 God G2316.
006:012 All things G3956 are lawful G1832 (PresInd) unto me G3427, but G0235 all things G3956 are G4851 not G3756 expedient G4851 (PresActInd): all things G3956 are lawful G1832 (PresInd) for me G3427, but G0235 I G1473 will G1850 not G3756 be brought under the power G1850 (FutPasInd) of G5259 any G5100.
006:013 Meats G1033 for the belly G2836, and G2532 the belly G2836 for meats G1033: but G1161 God G2316 shall destroy G2673 (FutActInd) both G2532 it G5026 and G2532 them G5023. Now G1161 the body G4983 [is] not G3756 for fornication G4202, but G0235 for the Lord G2962; and G2532 the Lord G2962 for the body G4983.
006:014 And G1161 God G2316 hath G1453 both G2532 raised up G1453 (AorActInd) the Lord G2962, and G2532 will G1825 also G2532 raise up G1825 (FutActInd) us G2248 by G1223 his own G0846 power G1411.
006:015 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 your G5216 bodies G4983 are G2076 (PresInd) the members G3196 of Christ G5547? shall I G0142 then G3767 take G0142 (AorActPtc) the members G3196 of Christ G5547, and make G4160 (AorActSubj) [them] the members G3196 of an harlot G4204? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt).
006:016 What G2228? know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 he which is joined G2853 (PresPasPtc) to an harlot G4204 is G2076 (PresInd) one G1520 body G4983? for G1063 two G1417, saith he G5346 (PresInd), shall be G2071 (FutInd) one G1519 G3391 flesh G4561.
006:017 But G1161 he that is joined G2853 (PresPasPtc) unto the Lord G2962 is G2076 (PresInd) one G1520 spirit G4151.
006:018 Flee G5343 (PresActImpr) fornication G4202. Every G3956 sin G0265 that G3739 G1437 a man G0444 doeth G4160 (AorActSubj) is G2076 (PresInd) without G1622 the body G4983; but G1161 he that committeth fornication G4203 (PresActPtc) sinneth G0264 (PresActInd) against G1519 his own G2398 body G4983.
006:019 What G2228? know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 your G5216 body G4983 is G2076 (PresInd) the temple G3485 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 [which is] in G1722 you G5213, which G3739 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) of G0575 God G2316, and G2532 ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 your own G1438?
006:020 For G1063 ye are bought G0059 (AorPasInd) with a price G5092: therefore G1211 glorify G1392 (AorActImpr) God G2316 in G1722 your G5216 body G4983, and G2532 in G1722 your G5216 spirit G4151, which G3748 are G2076 (PresInd) God’s G2316.
007:001 ¶ Now G1161 concerning G4012 the things whereof G3739 ye wrote G1125 (AorActInd) unto me G3427: [It is] good G2570 for a man G0444 not G3361 to touch G0680 (PresMidInf) a woman G1135.
007:002 Nevertheless G1223 G1161, [to avoid] fornication G4202, let G2192 every man G1538 have G2192 (PresActImpr) his own G1438 wife G1135, and G2532 let G2192 every woman G1538 have G2192 (PresActImpr) her own G2398 husband G0435.
007:003 Let G0591 the husband G0435 render G0591 (PresActImpr) unto the wife G1135 due G3784 (PresPasPtc) benevolence G2133: and G1161 likewise G3668 also G2532 the wife G1135 unto the husband G0435.
007:004 The wife G1135 hath G1850 not G3756 power G1850 (PresActInd) of her own G2398 body G4983, but G0235 the husband G0435: and G1161 likewise G3668 also G2532 the husband G0435 hath G1850 not G3756 power G1850 (PresActInd) of his own G2398 body G4983, but G0235 the wife G1135.
007:005 Defraud ye G0650 (PresActImpr) not G3361 one the other G0240, except G1509 G0302 [it be] G5100 with G1537 consent G4859 for G4314 a time G2540, that G2443 ye may give yourselves G4980 (PresActSubj) to fasting G3521 and G2532 prayer G4335; and G2532 come G4905 (PresMidPasDepSubj) together G1909 G0846 again G3825, that G3363 Satan G4567 tempt G3985 (PresActSubj) you G5209 not G3363 for G1223 your G5216 incontinency G0192.
007:006 But G1161 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) this G5124 by G2596 permission G4774, [and] not G3756 of G2596 commandment G2003.
007:007 For G1063 I would G2309 (PresActInd) that all G3956 men G0444 were G1511 (PresInf) even G2532 as G5613 I myself G1683. But G0235 every man G1538 hath G2192 (PresActInd) his proper G2398 gift G5486 of G1537 God G2316, one G3739 G3303 after this manner G3779, and G1161 another G3739 after that G3779.
007:008 I say G3004 (PresActInd) therefore G1161 to the unmarried G0022 and G2532 widows G5503, It is G2076 (PresInd) good G2570 for them G0846 if G1437 they abide G3306 (AorActSubj) even G2504 as G5613 I G2504.
007:009 But G1161 if G1487 they G1467 cannot G3756 contain G1467 (PresMidPasDepInd), let them marry G1060 (AorActImpr): for G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2909 to marry G1060 (AorActInf) than G2228 to burn G4448 (PresPasInf).
007:010 And G1161 unto the married G1060 (PerfActPtc) I command G3853 (PresActInd), [yet] not G3756 I G1473, but G0235 the Lord G2962, Let G5563 not G3361 the wife G1135 depart G5563 (AorPasInf) from G0575 [her] husband G0435:
007:011 But G1161 and G2532 if G1437 she depart G5563 (AorPasInd), let her remain G3306 (PresActImpr) unmarried G0022, or G2228 be reconciled G2644 (Aor2PasImpr) to [her] husband G0435: and G2532 let G0863 not G3361 the husband G0435 put away G0863 (PresActInf) [his] wife G1135.
007:012 But G1161 to the rest G3062 speak G3004 (PresActInd) I G1473, not G3756 the Lord G2962: If any G1536 brother G0080 hath G2192 (PresActInd) a wife G1135 that believeth not G0571, and G2532 she G0846 be pleased G4909 (PresActInd) to dwell G3611 (PresActInf) with G3326 him G0846, let him G0863 not G3361 put G0863 her G0846 away G0863 (PresActImpr).
007:013 And G2532 the woman G1135 which G3748 hath G2192 (PresActInd) an husband G0435 that believeth not G0571, and G2532 if he G0846 be pleased G4909 (PresActInd) to dwell G3611 (PresActInf) with G3326 her G0846, let her G0863 not G3361 leave G0863 (PresActImpr) him G0846.
007:014 For G1063 the unbelieving G0571 husband G0435 is sanctified G0037 (PerfPasInd) by G1722 the wife G1135, and G2532 the unbelieving G0571 wife G1135 is sanctified G0037 (PerfPasInd) by G1722 the husband G0435: else G0686 G1893 were G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 children G5043 unclean G0169; but G1161 now G3568 are they G2076 (PresInd) holy G0040.
007:015 But G1161 if G1487 the unbelieving G0571 depart G5563 (PresMidInd), let him depart G5563 (PresPasImpr). A brother G0080 or G2228 a sister G0079 is G1402 not G3756 under bondage G1402 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 such G5108 [cases]: but G1161 God G2316 hath called G2564 (PerfActInd) us G2248 to G1722 peace G1515.
007:016 For G1063 what G5101 knowest thou G1492 (PerfActInd), O wife G1135, whether G1487 thou shalt save G4982 (FutActInd) [thy] husband G0435? or G2228 how G5101 knowest thou G1492 (PerfActInd), O man G0435, whether G1487 thou shalt save G4982 (FutActInd) [thy] wife G1135?
007:017 But G1508 as G5613 God G2316 hath distributed G3307 (AorActInd) to every man G1538, as G5613 the Lord G2962 hath called G2564 (PerfActInd) every one G1538, so G3779 let him walk G4043 (PresActImpr). And G2532 so G3779 ordain I G1299 (PresMidInd) in G1722 all G3956 churches G1577.
007:018 Is G2564 any man G5100 called G2564 (AorPasInd) being circumcised G4059 (PerfPasPtc)? let him G1986 not G3361 become uncircumcised G1986 (PresMidPasDepImpr). Is G2564 any G5100 called G2564 (AorPasInd) in G1722 uncircumcision G0203? let him G4059 not G3361 be circumcised G4059 (PresPasImpr).
007:019 Circumcision G4061 is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762, and G2532 uncircumcision G0203 is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762, but G0235 the keeping G5084 of the commandments G1785 of God G2316.
007:020 Let G3306 every man G1538 abide G3306 (PresActImpr) in G1722 the same G5026 calling G2821 wherein G1722 G3739 he was called G2564 (AorPasInd).
007:021 Art thou called G2564 (AorPasInd) [being] a servant G1401? care G3199 G4671 not G3361 for it G3199 (PresActImpr): but G0235 if G1499 thou mayest G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) free G1658, use G5530 (AorMidDepImpr) [it] rather G3123.
007:022 For G1063 he that is called G2564 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 the Lord G2962, [being] a servant G1401, is G2076 (PresInd) the Lord’s G2962 freeman G0558: likewise G3668 also G2532 he that is called G2564 (AorPasPtc), [being] free G1658, is G2076 (PresInd) Christ’s G5547 servant G1401.
007:023 Ye are bought G0059 (AorPasInd) with a price G5092; be G1096 not G3361 ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) the servants G1401 of men G0444.
007:024 Brethren G0080, let G3306 every man G1538, wherein G1722 G3739 he is called G2564 (AorPasInd), therein G1722 G5129 abide G3306 (PresActImpr) with G3844 God G2316.
007:025 Now G1161 concerning G4012 virgins G3933 I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 commandment G2003 of the Lord G2962: yet G1161 I give G1325 (PresActInd) my judgment G1106, as G5613 one that hath obtained mercy G1653 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 the Lord G2962 to be G1511 (PresInf) faithful G4103.
007:026 I suppose G3543 (PresActInd) therefore G3767 that this G5124 is G5225 (PresActInf) good G2570 for G1223 the present G1764 (PerfActPtc) distress G0318, [I say], that G3754 [it is] good G2570 for a man G0444 so G3779 to be G1511 (PresInf).
007:027 Art thou bound G1210 (PerfPasInd) unto a wife G1135? seek G2212 (PresActImpr) not G3361 to be loosed G3080. Art thou loosed G3089 (PerfPasInd) from G0575 a wife G1135? seek G2212 (PresActImpr) not G3361 a wife G1135.
007:028 But G1161 and G2532 if G1437 thou marry G1060 (AorActSubj), thou hast G0264 not G3756 sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 if G1437 a virgin G3933 marry G1060 (AorActSubj), she hath G0264 not G3756 sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd). Nevertheless G1161 such G5108 shall have G2192 (FutActInd) trouble G2347 in the flesh G4561: but G1161 I G1473 spare G5339 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5216.
007:029 But G1161 this G5124 I say G5346 (PresInd), brethren G0080, the time G2540 [is] short G4958 (PerfPasPtc): it remaineth G2076 (PresInd) G3063, that G2443 both G2532 they that have G2192 (PresActPtc) wives G1135 be G5600 (PresSubj) as though G5613 they had G2192 (PresActPtc) none G3361;
007:030 And G2532 they that weep G2799 (PresActPtc), as G5613 though they wept G2799 (PresActPtc) not G3361; and G2532 they that rejoice G5463 (PresActPtc), as G5613 though they rejoiced G5463 (PresActPtc) not G3361; and G2532 they that buy G0059 (PresActPtc), as G5613 though they possessed G2722 (PresActPtc) not G3361;
007:031 And G2532 they that use G5530 (PresMidPasDepPtc) this G5127 world G2889, as G5613 not G3361 abusing G2710 (PresMidPasDepPtc) [it]: for G1063 the fashion G4976 of this G5129 world G2889 passeth away G3855 (PresActInd).
007:032 But G1161 I would have G1511 (PresInf) G2309 (PresActInd) you G5209 without carefulness G0275. He that is unmarried G0022 careth G3309 (PresActInd) for the things that belong to G3588 the Lord G2962, how G4459 he may please G0700 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962:
007:033 But G1161 he that is married G1060 (AorActPtc) careth G3309 (PresActInd) for the things that are G3588 of the world G2889, how G4459 he may please G0700 (FutActInd) [his] wife G1135.
007:034 There is difference [also] between G3307 (PerfPasInd) a wife G1135 and G2532 a virgin G3933. The unmarried woman G0022 careth for G3309 (PresActInd) the things G3588 of the Lord G2962, that G2443 she may be G5600 (PresSubj) holy G0040 both G2532 in body G4983 and G2532 in spirit G4151: but G1161 she that is married G1060 (AorActPtc) careth G3309 (PresActInd) for the things G3588 of the world G2889, how G4459 she may please G0700 (FutActInd) [her] husband G0435.
007:035 And G1161 this G5124 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) for G4314 your G5216 own G0846 profit G4851 (PresActPtc); not G3756 that G2443 I may cast G1911 (Aor2ActSubj) a snare G1029 upon you G5213, but G0235 for that which G4314 is comely G2158, and G2532 that ye may attend upon G2145 the Lord G2962 without distraction G0563.
007:036 But G1161 if any man G1536 think G3543 (PresActInd) that he behaveth himself uncomely G0807 (PresActInf) toward G1909 his G0846 virgin G3933, if G1437 she pass the flower of [her] age G5230 G5600 (PresSubj), and G2532 need G3784 (PresActInd) so G3779 require G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf), let him do G4160 (PresActImpr) what G3739 he will G2309 (PresActInd), he sinneth G0264 (PresActInd) not G3756: let them marry G1060 (PresActImpr).
007:037 Nevertheless G1161 he G3739 that standeth G2476 (ImpfActInd/PerfActInd) stedfast G1476 in G1722 his heart G2588, having G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 necessity G0318, but G1161 hath G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 over G4012 his own G2398 will G2307, and G2532 hath G2919 so G5124 decreed G2919 (PerfActInd) in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588 that he will keep G5083 (PresActInf) his G1438 virgin G3933, doeth G4160 (PresActInd) well G2573.
007:038 So G5620 then G2532 he that giveth [her] in marriage G1547 (PresActPtc) doeth G4160 (PresActInd) well G2573; but G1161 he that giveth [her] G1547 not G3361 in marriage G1547 (PresActPtc) doeth G4160 (PresActInd) better G2908.
007:039 The wife G1135 is bound G1210 (PerfPasInd) by the law G3551 G1909 as long G5550 as G3745 her G0846 husband G0435 liveth G2198 (PresActInd); but G1161 if G1437 her G0846 husband G0435 be dead G2837 (AorPasSubj), she is G2076 (PresInd) at liberty G1658 to be married G1060 (AorPasInf) to whom G3739 she will G2309 (PresActInd); only G3440 in G1722 the Lord G2962.
007:040 But G1161 she is G2076 (PresInd) happier G3107 if G1437 she G3306 so G3779 abide G3306 (AorActSubj), after G2596 my G1699 judgment G1106: and G1161 I think G1380 (PresActInd) also G2504 that I have G2192 (PresActInf) the Spirit G4151 of God G2316.
008:001 ¶ Now G1161 as touching G4012 things offered unto idols G1494, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 we all G3956 have G2192 (PresActInd) knowledge G1108. Knowledge G1108 puffeth up G5448 (PresActInd), but G1161 charity G0026 edifieth G3618 (PresActInd).
008:002 And G1161 if any man G1536 think G1380 (PresActInd) that he knoweth G1492 (PerfActInf) any thing G5100, he knoweth G1097 (PerfActInd) nothing G3762 yet G3764 as G2531 he ought G1163 (PresInd) to know G1097 (Aor2ActInf).
008:003 But G1161 if any man G1536 love G0025 (PresActInd) God G2316, the same G3778 is known G1097 (PerfPasInd) of G5259 him G0846.
008:004 As concerning G4012 therefore G3767 the eating G1035 of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols G1494, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 an idol G1497 [is] nothing G3762 in G1722 the world G2889, and G2532 that G3754 [there is] none G3762 other G2087 God G2316 but G1508 one G1520.
008:005 For G1063 though G1512 G2532 there be G1526 (PresInd) that are called G3004 (PresPasPtc) gods G2316, whether G1535 in G1722 heaven G3772 or G1535 in G1909 earth G1093, (as G5618 there be G1526 (PresInd) gods G2316 many G4183, and G2532 lords G2962 many G4183,)
008:006 But G0235 to us G2254 [there is but] one G1520 God G2316, the Father G3962, of G1537 whom G3739 [are] all things G3956, and G2532 we G2249 in G1519 him G0846; and G2532 one G1520 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, by G1223 whom G3739 [are] all things G3956, and G2532 we G2249 by G1223 him G0846.
008:007 Howbeit G0235 [there is] not G3756 in G1722 every man G3956 that knowledge G1108: for G1161 some G5100 with conscience G4893 of the idol G1497 unto G2193 this hour G0737 eat G2068 (PresActInd) [it] as G5613 a thing offered unto an idol G1494; and G2532 their G0846 conscience G4893 being G5607 (PresPtc) weak G0772 is defiled G3435 (PresPasInd).
008:008 But G1161 meat G1033 commendeth G3936 (PresActInd) us G2248 not G3756 to God G2316: for G1063 neither G3777, if G1437 we eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj), are we the better G4052 (PresActInd); neither G3777, if G3362 we eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3362, are we the worse G5302 (PresPasInd).
008:009 But G1161 take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) lest G3381 by any means G4458 this G3778 liberty G1849 of yours G5216 become G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) a stumblingblock G4348 to them that are weak G0770 (PresActPtc).
008:010 For G1063 if G1437 any man G5100 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) thee G4571 which G3588 hast G2192 (PresActPtc) knowledge G1108 sit at meat G2621 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the idol’s temple G1493, shall G3618 not G3780 the conscience G4893 of him G0846 which is G5607 (PresPtc) weak G0772 be emboldened G3618 (FutPasInd) G1519 to eat G2068 (PresActInf) those things which are offered to idols G1494;
008:011 And G2532 through G1909 thy G4674 knowledge G1108 shall G0622 the weak G0770 (PresActPtc) brother G0080 perish G0622 (Fut2MidInd), for G1223 whom G3739 Christ G5547 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd)?
008:012 But G1161 when ye sin G0264 (PresActPtc) so G3779 against G1519 the brethren G0080, and G2532 wound G5180 (PresActPtc) their G0846 weak G0770 (PresActPtc) conscience G4893, ye sin G0264 (PresActInd) against G1519 Christ G5547.
008:013 Wherefore G1355, if G1487 meat G1033 make G4624 my G3450 brother G0080 to offend G4624 (PresActInd), I will eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) no G3364 flesh G2907 while the world standeth G1519 G0165, lest G3363 I make G4624 my G3450 brother G0080 to offend G4624 (AorActSubj).
009:001 ¶ Am G1510 (PresInd) I not G3756 an apostle G0652? am G1510 (PresInd) I not G3756 free G1658? have I not G3780 seen G3708 (PerfActInd) Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962? are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 ye G5210 my G3450 work G2041 in G1722 the Lord G2962?
009:002 If G1487 I be G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 an apostle G0652 unto others G0243, yet G0235 doubtless G1065 I am G1510 (PresInd) to you G5213: for G1063 the seal G4973 of mine G1699 apostleship G0651 are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210 in G1722 the Lord G2962.
009:003 Mine G1699 answer G0627 to them that do examine G0350 (PresActPtc) me G1691 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778,
009:004 Have we G2192 (PresActInd) not G3378 power G1849 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) and G2532 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf)?
009:005 Have we G2192 (PresActInd) not G3378 power G1849 to lead about G4013 (PresActInf) a sister G0079, a wife G1135, as well as G5613 G2532 other G3062 apostles G0652, and G2532 [as] the brethren G0080 of the Lord G2962, and G2532 Cephas G2786?
009:006 Or G2228 I G1473 only G3441 and G2532 Barnabas G0921, have G2192 not G3756 we G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to forbear G3361 working G2038 (PresMidPasDepInf)?
009:007 Who G5101 goeth a warfare G4754 (PresMidInd) any time at G4218 his own G2398 charges G3800? who G5101 planteth G5452 (PresActInd) a vineyard G0290, and G2532 eateth G2068 (PresActInd) not G3756 of G1537 the fruit G2590 thereof G0846? or G2228 who G5101 feedeth G4165 (PresActInd) a flock G4167, and G2532 eateth G2068 (PresActInd) not G3756 of G1537 the milk G1051 of the flock G4167?
009:008 Say I G2980 (PresActInd) these things G5023 as G3361 G2596 a man G0444? or G2228 saith G3004 (PresActInd) not G3780 the law G3551 the same G5023 also G2532?
009:009 For G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the law G3551 of Moses G3475, Thou shalt G5392 not G3756 muzzle G5392 (FutActInd) the mouth of the ox G1016 that treadeth out the corn G0248 (PresActPtc). G3361 Doth G3199 God G2316 take care G3199 (PresActInd) for oxen G1016?
009:010 Or G2228 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) [it] altogether G3843 for G1223 our G2248 sakes G1223? For G1223 our G2248 sakes G1223, no doubt G1063, [this] is written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj): that G3754 he that ploweth G0722 (PresActPtc) should G3784 (PresActInd) plow G0722 (PresActInf) in G1909 hope G1680; and G2532 that he that thresheth G0248 (PresActPtc) in hope G1680 should be partaker G3348 (PresActInf) of G1909 his G0846 hope G1680.
009:011 If G1487 we G2249 have sown G4687 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 spiritual things G4152, [is it] a great thing G3173 if G1487 we G2249 shall reap G2325 (FutActInd) your G5216 carnal things G4559?
009:012 If G1487 others G0243 be partakers G3348 (PresActInd) of [this] power G1849 over you G5216, [are] not G3756 we G2249 rather G3123? Nevertheless G0235 we have G5530 not G3756 used G5530 (AorMidDepInd) this G5026 power G1849; but G0235 suffer G4722 (PresActInd) all things G3956, lest G3363 we should G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) G5100 hinder G1464 the gospel G2098 of Christ G5547.
009:013 Do ye G1492 not G3756 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 they which minister G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) about holy things G2413 live G2068 (PresActInd) [of the things] of G1537 the temple G2411? and they which wait G4332 (PresActPtc) at the altar G2379 are partakers G4829 (PresMidPasDepInd) with the altar G2379?
009:014 Even G2532 so G3779 hath G1299 the Lord G2962 ordained G1299 (AorActInd) that they which preach G2605 (PresActPtc) the gospel G2098 should live G2198 (PresActInf) of G1537 the gospel G2098.
009:015 But G1161 I G1473 have used G5530 (AorMidDepInd) none G3762 of these things G5130: G1161 neither G3756 have I written G1125 (AorActInd) these things G5023, that G2443 it should be G1096 so G3779 done G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) unto G1722 me G1698: for G1063 [it were] better G3123 for me G3427 to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf) G2570, than G2228 that G2443 any man G5100 should make G2758 my G3450 glorying G2745 void G2758 (AorActSubj).
009:016 For G1063 though G1437 I preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidSubj), I G3427 have G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3756 to glory of G2745: for G1063 necessity G0318 is laid upon G1945 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G3427; yea G1161, woe G3759 is G2076 (PresInd) unto me G3427, if G3362 I preach G2097 not G3362 the gospel G2097 (PresMidSubj)!
009:017 For G1063 if G1487 I do G4238 (PresActInd) this thing G5124 willingly G1635, I have G2192 (PresActInd) a reward G3408: but G1161 if G1487 against my will G0210, a dispensation G3622 [of the gospel] is committed unto me G4100 (PerfPasInd).
009:018 What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3427 reward G3408 then G3767? [Verily] that G2443, when I preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidPtc), I may make G5087 (AorActSubj) the gospel G2098 of Christ G5547 without charge G0077, that G1519 I abuse G2710 (AorMidDepInf) not G3361 my G3450 power G1849 in G1722 the gospel G2098.
009:019 For G1063 though I be G5607 (PresPtc) free G1658 from G1537 all G3956 [men], yet have I made G1402 myself G1683 servant G1402 (AorActInd) unto all G3956, that G2443 I might gain G2770 (AorActSubj) the more G4119.
009:020 And G2532 unto the Jews G2453 I became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5613 a Jew G2453, that G2443 I might gain G2770 (AorActSubj) the Jews G2453; to them that are under G5259 the law G3551, as G5613 under G5259 the law G3551, that G2443 I might gain G2770 (AorActSubj) them that are under G5259 the law G3551;
009:021 To them that are without law G0459, as G5613 without law G0459, (being G5607 (PresPtc) not G3361 without law G0459 to God G2316, but G0235 under the law G1772 to Christ G5547,) that G2443 I might gain G2770 (AorActSubj) them that are without law G0459.
009:022 To the weak G0772 became I G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5613 weak G0772, that G2443 I might gain G2770 (AorActSubj) the weak G0772: I am made G1096 (Perf2ActInd) all things G3956 to all G3956 [men], that G2443 I might G4982 by all means G3843 save G4982 (AorActSubj) some G5100.
009:023 And G1161 this G5124 I do G4160 (PresActInd) for G1223 the gospel’s G2098 sake G1223, that G2443 I might be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) partaker G4791 thereof G0846 with G4791 [you].
009:024 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 they which run G5143 (PresActPtc) in G1722 a race G4712 run G5143 (PresActInd) all G3956 G3303, but G1161 one G1520 receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) the prize G1017? So G3779 run G5143 (PresActImpr), that G2443 ye may obtain G2638 (Aor2ActSubj).
009:025 And G1161 every man G3956 that striveth for the mastery G0075 (PresMidPasDepPtc) is temperate G1467 (PresMidPasDepInd) in all things G3956. G3303 Now G3767 they G1565 [do it] to G2443 obtain G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) a corruptible G5349 crown G4735; but G1161 we G2249 an incorruptible G0862.
009:026 I G1473 therefore G5106 so G3779 run G5143 (PresActInd), not G3756 as G5613 uncertainly G0084; so G3779 fight I G4438 (PresActInd), not G3756 as G5613 one that beateth G1194 (PresActPtc) the air G0109:
009:027 But G0235 I keep under G5299 (PresActInd) my G3450 body G4983, and G2532 bring [it] into subjection G1396 (PresActInd): lest that by any means G3381 G4458, when I have preached G2784 (AorActPtc) to others G0243, I myself G0846 should be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) a castaway G0096.
010:001 ¶ Moreover G1161, brethren G0080, I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 that ye G5209 should be ignorant G0050 (PresActInf), how that G3754 all G3956 our G2257 fathers G3962 were G2258 (ImpfInd) under G5259 the cloud G3507, and G2532 all G3956 passed G1330 (Aor2ActInd) through G1223 the sea G2281;
010:002 And G2532 were G0907 all G3956 baptized G0907 (AorMidInd) unto G1519 Moses G3475 in G1722 the cloud G3507 and G2532 in G1722 the sea G2281;
010:003 And G2532 did G5315 all G3956 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) the same G0846 spiritual G4152 meat G1033;
010:004 And G2532 did G4095 all G3956 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInd) the same G0846 spiritual G4152 drink G4188: for G1063 they drank G4095 (ImpfActInd) of G1537 that spiritual G4152 Rock G4073 that followed them G0190 (PresActPtc): and G1161 that Rock G4073 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Christ G5547.
010:005 But G0235 with G1722 many G4119 of them G0846 God G2316 was G2106 not G3756 well pleased G2106 (AorActInd): for G1063 they were overthrown G2693 (AorPasInd) in G1722 the wilderness G2048.
010:006 Now G1161 these things G5023 were G1096 (AorPasDepInd) our G2257 examples G5179, to the intent G1519 we G2248 should G1511 (PresInf) not G3361 lust after evil G2556 things G1938, as G2531 they also G2548 lusted G1937 (AorActInd).
010:007 Neither G3366 be ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) idolaters G1496, as G2531 [were] some G5100 of them G0846; as G5613 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), The people G2992 sat down G2523 (AorActInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) and G2532 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 rose up G0450 (AorActInd) to play G3815 (PresActInf).
010:008 Neither G3366 let us commit fornication G4203 (PresActSubj), as G2531 some G5100 of them G0846 committed G4203 (AorActInd), and G2532 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 one G3391 day G2250 three G5140 and twenty G1501 thousand G5505.
010:009 Neither G3366 let us tempt G1598 (PresActSubj) Christ G5547, as G2531 some G5100 of them G0846 also G2532 tempted G3985 (AorActInd), and G2532 were destroyed G0622 (Aor2MidInd) of G5259 serpents G3789.
010:010 Neither G3366 murmur ye G1111 (PresActImpr), as G2531 some G5100 of them G0846 also G2532 murmured G1111 (AorActInd), and G2532 were destroyed G0622 (Aor2MidInd) of G5259 the destroyer G3644.
010:011 Now G1161 all G3956 these things G5023 happened G4819 (ImpfActInd) unto them G1565 for ensamples G5179: and G1161 they are written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj) for G4314 our G2257 admonition G3559, upon G1519 whom G3739 the ends G5056 of the world G0165 are come G2658 (AorActInd).
010:012 Wherefore G5620 let G0991 him that thinketh G1380 (PresActPtc) he standeth G2476 (PerfActInf) take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) lest G3361 he fall G4098 (Aor2ActSubj).
010:013 There hath G2983 no G3756 temptation G3986 taken G2983 (PerfActInd) you G5209 but G1508 such as is common to man G0442: but G1161 God G2316 [is] faithful G4103, who G3739 will G1439 not G3756 suffer G1439 (FutActInd) you G5209 to be tempted G3985 (AorPasInf) above G5228 that G3739 ye are able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd); but G0235 will G4160 with G4862 the temptation G3986 also G2532 make G4160 (FutActInd) a way to escape G1545, that ye G5209 may be able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInf) to bear G5297 (Aor2ActInf) [it].
010:014 Wherefore G1355, my G3450 dearly beloved G0027, flee G5343 (PresActImpr) from G0575 idolatry G1495.
010:015 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) as G5613 to wise men G5429; judge G2919 (AorActImpr) ye G5210 what G3739 I say G5346 (PresInd).
010:016 The cup G4221 of blessing G2129 which G3739 we bless G2127 (PresActInd), is it G2076 (PresInd) not G3780 the communion G2842 of the blood G0129 of Christ G5547? The bread G0740 which G3739 we break G2806 (PresActInd), is it G2076 (PresInd) not G3780 the communion G2842 of the body G4983 of Christ G5547?
010:017 For G3754 we G2070 [being] many G4183 are G2070 (PresInd) one G1520 bread G0740, [and] one G1520 body G4983: for G1063 we are G3348 all G3956 partakers G3348 (PresActInd) of G1537 that one G1520 bread G0740.
010:018 Behold G0991 (PresActImpr) Israel G2474 after G2596 the flesh G4561: are G1526 not G3780 they G1526 (PresInd) which eat G2068 (PresActPtc) of the sacrifices G2378 partakers G2844 of the altar G2379?
010:019 What G5101 say I G5346 (PresInd) then G3767? that G3754 the idol G1497 is G2076 (PresInd) any thing G5100, or G2228 that G3754 which is offered in sacrifice to idols G1494 is G2076 (PresInd) any thing G5100?
010:020 But G0235 I [say], that G3754 the things which G3739 the Gentiles G1484 sacrifice G2380 (PresActInd), they sacrifice G2380 (PresActInd) to devils G1140, and G2532 not G3756 to God G2316: and G1161 I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 that ye G5209 should have G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf) fellowship G2844 with devils G1140.
010:021 Ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) drink G4095 (PresActInf) the cup G4221 of the Lord G2962, and G2532 the cup G4221 of devils G1140: ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be partakers G3348 (PresActInf) of the Lord’s G2962 table G5132, and G2532 of the table G5132 of devils G1140.
010:022 Do we provoke G2228 G3863 the Lord G2962 to jealousy G3863 (PresActInd)? are we G2070 (PresInd) stronger than G3361 G2478 he G0846?
010:023 All things G3956 are lawful G1832 (PresInd) for me G3427, but G0235 all things G3956 are G4851 not G3756 expedient G4851 (PresActInd): all things G3956 are lawful G1832 (PresInd) for me G3427, but G0235 all things G3956 edify G3618 (PresActInd) not G3756.
010:024 Let G2212 no man G3367 seek G2212 (PresActImpr) his own G1438, but G0235 every man G1538 another’s G2087 [wealth].
010:025 Whatsoever G3956 is sold G4453 (PresPasPtc) in G1722 the shambles G3111, [that] eat G2068 (PresActImpr), asking G0350 no G3367 question G0350 (PresActPtc) for G1223 conscience G4893 sake G1223:
010:026 For G1063 the earth G1093 [is] the Lord’s G2962, and G2532 the fulness G4138 thereof G0846.
010:027  G1161 If any G1536 of them that believe not G0571 bid G2564 (PresActInd) you G5209 [to a feast], and G2532 ye be disposed G2309 (PresActInd) to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf); whatsoever G3956 is set before G3908 (PresPasPtc) you G5213, eat G2068 (PresActImpr), asking G0350 no G3367 question G0350 (PresActPtc) for G1223 conscience G4893 sake G1223.
010:028 But G1161 if G1437 any man G5100 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto you G5213, This G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) offered in sacrifice unto idols G1494, eat G2068 (PresActImpr) not G3361 for G1223 his sake G1565 that shewed it G3377 (AorActPtc), and G2532 for conscience sake G4893: for G1063 the earth G1093 [is] the Lord’s G2962, and G2532 the fulness G4138 thereof G0846:
010:029 Conscience G4893, G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd), not G3780 thine own G1438, but G0235 of the other G2087: for G1063 why G2444 is G2919 my G3450 liberty G1657 judged G2919 (PresPasInd) of G5259 another G0243 [man’s] conscience G4893?
010:030 For G1161 if G1487 I G1473 by grace G5485 be a partaker G3348 (PresActInd), why G5101 am I evil spoken of G0987 (PresPasInd) for that G5228 for which G3739 I G1473 give thanks G2168 (PresActInd)?
010:031 Whether G1535 therefore G3767 ye eat G2068 (PresActInd), or G1535 drink G4095 (PresActInd), or G1535 whatsoever G5100 ye do G4160 (PresActInd), do G4160 (PresActImpr) all G3956 to G1519 the glory G1391 of God G2316.
010:032 Give G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) none offence G0677, neither G2532 to the Jews G2453, nor G2532 to the Gentiles G1672, nor G2532 to the church G1577 of God G2316:
010:033 Even as G2531 I G2504 please G0700 (PresActInd) all G3956 [men] in all G3956 [things], not G3361 seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) mine own G1683 profit G4851 (PresActPtc), but G0235 the [profit G3588 ] of many G4183, that G2443 they may be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj).
011:001 ¶ Be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) ye followers G3402 of me G3450, even as G2531 I also G2504 [am] of Christ G5547.
011:002 Now G1161 I praise G1867 (PresActInd) you G5209, brethren G0080, that G3754 ye remember G3415 (PerfPasInd) me G3450 in all things G3956, and G2532 keep G2722 (PresActInd) the ordinances G3862, as G2531 I delivered G3860 (AorActInd) [them] to you G5213.
011:003 But G1161 I would have G2309 (PresActInd) you G5209 know G1492 (PerfActInf), that G3754 the head G2776 of every G3956 man G0435 is G2076 (PresInd) Christ G5547; and G1161 the head G2776 of the woman G1135 [is] the man G0435; and G1161 the head G2776 of Christ G5547 [is] God G2316.
011:004 Every G3956 man G0435 praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) or G2228 prophesying G4395 (PresActPtc), having G2192 (PresActPtc) [his] head G2776 covered G2596, dishonoureth G2617 (PresActInd) his G0846 head G2776.
011:005 But G1161 every G3956 woman G1135 that prayeth G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) or G2228 prophesieth G4395 (PresActPtc) with [her] head G2776 uncovered G0177 dishonoureth G2617 (PresActInd) her G1438 head G2776: for G1063 that is G2076 (PresInd) even G2532 all one G1520 as if G0846 she were shaven G3587 (PerfPasPtc).
011:006 For G1063 if G1487 the woman G1135 be G2619 not G3756 covered G2619 (PresPasInd), let her G2751 also G2532 be shorn G2751 (AorMidImpr): but G1161 if G1487 it be a shame G0149 for a woman G1135 to be shorn G2751 (AorMidInf) or G2228 shaven G3587 (PresPasInf), let her be covered G2619 (PresPasImpr).
011:007 For G1063 a man G0435 indeed G3303 ought G3784 (PresActInd) not G3756 to cover G2619 (PresPasInf) [his] head G2776, forasmuch as he is G5225 (PresActPtc) the image G1504 and G2532 glory G1391 of God G2316: but G1161 the woman G1135 is G2076 (PresInd) the glory G1391 of the man G0435.
011:008 For G1063 the man G0435 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the woman G1135; but G0235 the woman G1135 of G1537 the man G0435.
011:009  G1063 G2532 Neither G3756 was G2936 the man G0435 created G2936 (AorPasInd) for G1223 the woman G1135; but G0235 the woman G1135 for G1223 the man G0435.
011:010 For this G5124 cause G1223 ought G3784 (PresActInd) the woman G1135 to have G2192 (PresActInf) power G1849 on G1909 [her] head G2776 because G1223 of the angels G0032.
011:011 Nevertheless G4133 neither G3777 is the man G0435 without G5565 the woman G1135, neither G3777 the woman G1135 without G5565 the man G0435, in G1722 the Lord G2962.
011:012 For G1063 as G5618 the woman G1135 [is] of G1537 the man G0435, even so G3779 [is] the man G0435 also G2532 by G1223 the woman G1135; but G1161 all things G3956 of G1537 God G2316.
011:013 Judge G2919 (AorActImpr) in G1722 yourselves G5213 G0846: is it G2076 (PresInd) comely G4241 (PresActPtc) that a woman G1135 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto God G2316 uncovered G0177?
011:014 Doth G2228 not even G3761 nature G5449 itself G0846 teach G1321 (PresActInd) you G5209, that G3754, if G1437 G3303 a man G0435 have long hair G2863 (PresActSubj), it is G2076 (PresInd) a shame G0819 unto him G0846?
011:015 But G1161 if G1437 a woman G1135 have long hair G2863 (PresActSubj), it is G2076 (PresInd) a glory G1391 to her G0846: for G3754 [her] hair G2864 is given G1325 (PerfPasInd) her G0846 for G0473 a covering G4018.
011:016 But G1161 if any man G1536 seem G1380 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) contentious G5380, we G2249 have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 such G5108 custom G4914, neither G3761 the churches G1577 of God G2316.
011:017 Now G1161 in this G5124 that I declare G3853 (PresActPtc) [unto you] I praise G1867 (PresActInd) [you] not G3756, that G3754 ye come together G4905 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 for G1519 the better G2909, but G0235 for G1519 the worse G2276.
011:018 For G1063 G3303 first of all G4412, when ye G5216 come together G4905 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the church G1577, I hear G0191 (PresActInd) that there be G5225 (PresActInf) divisions G4978 among G1722 you G5213; and G2532 I partly G3313 believe G4100 (PresActInd) it G5100.
011:019 For G1063 there must G1163 (PresInd) be G1511 (PresInf) also G2532 heresies G0139 among G1722 you G5213, that G2443 they which are approved G1384 may be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) manifest G5318 among G1722 you G5213.
011:020 When ye G5216 come together G4905 (PresMidPasDepPtc) therefore G3767 into G1909 one place G0846, [this] is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) the Lord’s G2960 supper G1173.
011:021 For G1063 in G1722 eating G5315 (Aor2ActInf) every one G1538 taketh before G4301 (PresActInd) [other] his own G2398 supper G1173: and G2532 one G3739 G3303 is hungry G3983 (PresActInd), and G1161 another G3739 is drunken G3184 (PresActInd).
011:022 What G1063? have ye G2192 (PresActInd) not G3378 houses G3614 to eat G2068 (PresActInf) and G2532 to drink G4095 (PresActInf) in G1519? or G2228 despise ye G2706 (PresActInd) the church G1577 of God G2316, and G2532 shame G2617 (PresActInd) them that have G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361? What G5101 shall I say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) to you G5213? shall I praise G1867 (AorActSubj) you G5209 in G1722 this G5129? I praise G1867 (PresActInd) [you] not G3756.
011:023 For G1063 I G1473 have received G3880 (Aor2ActInd) of G0575 the Lord G2962 that which G3739 also G2532 I delivered G3860 (AorActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 the [same] night G3571 in G1722 which G3739 he was betrayed G3860 (ImpfPasInd) took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) bread G0740:
011:024 And G2532 when he had given thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), he brake G2806 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr), eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr): this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 body G4983, which G3588 is broken G2806 (PresPasPtc) for G5228 you G5216: this G5124 do G4160 (PresActImpr) in G1519 remembrance G0364 of me G1699.
011:025 After the same manner G5615 also G2532 [he took] the cup G4221, when G3326 he had supped G1172 (AorActInf), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G5124 cup G4221 is G2076 (PresInd) the new G2537 testament G1242 in G1722 my G1699 blood G0129: this G5124 do ye G4160 (PresActImpr), as oft as G3740 G0302 ye drink G4095 (PresActSubj) [it], in G1519 remembrance G0364 of me G1699.
011:026 For G1063 as often as G0302 G3740 ye eat G2068 (PresActSubj) this G5126 bread G0740, and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActSubj) this G5124 cup G4221, ye do shew G2605 (PresActInd) the Lord’s G2962 death G2288 till G0891 G0302 he G3739 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj).
011:027 Wherefore G5620 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall eat G2068 (PresActSubj) this G5126 bread G0740, and G2228 drink G4095 (PresActSubj) [this] cup G4221 of the Lord G2962, unworthily G0371, shall be G2071 (FutInd) guilty G1777 of the body G4983 and G2532 blood G0129 of the Lord G2962.
011:028 But G1161 let G1381 a man G0444 examine G1381 (PresActImpr) himself G1438, and G2532 so G3779 let him eat G2068 (PresActImpr) of G1537 [that] bread G0740, and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActImpr) of G1537 [that] cup G4221.
011:029 For G1063 he that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) and G2532 drinketh G4095 (PresActPtc) unworthily G0371, eateth G2068 (PresActInd) and G2532 drinketh G4095 (PresActInd) damnation G2917 to himself G1438, not G3361 discerning G1252 (PresActPtc) the Lord’s G2962 body G4983.
011:030 For G1223 this G5124 cause G1223 many G4183 [are] weak G0772 and G2532 sickly G0732 among G1722 you G5213, and G2532 many G2425 sleep G2837 (PresPasInd).
011:031 For G1063 if G1487 we would judge G1252 (ImpfActInd) ourselves G1438, we should G0302 not G3756 be judged G2919 (ImpfPasInd).
011:032 But G1161 when we are judged G2919 (PresPasPtc), we are chastened G3811 (PresPasInd) of G5259 the Lord G2962, that G3363 we should G2632 not G3363 be condemned G2632 (AorPasSubj) with G4862 the world G2889.
011:033 Wherefore G5620, my G3450 brethren G0080, when ye come together G4905 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1519 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf), tarry G1551 (PresMidPasDepImpr) one for another G0240.
011:034 And G1161 if any man G1536 hunger G3983 (PresActInd), let him eat G2068 (PresActImpr) at G1722 home G3624; that G3363 ye come G4905 not G3363 together G4905 (PresMidPasDepSubj) unto G1519 condemnation G2917. And G1161 the rest G3062 will I set in order G1299 (FutMidDepInd) when G5613 G0302 I come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj).
012:001 ¶ Now G1161 concerning G4012 spiritual G4152 [gifts], brethren G0080, I would G2309 not G3756 have G2309 (PresActInd) you G5209 ignorant G0050 (PresActInf).
012:002 Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) Gentiles G1484, carried away G0520 (PresPasPtc) unto G4314 these dumb G0880 idols G1497, even as G5613 G0302 ye were led G0071 (ImpfPasInd).
012:003 Wherefore G1352 I give G1107 you G5213 to understand G1107 (PresActInd), that G3754 no man G3762 speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) by G1722 the Spirit G4151 of God G2316 calleth G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 accursed G0331: and G2532 [that] no man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) say G2036 (Aor2ActInf) that Jesus G2424 is the Lord G2962, but G1508 by G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
012:004 Now G1161 there are G1526 (PresInd) diversities G1243 of gifts G5486, but G1161 the same G0846 Spirit G4151.
012:005 And G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) differences G1243 of administrations G1248, but G2532 the same G0846 Lord G2962.
012:006 And G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) diversities G1243 of operations G1755, but G1161 it is G2076 (PresInd) the same G0846 God G2316 which G3588 worketh G1754 (PresActPtc) all G3956 in G1722 all G3956.
012:007 But G1161 the manifestation G5321 of the Spirit G4151 is given G1325 (PresPasInd) to every man G1538 to G4314 profit withal G4851 (PresActPtc).
012:008 For G1063 to one G3739 G3303 is given G1325 (PresPasInd) by G1223 the Spirit G4151 the word G3056 of wisdom G4678; G1161 to another G0243 the word G3056 of knowledge G1108 by G2596 the same G0846 Spirit G4151;
012:009  G1161 To another G2087 faith G4102 by G1722 the same G0846 Spirit G4151; G1161 to another G0243 the gifts G5486 of healing G2386 by G1722 the same G0846 Spirit G4151;
012:010  G1161 To another G0243 the working G1755 of miracles G1411; G1161 to another G0243 prophecy G4394; G1161 to another G0243 discerning G1253 of spirits G4151; G1161 to another G2087 [divers] kinds G1085 of tongues G1100; G1161 to another G0243 the interpretation G2058 of tongues G1100:
012:011 But G1161 all G3956 these G5023 worketh G1754 (PresActInd) that one G1520 and G2532 the selfsame G0846 Spirit G4151, dividing G1244 (PresActPtc) to every man G1538 severally G2398 as G2531 he will G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd).
012:012 For G1063 as G2509 the body G4983 is G2076 (PresInd) one G1520, and G2532 hath G2192 (PresActInd) many G4183 members G3196, and G1161 all G3956 the members G3196 of that one G1520 body G4983, being G5607 (PresPtc) many G4183, are G2076 (PresInd) one G1520 body G4983: so G3779 also G2532 [is] Christ G5547.
012:013 For G1063 G2532 by G1722 one G1520 Spirit G4151 are G0907 we G2249 all G3956 baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) into G1519 one G1520 body G4983, whether G1535 [we be] Jews G2453 or G1535 Gentiles G1672, whether G1535 [we be] bond G1401 or G1535 free G1658; and G2532 have been G4222 all G3956 made to drink G4222 (AorPasInd) into G1519 one G1520 Spirit G4151.
012:014  G2532 For G1063 the body G4983 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 one G1520 member G3196, but G0235 many G4183.
012:015 If G1437 the foot G4228 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Because G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 the hand G5495, I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the body G4983; is G2076 (PresInd) it therefore G3756 G3844 G5124 not G3756 of G1537 the body G4983?
012:016 And G2532 if G1437 the ear G3775 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Because G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 the eye G3788, I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the body G4983; is G2076 (PresInd) it therefore G3756 G3844 G5124 not G3756 of G1537 the body G4983?
012:017 If G1487 the whole G3650 body G4983 [were] an eye G3788, where G4226 [were] the hearing G0189? If G1487 the whole G3650 [were] hearing G0189, where G4226 [were] the smelling G3750?
012:018 But G1161 now G3570 hath G5087 God G2316 set G5087 (Aor2MidInd) the members G3196 every G1538 one G1520 of them G0846 in G1722 the body G4983, as G2531 it hath pleased him G2309 (AorActInd).
012:019 And G1161 if G1487 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) all G3956 one G1520 member G3196, where G4226 [were] the body G4983?
012:020 But G1161 now G3568 G3303 [are they] many G4183 members G3196, yet but G1161 one G1520 body G4983.
012:021 And G1161 the eye G3788 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) say G2036 (Aor2ActInf) unto the hand G5495, I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 need G5532 of thee G4675: nor G2228 again G3825 the head G2776 to the feet G4228, I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 need G5532 of you G5216.
012:022 Nay G0235, much G4183 more G3123 those members G3196 of the body G4983, which seem G1380 (PresActPtc) to be G5225 (PresActInf) more feeble G0772, are G2076 (PresInd) necessary G0316:
012:023 And G2532 those G3739 [members] of the body G4983, which we think G1380 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) less honourable G0820, upon these G5125 we bestow G4060 (PresActInd) more abundant G4055 honour G5092; and G2532 our G2257 uncomely G0809 [parts] have G2192 (PresActInd) more abundant G4055 comeliness G2157.
012:024 For G1161 our G2257 comely G2158 [parts] have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 need G5532: but G0235 God G2316 hath tempered G4786 the body G4983 together G4786 (AorActInd), having given G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) more abundant G4055 honour G5092 to that [part] which lacked G5302 (PresPasPtc):
012:025 That G3363 there should be G5600 (PresSubj) no G3363 schism G4978 in G1722 the body G4983; but G0235 [that] the members G3196 should have G3309 the same G0846 care G3309 (PresActSubj) one for G5228 another G0240.
012:026 And G2532 whether G1535 one G1520 member G3196 suffer G3958 (PresActInd), all G3956 the members G3196 suffer with it G4841 (PresActInd); or G1535 one G1520 member G3196 be honoured G1392 (PresPasInd), all G3956 the members G3196 rejoice with it G4796 (PresActInd).
012:027 Now G1161 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) the body G4983 of Christ G5547, and G2532 members G3196 in G1537 particular G3313.
012:028 And G2532 G3739 God G2316 hath set G5087 (Aor2MidInd) some G3303 in G1722 the church G1577, first G4412 apostles G0652, secondarily G1208 prophets G4396, thirdly G5154 teachers G1320, after that G1899 miracles G1411, then G1534 gifts G5486 of healings G2386, helps G0484, governments G2941, diversities G1085 of tongues G1100.
012:029 [Are] all G3361 G3956 apostles G0652? [are] all G3361 G3956 prophets G4396? [are] all G3361 G3956 teachers G1320? [are] all G3361 G3956 workers of miracles G1411?
012:030 Have G3361 G2192 (PresActInd) all G3956 the gifts G5486 of healing G2386? do all G3956 speak G3361 G2980 (PresActInd) with tongues G1100? do G3361 all G3956 interpret G1329 (PresActInd)?
012:031 But G1161 covet earnestly G2206 (PresActImpr) the best G2909 gifts G5486: and G2532 yet G2089 shew I G1166 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 a more G2596 excellent G5236 way G3598.
013:001 ¶ Though G1437 I speak G2980 (PresActSubj) with the tongues G1100 of men G0444 and G2532 of angels G0032, and G1161 have G2192 (PresActSubj) not G3361 charity G0026, I am become G1096 (Perf2ActInd) [as] sounding G2278 (PresActPtc) brass G5475, or G2228 a tinkling G0214 (PresActPtc) cymbal G2950.
013:002 And G2532 though G1437 I have G2192 (PresActSubj) [the gift of] prophecy G4394, and G2532 understand G1492 (PerfActSubj) all G3956 mysteries G3466, and G2532 all G3956 knowledge G1108; and G2532 though G1437 I have G2192 (PresActSubj) all G3956 faith G4102, so G5620 that I could remove G3179 (PresActInf) mountains G3735, and G1161 have G2192 (PresActSubj) not G3361 charity G0026, I am G1510 (PresInd) nothing G3762.
013:003 And G2532 though G1437 I bestow G5595 all G3956 my G3450 goods G5224 (PresActPtc) to feed G5595 (AorActSubj) [the poor], and G2532 though G1437 I give G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) my G3450 body G4983 to G2443 be burned G2545 (FutPasSubj), and G1161 have G2192 (PresActSubj) not G3361 charity G0026, it profiteth me G5623 (PresPasInd) nothing G3762.
013:004 Charity G0026 suffereth long G3114 (PresActInd), [and] is kind G5541 (PresMidPasDepInd); charity G0026 envieth G2206 (PresActInd) not G3756; charity G0026 vaunteth G4068 not G3756 itself G4068 (PresMidPasDepInd), is G5448 not G3756 puffed up G5448 (PresPasInd),
013:005 Doth G0807 not G3756 behave itself unseemly G0807 (PresActInd), seeketh G2212 (PresActInd) not G3756 her own G1438, is G3947 not G3756 easily provoked G3947 (PresPasInd), thinketh G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) no G3756 evil G2556;
013:006 Rejoiceth G5463 (PresActInd) not G3756 in G1909 iniquity G0093, but G1161 rejoiceth G4796 (PresActInd) in the truth G0225;
013:007 Beareth G4722 (PresActInd) all things G3956, believeth G4100 (PresActInd) all things G3956, hopeth G1679 (PresActInd) all things G3956, endureth G5278 (PresActInd) all things G3956.
013:008 Charity G0026 never G3763 faileth G1601 (PresActInd): but G1161 whether G1535 [there be] prophecies G4394, they shall fail G2673 (FutPasInd); whether G1535 [there be] tongues G1100, they shall cease G3973 (FutMidDepInd); whether G1535 [there be] knowledge G1108, it shall vanish away G2673 (FutPasInd).
013:009 For G1063 we know G1097 (PresActInd) in G1537 part G3313, and G2532 we prophesy G4395 (PresActInd) in G1537 part G3313.
013:010 But G1161 when G3752 that which is perfect G5046 is come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), then G5119 that which is in G1537 part G3313 shall be done away G2673 (FutPasInd).
013:011 When G3753 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) a child G3516, I spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) as G5613 a child G3516, I understood G5426 (ImpfActInd) as G5613 a child G3516, I thought G3049 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) as G5613 a child G3516: but G1161 when G3753 I became G1096 (Perf2ActInd) a man G0435, I put away G2673 (PerfActInd) childish things G3516.
013:012 For G1063 now G0737 we see G0991 (PresActInd) through G1223 a glass G2072, darkly G1722 G0135; but G1161 then G5119 face G4383 to G4314 face G4383: now G0737 I know G1097 (PresActInd) in G1537 part G3313; but G1161 then G5119 shall I know G1921 (FutMidDepInd) even as G2531 also G2532 I am known G1921 (AorPasInd).
013:013 And G1161 now G3570 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) faith G4102, hope G1680, charity G0026, these G5023 three G5140; but G1161 the greatest G3187 of these G5130 [is] charity G0026.
014:001 ¶ Follow G1377 (PresActImpr) after charity G0026, and G1161 desire G2206 (PresActImpr) spiritual G4152 [gifts], but G1161 rather G3123 that G2443 ye may prophesy G4395 (PresActSubj).
014:002 For G1063 he that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) in an [unknown] tongue G1100 speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) not G3756 unto men G0444, but G0235 unto God G2316: for G1063 no man G3762 understandeth G0191 (PresActInd) [him]; howbeit G1161 in the spirit G4151 he speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) mysteries G3466.
014:003 But G1161 he that prophesieth G4395 (PresActPtc) speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) unto men G0444 [to] edification G3619, and G2532 exhortation G3874, and G2532 comfort G3889.
014:004 He that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) in an [unknown] tongue G1100 edifieth G3618 (PresActInd) himself G1438; but G1161 he that prophesieth G4395 (PresActPtc) edifieth G3618 (PresActInd) the church G1577.
014:005  G1161 I would G2309 (PresActInd) that ye G5209 all G3956 spake G2980 (PresActInf) with tongues G1100, but G1161 rather G3123 that G2443 ye prophesied G4395 (PresActSubj): for G1063 greater G3187 [is] he that prophesieth G4395 (PresActPtc) than G2228 he that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) with tongues G1100, except G1622 G1508 he interpret G1329 (PresActSubj), that G2443 the church G1577 may receive G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) edifying G3619.
014:006  G1161 Now G3570, brethren G0080, if G1437 I come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209 speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) with tongues G1100, what G5101 shall I profit G5623 (FutActInd) you G5209, except G3362 I shall speak G2980 (AorActSubj) to you G5213 either G2228 by G1722 revelation G0602, or G2228 by G1722 knowledge G1108, or G2228 by G1722 prophesying G4394, or G2228 by G1722 doctrine G1322?
014:007 And even G3676 things without life G0895 giving G1325 (PresActPtc) sound G5456, whether G1535 pipe G0836 or G1535 harp G2788, except G3362 they give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) a distinction G1293 in the sounds G5353, how G4459 shall it be known G1097 (FutPasInd) what is piped G0832 (PresPasPtc) or G2228 harped G2789 (PresPasPtc)?
014:008 For G1063 G2532 if G1437 the trumpet G4536 give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) an uncertain G0082 sound G5456, who G5101 shall prepare himself G3903 (FutMidDepInd) to G1519 the battle G4171?
014:009 So G3779 likewise G2532 ye G5210, except G3362 ye utter G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) by G1223 the tongue G1100 words G3056 easy to be understood G2154, how G4459 shall it be known G1097 (FutPasInd) what is spoken G2980 (PresPasPtc)? for G1063 ye shall G2071 (FutInd) speak G2980 (PresActPtc) into G1519 the air G0109.
014:010  G1487 There are G2076 (PresInd), it may be G5177 (Aor2ActOpt), so many G5118 kinds G1085 of voices G5456 in G1722 the world G2889, and G2532 none of them G3762 [is] without signification G0880 G0846.
014:011 Therefore G3767 if G3362 I know G1492 (PerfActSubj) not G3362 the meaning G1411 of the voice G5456, I shall be G2071 (FutInd) unto him that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) a barbarian G0915, and G2532 he that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) [shall be] a barbarian G0915 unto G1722 me G1698.
014:012 Even G2532 so G3779 ye G5210, forasmuch as G1893 ye are G2075 (PresInd) zealous G2207 of spiritual G4151 [gifts], seek G2212 (PresActImpr) that G2443 ye may excel G4052 (PresActSubj) to G4314 the edifying G3619 of the church G1577.
014:013 Wherefore G1355 let him that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) in an [unknown] tongue G1100 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) that G2443 he may interpret G1329 (PresActSubj).
014:014 For G1063 if G1437 I pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepSubj) in an [unknown] tongue G1100, my G3450 spirit G4151 prayeth G4336 (PresMidPasDepInd), but G1161 my G3450 understanding G3563 is G2076 (PresInd) unfruitful G0175.
014:015 What G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd) then G3767? I will pray G4336 (FutMidDepInd) with the spirit G4151, and G1161 I will pray G4336 (FutMidDepInd) with the understanding G3563 also G2532: I will sing G5567 (FutActInd) with the spirit G4151, and G1161 I will sing G5567 (FutActInd) with the understanding G3563 also G2532.
014:016 Else G1893 when G1437 thou shalt bless G2127 (AorActSubj) with the spirit G4151, how G4459 shall he that occupieth G0378 (PresActPtc) the room G5117 of the unlearned G2399 say G2046 (FutActInd) Amen G0281 at G1909 thy G4674 giving of thanks G2169, seeing G1894 he understandeth G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 thou sayest G3004 (PresActInd)?
014:017 For G1063 thou G4771 verily G3303 givest thanks G2168 (PresActInd) well G2573, but G0235 the other G2087 is G3618 not G3756 edified G3618 (PresPasInd).
014:018 I thank G2168 (PresActInd) my G3450 God G2316, I speak G2980 (PresActPtc) with tongues G1100 more than G3123 ye G5216 all G3956:
014:019 Yet G0235 in G1722 the church G1577 I had rather G2309 (PresActInd) speak G2980 (AorActInf) five G4002 words G3056 with G1223 my G3450 understanding G3563, that G2443 [by my voice] I might teach G2727 (AorActSubj) others G0243 also G2532, than G2228 ten thousand G3463 words G3056 in G1722 an [unknown] tongue G1100.
014:020 Brethren G0080, be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 children G3813 in understanding G5424: howbeit G0235 in malice G2549 be ye children G3515 (PresActImpr), but G1161 in understanding G5424 be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) men G5046.
014:021 In G1722 the law G3551 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 With G1722 [men of] other tongues G2084 and G2532 other G1722 G2087 lips G5491 will I speak G2980 (FutActInd) unto this G5129 people G2992; and G2532 yet for all G3779 that will they G1522 not G3761 hear G1522 (FutMidDepInd) me G3450, saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962.
014:022 Wherefore G5620 tongues G1100 are G1526 (PresInd) for G1519 a sign G4592, not G3756 to them that believe G4100 (PresActPtc), but G0235 to them that believe not G0571: but G1161 prophesying G4394 [serveth] not G3756 for them that believe not G0571, but G0235 for them which believe G4100 (PresActPtc).
014:023 If G1437 therefore G3767 the whole G3650 church G1577 be come together G4905 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1909 one place G0846, and G2532 all G3956 speak G2980 (PresActSubj) with tongues G1100, and G1161 there come in G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) [those that are] unlearned G2399, or G2228 unbelievers G0571, will they G2046 not G3756 say G2046 (FutActInd) that G3754 ye are mad G3105 (PresMidPasDepInd)?
014:024 But G1161 if G1437 all G3956 prophesy G4395 (PresActSubj), and G1161 there come in G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) one G5100 that believeth not G0571, or G2228 [one] unlearned G2399, he is convinced G1651 (PresPasInd) of G5259 all G3956, he is judged G0350 (PresPasInd) of G5259 all G3956:
014:025 And G2532 thus G3779 are G1096 the secrets G2927 of his G0846 heart G2588 made G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) manifest G5318; and G2532 so G3779 falling down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) on G1909 [his] face G4383 he will worship G4352 (FutActInd) God G2316, and report G0518 (PresActPtc) that G3754 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 you G5213 of a truth G3689.
014:026 How G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd) then G3767, brethren G0080? when G3752 ye come together G4905 (PresMidPasDepSubj), every one G1538 of you G5216 hath G2192 (PresActInd) a psalm G5568, hath G2192 (PresActInd) a doctrine G1322, hath G2192 (PresActInd) a tongue G1100, hath G2192 (PresActInd) a revelation G0602, hath G2192 (PresActInd) an interpretation G2058. Let G1096 all things G3956 be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepImpr) unto G4314 edifying G3619.
014:027 If G1535 any man G5100 speak G2980 (PresActInd) in an [unknown] tongue G1100, [let it be] by G2596 two G1417, or G2228 at the most G4118 [by] three G5140, and G2532 [that] by G0303 course G3313; and G2532 let G1329 one G1520 interpret G1329 (PresActImpr).
014:028 But G1161 if G3362 there be G5600 (PresSubj) no G3362 interpreter G1328, let him keep silence G4601 (PresActImpr) in G1722 the church G1577; and G1161 let him speak G2980 (PresActImpr) to himself G1438, and G2532 to God G2316.
014:029  G1161 Let G2980 the prophets G4396 speak G2980 (PresActImpr) two G1417 or G2228 three G5140, and G2532 let G1252 the other G0243 judge G1252 (PresActImpr).
014:030 If G1161 G1437 [any thing] be revealed G0601 (AorPasSubj) to another G0243 that sitteth by G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc), let G4601 the first G4413 hold his peace G4601 (PresActImpr).
014:031 For G1063 ye may G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) all G3956 prophesy G4395 (PresActInf) one by one G2596 G1520, that G2443 all G3956 may learn G3129 (PresActSubj), and G2532 all G3956 may be comforted G3870 (PresPasSubj).
014:032 And G2532 the spirits G4151 of the prophets G4396 are subject G5293 (PresPasInd) to the prophets G4396.
014:033 For G1063 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 [the author] of confusion G0181, but G0235 of peace G1515, as G5613 in G1722 all G3956 churches G1577 of the saints G0040.
014:034 Let G4601 your G5216 women G1135 keep silence G4601 (PresActImpr) in G1722 the churches G1577: for G1063 it is G2010 not G3756 permitted G2010 (PerfPasInd) unto them G0846 to speak G2980 (PresActInf); but G0235 [they are commanded] to be under obedience G5293 (PresMidInf), as G2531 also G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the law G3551.
014:035 And G1161 if G1487 they will G2309 (PresActInd) learn G3129 (Aor2ActInf) any thing G5100, let them ask G1905 (PresActImpr) their G2398 husbands G0435 at G1722 home G3624: for G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) a shame G0149 for women G1135 to speak G2980 (PresActInf) in G1722 the church G1577.
014:036 What G2228? came G1831 the word G3056 of God G2316 out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 you G5216? or G2228 came it G2658 (AorActInd) unto G1519 you G5209 only G3441?
014:037 If any man G1536 think himself G1380 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) a prophet G4396, or G2228 spiritual G4152, let him acknowledge G1921 (PresActImpr) that G3754 the things G3739 that I write G1125 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 are G1526 (PresInd) the commandments G1785 of the Lord G2962.
014:038 But G1161 if any man G1536 be ignorant G0050 (PresActInd), let him be ignorant G0050 (PresActImpr).
014:039 Wherefore G5620, brethren G0080, covet G2206 (PresActImpr) to prophesy G4395 (PresActInf), and G2532 forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) not G3361 to speak G2980 (PresActInf) with tongues G1100.
014:040 Let G1096 all things G3956 be done G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) decently G2156 and G2532 in G2596 order G5010.
015:001 ¶ Moreover G1161, brethren G0080, I declare G1107 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 the gospel G2098 which G3739 I preached G2097 (AorMidInd) unto you G5213, which G3739 also G2532 ye have received G3880 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 wherein G1722 G3739 ye stand G2476 (PerfActInd);
015:002 By G1223 which G3739 also G2532 ye are saved G4982 (PresPasInd), if G1487 ye keep G2722 (PresActInd) in memory what G5101 G3056 I preached G2097 (AorMidInd) unto you G5213, unless G1622 G1508 ye have believed G4100 (AorActInd) in vain G1500.
015:003 For G1063 I delivered G3860 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 first of all G1722 G4413 that which G3739 I G3880 also G2532 received G3880 (Aor2ActInd), how G3754 that Christ G5547 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) for G5228 our G2257 sins G0266 according G2596 to the scriptures G1124;
015:004 And G2532 that G3754 he was buried G2290 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 that G3754 he rose again G1453 (PerfPasInd) the third G5154 day G2250 according G2596 to the scriptures G1124:
015:005 And G2532 that G3754 he was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) of Cephas G2786, then G1534 of the twelve G1427:
015:006 After that G1899, he was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) of above G1883 five hundred G4001 brethren G0080 at once G2178; of G1537 whom G3739 the greater part G4119 remain G3306 (PresActInd) unto G2193 this present G0737, but G1161 some G5100 G2532 are fallen asleep G2837 (AorPasInd).
015:007 After that G1899, he was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) of James G2385; then G1534 of all G3956 the apostles G0652.
015:008 And G1161 last G2078 of all G3956 he was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) of me also G2504, as G5619 of one born out of due time G1626.
015:009 For G1063 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the least G1646 of the apostles G0652, that G3739 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 meet G2425 to be called G2564 (PresPasInf) an apostle G0652, because G1360 I persecuted G1377 (AorActInd) the church G1577 of God G2316.
015:010 But G1161 by the grace G5485 of God G2316 I am G1510 (PresInd) what G3739 I am G1510 (PresInd): and G2532 his G0846 grace G5485 which [was bestowed] upon G1519 me G1691 was G1096 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 in vain G2756; but G0235 I laboured G2872 (AorActInd) more abundantly G4054 than they G0846 all G3956: yet G1161 not G3756 I G1473, but G0235 the grace G5485 of God G2316 which G3588 was with G4862 me G1698.
015:011 Therefore G3767 whether G1535 [it were] I G1473 or G1535 they G1565, so G3779 we preach G2784 (PresActInd), and G2532 so G3779 ye believed G4100 (AorActInd).
015:012 Now G1161 if G1487 Christ G5547 be preached G2784 (PresPasInd) that G3754 he rose G1453 (PerfPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, how G4459 say G3004 (PresActInd) some G5100 among G1722 you G5213 that G3754 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498?
015:013 But G1161 if G1487 there be G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498, then G3761 is G1453 Christ G5547 not G3761 risen G1453 (PerfPasInd):
015:014 And G1161 if G1487 Christ G5547 be G1453 not G3756 risen G1453 (PerfPasInd), then G0686 [is] our G2257 preaching G2782 vain G2756, and G2532 your G5216 faith G4102 [is] G1161 also G2532 vain G2756.
015:015 Yea G1161, and G2532 we are found G2147 (PresPasInd) false witnesses G5575 of God G2316; because G3754 we have testified G3140 (AorActInd) of G2596 God G2316 that G3754 he raised up G1453 (AorActInd) Christ G5547: whom G3739 he raised G1453 not G3756 up G1453 (AorActInd), if G1512 so be G0686 that the dead G3498 rise G1453 (PresPasInd) not G3756.
015:016 For G1063 if G1487 the dead G3498 rise G1453 (PresPasInd) not G3756, then is G1453 not G3761 Christ G5547 raised G1453 (PerfPasInd):
015:017 And G1161 if G1487 Christ G5547 be G1453 not G3756 raised G1453 (PerfPasInd), your G5216 faith G4102 [is] vain G3152; ye are G2075 (PresInd) yet G2089 in G1722 your G5216 sins G0266.
015:018 Then G0686 they also G2532 which are fallen asleep G2837 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 Christ G5547 are perished G0622 (Aor2MidInd).
015:019 If G1487 in G1722 this G5026 life G2222 only G3440 we have hope G1679 (PerfActPtc) G2070 (PresInd) in G1722 Christ G5547, we are G2070 (PresInd) of all G3956 men G0444 most miserable G1652.
015:020 But G1161 now G3570 is G1453 Christ G5547 risen G1453 (PerfPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, [and] become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) the firstfruits G0536 of them that slept G2837 (PerfPasPtc).
015:021 For G1063 since G1894 by G1223 man G0444 [came] death G2288, by G1223 man G0444 [came] also G2532 the resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498.
015:022 For G1063 as G5618 in G1722 Adam G0076 all G3956 die G0599 (PresActInd), even G2532 so G3779 in G1722 Christ G5547 shall G2227 all G3956 be made alive G2227 (FutPasInd).
015:023 But G1161 every man G1538 in G1722 his own G2398 order G5001: Christ G5547 the firstfruits G0536; afterward G1899 they that are G3588 Christ’s G5547 at G1722 his G0846 coming G3952.
015:024 Then G1534 [cometh] the end G5056, when G3752 he shall have delivered up G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) the kingdom G0932 to God G2316, even G2532 the Father G3962; when G3752 he shall have put down G2673 (AorActSubj) all G3956 rule G0746 and G2532 all G3956 authority G1849 and G2532 power G1411.
015:025 For G1063 he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) reign G0936 (PresActInf), till G0891 G3739 he hath put G0302 G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) all G3956 enemies G2190 under G5259 his G0846 feet G4228.
015:026 The last G2078 enemy G2190 [that] shall be destroyed G2673 (PresPasInd) [is] death G2288.
015:027 For G1063 he hath put G5293 (AorActInd) all things G3956 under G5259 his G0846 feet G4228. But G1161 when G3752 he saith G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) G3754 all things G3956 are put under G5293 (PerfPasInd) [him, it is] manifest G1212 that G3754 he is excepted G1622, which did put G5293 all things G3956 under G5293 (AorActPtc) him G0846.
015:028 And G1161 when G3752 all things G3956 shall be subdued G5293 (Aor2PasSubj) unto him G0846, then G5119 shall G5293 the Son G5207 also G2532 himself G0846 be subject G5293 (Fut2PasInd) unto him that put G5293 all things G3956 under G5293 (AorActPtc) him G0846, that G2443 God G2316 may be G5600 (PresSubj) all G3956 in G1722 all G3956.
015:029 Else G1893 what G5101 shall they do G4160 (FutActInd) which are baptized G0907 (PresPasPtc) for G5228 the dead G3498, if G1487 the dead G3498 rise G1453 (PresPasInd) not G3756 at all G3654? why G5101 G2532 are they then baptized G0907 (PresPasInd) for G5228 the dead G3498?
015:030 And G2532 why G5101 stand G2793 we G2249 in jeopardy G2793 (PresActInd) every G3956 hour G5610?
015:031 I protest by G3513 your G5212 rejoicing G2251 G2746 which G3739 I have G2192 (PresActInd) in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424 our G2257 Lord G2962, I die G0599 (PresActInd) daily G2596 G2250.
015:032 If G1487 after the manner G2596 of men G0444 I have fought with beasts G2341 (AorActInd) at G1722 Ephesus G2181, what G5101 advantageth it G3786 me G3427, if G1487 the dead G3498 rise G1453 (PresPasInd) not G3756? let us eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) and G2532 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj); for G1063 to morrow G0839 we die G0599 (PresActInd).
015:033 Be G4105 not G3361 deceived G4105 (PresPasImpr): evil G2556 communications G3657 corrupt G5351 (PresActInd) good G5543 manners G2239.
015:034 Awake G1594 (AorActImpr) to righteousness G1346, and G2532 sin G0264 (PresActImpr) not G3361; for G1063 some G5100 have G2192 (PresActInd) not the knowledge G0056 of God G2316: I speak G3004 (PresActInd) [this] to G4314 your G5213 shame G1791.
015:035 But G0235 some G5100 [man] will say G2046 (FutActInd), How G4459 are G1453 the dead G3498 raised up G1453 (PresPasInd)? and G1161 with what G4169 body G4983 do they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd)?
015:036 [Thou] fool G0878, that which G3739 thou G4771 sowest G4687 (PresActInd) is G2227 not G3756 quickened G2227 (PresPasInd), except G3362 it die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj):
015:037 And G2532 that which G3739 thou sowest G4687 (PresActInd), thou sowest G4687 (PresActInd) not G3756 that body G4983 that shall be G1096 (FutMidDepPtc), but G0235 bare G1131 grain G2848, it may chance G1487 G5177 (Aor2ActOpt) of wheat G4621, or G2228 of some G5100 other G3062 [grain]:
015:038 But G1161 God G2316 giveth G1325 (PresActInd) it G0846 a body G4983 as G2531 it hath pleased him G2309 (AorActInd), and G2532 to every G1538 seed G4690 his own G2398 body G4983.
015:039 All G3956 flesh G4561 [is] not G3756 the same G0846 flesh G4561: but G0235 G3303 [there is] one G0243 [kind of] flesh G4561 of men G0444, G1161 another G0243 flesh G4561 of beasts G2934, G1161 another G0243 of fishes G2486, [and] G1161 another G0243 of birds G4421.
015:040 [There are] also G2532 celestial G2032 bodies G4983, and G2532 bodies G4983 terrestrial G1919: but G0235 G3303 the glory G1391 of the celestial G2032 [is] one G2087, and G1161 the [glory] of the terrestrial G1919 [is] another G2087.
015:041 [There is] one G0243 glory G1391 of the sun G2246, and G2532 another G0243 glory G1391 of the moon G4582, and G2532 another G0243 glory G1391 of the stars G0792: for G1063 [one] star G0792 differeth from G1308 (PresActInd) [another] star G0792 in G1722 glory G1391.
015:042 So G3779 also G2532 [is] the resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498. It is sown G4687 (PresPasInd) in G1722 corruption G5356; it is raised G1453 (PresPasInd) in G1722 incorruption G0861:
015:043 It is sown G4687 (PresPasInd) in G1722 dishonour G0819; it is raised G1453 (PresPasInd) in G1722 glory G1391: it is sown G4687 (PresPasInd) in G1722 weakness G0769; it is raised G1453 (PresPasInd) in G1722 power G1411:
015:044 It is sown G4687 (PresPasInd) a natural G5591 body G4983; it is raised G1453 (PresPasInd) a spiritual G4152 body G4983. There is G2076 (PresInd) a natural G5591 body G4983, and G2532 there is G2076 (PresInd) a spiritual G4152 body G4983.
015:045 And G2532 so G3779 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), The first G4413 man G0444 Adam G0076 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1519 a living G2198 (PresActPtc) soul G5590; the last G2078 Adam G0076 [was made] G1519 a quickening G2227 (PresActPtc) spirit G4151.
015:046 Howbeit G0235 that [was] not G3756 first G4412 which is spiritual G4152, but G0235 that which is natural G5591; and afterward G1899 that which is spiritual G4152.
015:047 The first G4413 man G0444 [is] of G1537 the earth G1093, earthy G5517: the second G1208 man G0444 [is] the Lord G2962 from G1537 heaven G3772.
015:048 As G3634 [is] the earthy G5517, such G5108 [are] they also G2532 that are earthy G5517: and G2532 as [is] G3634 the heavenly G2032, such G5108 [are] they G2032 also G2532 that are heavenly G2032.
015:049 And G2532 as G2531 we have borne G5409 (AorActInd) the image G1504 of the earthy G5517, we shall G5409 also G2532 bear G5409 (FutActInd) the image G1504 of the heavenly G2032.
015:050 Now G1161 this G5124 I say G5346 (PresInd), brethren G0080, that G3754 flesh G4561 and G2532 blood G0129 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) inherit G2816 (AorActInf) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316; neither G3761 doth G2816 corruption G5356 inherit G2816 (PresActInd) incorruption G0861.
015:051 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I shew G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 a mystery G3466; We shall G2837 not G3756 all G3956 G3303 sleep G2837 (FutPasInd), but G1161 we shall G0236 all G3956 be changed G0236 (Fut2PasInd),
015:052 In G1722 a moment G0823, in G1722 the twinkling G4493 of an eye G3788, at G1722 the last G2078 trump G4536: for G1063 the trumpet shall sound G4537 (FutActInd), and G2532 the dead G3498 shall be raised G1453 (FutPasInd) incorruptible G0862, and G2532 we G2249 shall be changed G0236 (Fut2PasInd).
015:053 For G1063 this G5124 corruptible G5349 must G1163 (PresInd) put on G1746 (AorMidInf) incorruption G0861, and G2532 this G5124 mortal G2349 [must] put on G1746 (AorMidInf) immortality G0110.
015:054 So G1161 when G3752 this G5124 corruptible G5349 shall have put on G1746 (AorMidSubj) incorruption G0861, and G2532 this G5124 mortal G2349 shall have put on G1746 (AorMidSubj) immortality G0110, then G5119 shall be brought to pass G1096 (FutMidDepInd) the saying G3056 that is written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), Death G2288 is swallowed up G2666 (AorPasInd) in G1519 victory G3534.
015:055 O death G2288, where G4226 [is] thy G4675 sting G2759? O grave G0086, where G4226 [is] thy G4675 victory G3534?
015:056  G1161 The sting G2759 of death G2288 [is] sin G0266; and G1161 the strength G1411 of sin G0266 [is] the law G3551.
015:057 But G1161 thanks G5485 [be] to God G2316, which G3588 giveth G1325 (PresActPtc) us G2254 the victory G3534 through G1223 our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
015:058 Therefore G5620, my G3450 beloved G0027 brethren G0080, be ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) stedfast G1476, unmoveable G0277, always G3842 abounding G4052 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the work G2041 of the Lord G2962, forasmuch as ye know G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 your G5216 labour G2873 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 in vain G2756 in G1722 the Lord G2962.
016:001 ¶ Now G1161 concerning G4012 the collection G3048 for G1519 the saints G0040, as G5618 I have given order G1299 (AorActInd) to the churches G1577 of Galatia G1053, even G2532 so G3779 do G4160 (AorActImpr) ye G5210.
016:002 Upon G2596 the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521 let G5087 every one G1538 of you G5216 lay G5087 (PresActImpr) by G3844 him G1438 in store G2343 (PresActPtc), as G3748 G0302 [God] hath prospered him G2137 (PresPasSubj), that G3363 there be G1096 (PresMidPasDepSubj) no G3363 gatherings G3048 G5119 when G3752 I come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj).
016:003 And G1161 when G3752 I come G3854 (Aor2MidDepSubj), whomsoever G3739 G1437 ye shall approve G1381 (AorActSubj) by G1223 [your] letters G1992, them G5128 will I send G3992 (FutActInd) to bring G0667 (Aor2ActInf) your G5216 liberality G5485 unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
016:004 And G1161 if G1437 it be G5600 (PresSubj) meet G0514 that I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) also G2504, they shall go G4198 (FutMidDepInd) with G4862 me G1698.
016:005 Now G1161 I will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) unto G4314 you G5209, when G3752 I shall pass through G1330 (Aor2ActSubj) Macedonia G3109: for G1063 I do pass through G1330 (PresMidPasDepInd) Macedonia G3109.
016:006 And G1161 it may be G5177 (Aor2ActPtc) that I will abide G3887 (FutActInd), yea G2228, and G2532 winter G3914 (FutActInd) with G4314 you G5209, that G2443 ye G5210 may bring G4311 me G3165 on my journey G4311 (AorActSubj) whithersoever G3757 G1437 I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepSubj).
016:007 For G1063 I will G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) you G5209 now G0737 by G1722 the way G3938; but G1161 I trust G1679 (PresActInd) to tarry G1961 (AorActInf) a while G5100 G5550 with G4314 you G5209, if G1437 the Lord G2962 permit G2010 (PresActSubj).
016:008 But G1161 I will tarry G1961 (FutActInd) at G1722 Ephesus G2181 until G2193 Pentecost G4005.
016:009 For G1063 a great G3173 door G2374 and G2532 effectual G1756 is opened G0455 (Perf2ActInd) unto me G3427, and G2532 [there are] many G4183 adversaries G0480 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
016:010 Now G1161 if G1437 Timotheus G5095 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), see G0991 (PresActImpr) that G2443 he may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) with G4314 you G5209 without fear G0870: for G1063 he worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd) the work G2041 of the Lord G2962, as G5613 I G1473 also G2532 [do].
016:011 Let G1848 no G3361 man G5100 therefore G3767 despise G1848 (AorActSubj) him G0846: but G1161 conduct G4311 him G0846 forth G4311 (AorActImpr) in G1722 peace G1515, that G2443 he may come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 me G3165: for G1063 I look for G1551 (PresMidPasDepInd) him G0846 with G3326 the brethren G0080.
016:012 As G1161 touching G4012 [our] brother G0080 Apollos G0625, I G3870 greatly G4183 desired G3870 (AorActInd) him G0846 to G2443 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209 with G3326 the brethren G0080: but G2532 his will G2307 was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 at all G3843 to G2443 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) at this G3568 time; but G1161 he will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) when G3752 he shall have convenient time G2119 (AorActSubj).
016:013 Watch ye G1127 (PresActImpr), stand fast G4739 (PresActImpr) in G1722 the faith G4102, quit you like men G0407 (PresMidPasDepImpr), be strong G2901 (PresPasImpr).
016:014 Let G1096 all G3956 your G5216 things G3956 be done G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) with G1722 charity G0026.
016:015  G1161 I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209, brethren G0080, (ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) the house G3614 of Stephanas G4734, that G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) the firstfruits G0536 of Achaia G0882, and G2532 [that] they have addicted G5021 (AorActInd) themselves G1438 to G1519 the ministry G1248 of the saints G0040,)
016:016  G2532 That G2443 ye G5210 submit yourselves G5293 (PresPasSubj) unto such G5108, and G2532 to every one G3956 that helpeth G4903 (PresActPtc) with [us], and G2532 laboureth G2872 (PresActPtc).
016:017  G1161 I am glad G5463 (PresActInd) of G1909 the coming G3952 of Stephanas G4734 and G2532 Fortunatus G5415 and G2532 Achaicus G0883: for that G3754 which was lacking G5303 on your part G5216 they G3778 have supplied G0378 (AorActInd).
016:018 For G1063 they have refreshed G0373 (AorActInd) my G1699 spirit G4151 and G2532 yours G5216: therefore G3767 acknowledge ye G1921 (PresActImpr) them that are such G5108.
016:019 The churches G1577 of Asia G0773 salute G0782 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5209. Aquila G0207 and G2532 Priscilla G4252 salute G0782 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5209 much G4183 in G1722 the Lord G2962, with G4862 the church G1577 that is in G2596 their G0846 house G3624.
016:020 All G3956 the brethren G0080 greet G0782 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5209. Greet ye G0782 (AorMidDepImpr) one another G0240 with G1722 an holy G0040 kiss G5370.
016:021 The salutation G0783 of [me] Paul G3972 with mine own G1699 hand G5495.
016:022 If any man G1536 love G5368 (PresActInd) not G3756 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, let him be G2277 (PresImpr) Anathema G0331 Maranatha G3134.
016:023 The grace G5485 of our Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 [be] with G3326 you G5216.
016:024 My G3450 love G0026 [be] with G3326 you G5216 all G3956 in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424. Amen G0281. «[The first G4413 [epistle] to G4314 the Corinthians G2881 was written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj) from G0575 Philippi G5375 by G1223 Stephanas G4734 and G2532 Fortunatus G5415 and G2532 Achaicus G0883 and G2532 Timotheus G5095.]»
