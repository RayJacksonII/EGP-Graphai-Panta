001:001 ¶ The beginning G0746 of the gospel G2098 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of God G2316;
001:002 As G5613 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the prophets G4396, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 (PresActInd) my G3450 messenger G0032 before G4253 thy G4675 face G4383, which G3739 shall prepare G2680 (FutActInd) thy G4675 way G3598 before G1715 thee G4675.
001:003 The voice G5456 of one crying G0994 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048, Prepare ye G2090 (AorActImpr) the way G3598 of the Lord G2962, make G4160 (PresActImpr) his G0846 paths G5147 straight G2117.
001:004 John G2491 did G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) baptize G0907 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048, and G2532 preach G2784 (PresActPtc) the baptism G0908 of repentance G3341 for G1519 the remission G0859 of sins G0266.
001:005 And G2532 there went out G1607 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846 all G3956 the land G5561 of Judaea G2449, and G2532 they of Jerusalem G2415, and G2532 were G0907 all G3956 baptized G0907 (ImpfPasInd) of G5259 him G0846 in G1722 the river G4215 of Jordan G2446, confessing G1843 (PresMidPtc) their G0846 sins G0266.
001:006 And G1161 John G2491 was G2258 (ImpfInd) clothed G1746 (PerfMidPtc) with camel’s G2574 hair G2359, and G2532 with a girdle G2223 of a skin G1193 about G4012 his G0846 loins G3751; and G2532 he did eat G2068 (PresActPtc) locusts G0200 and G2532 wild G0066 honey G3192;
001:007 And G2532 preached G2784 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), There cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) one mightier than G2478 I G3450 after G3694 me G3450, the latchet G2438 of whose G3739 shoes G0846 G5266 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G2425 to stoop down G2955 (AorActPtc) and unloose G3089 (AorActInf).
001:008 I G1473 indeed G3303 have baptized G0907 (AorActInd) you G5209 with G1722 water G5204: but G1161 he G0846 shall baptize G0907 (FutActInd) you G5209 with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
001:009 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250, that Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 Nazareth G3478 of Galilee G1056, and G2532 was baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) of G5259 John G2491 in G1519 Jordan G2446.
001:010 And G2532 straightway G2112 coming up G0305 (PresActPtc) out of G0575 the water G5204, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the heavens G3772 opened G4977 (PresPasPtc), and G2532 the Spirit G4151 like G5616 a dove G4058 descending G2597 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 him G0846:
001:011 And G2532 there came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772, [saying], Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207, in G1722 whom G3739 I am well pleased G2106 (AorActInd).
001:012 And G2532 immediately G2117 the Spirit G4151 driveth G1544 (PresActInd) him G0846 into G1519 the wilderness G2048.
001:013 And G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 in G1722 the wilderness G2048 forty G5062 days G2250, tempted G3985 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 Satan G4567; and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 the wild beasts G2342; and G2532 the angels G0032 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846.
001:014 Now G1161 after G3326 that John G2491 was put in prison G3860 (AorPasInf), Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Galilee G1056, preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the gospel G2098 of the kingdom G0932 of God G2316,
001:015 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 The time G2540 is fulfilled G4137 (PerfPasInd), and G2532 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd): repent ye G3340 (PresActImpr), and G2532 believe G4100 (PresActImpr) G1722 the gospel G2098.
001:016 Now G1161 as he walked G4043 (PresActPtc) by G3844 the sea G2281 of Galilee G1056, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) Simon G4613 and G2532 Andrew G0406 his G0846 brother G0080 casting G0906 (PresActPtc) a net G0293 into G1722 the sea G2281: for G1063 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) fishers G0231.
001:017 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Come ye G1205 (Impr) after G3694 me G3450, and G2532 I will make G4160 (FutActInd) you G5209 to become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) fishers G0231 of men G0444.
001:018 And G2532 straightway G2112 they forsook G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 nets G1350, and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
001:019 And G2532 when he had gone G4260 a little G3641 further G4260 (Aor2ActPtc) thence G1564, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) James G2385 the [son] G3588 of Zebedee G2199, and G2532 John G2491 his G0846 brother G0080, who G0846 also G2532 were in G1722 the ship G4143 mending G2675 (PresActPtc) their nets G1350.
001:020 And G2532 straightway G2112 he called G2564 (AorActInd) them G0846: and G2532 they left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 father G3962 Zebedee G2199 in G1722 the ship G4143 with G3326 the hired servants G3411, and went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) after G3694 him G0846.
001:021 And G2532 they went G1531 (PresMidPasDepInd) into G1519 Capernaum G2584; and G2532 straightway G2112 on the sabbath day G4521 he entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the synagogue G4864, and taught G1321 (ImpfActInd).
001:022 And G2532 they were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 doctrine G1322: for G1063 he taught G1321 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) them G0846 as G5613 one that had G2192 (PresActPtc) authority G1849, and G2532 not G3756 as G5613 the scribes G1122.
001:023 And G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 their G0846 synagogue G4864 a man G0444 with G1722 an unclean G0169 spirit G4151; and G2532 he cried out G0349 (AorActInd),
001:024 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Let [us] alone G1436; what G5101 have we G2254 to do G2532 with thee G4671, thou Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3479? art thou come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) us G2248? I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thee G4571 who G5101 thou art G1488 (PresInd), the Holy One G0040 of God G2316.
001:025 And G2532 Jesus G2424 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hold thy peace G5392 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 come G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 him G0846.
001:026 And G2532 when the unclean G0169 spirit G4151 had torn G4682 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 cried G2896 (AorActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, he came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 him G0846.
001:027 And G2532 they were G2284 all G3956 amazed G2284 (AorPasInd), insomuch that G5620 they questioned G4802 (PresActInf) among G4314 themselves G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What thing G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778? what G5101 new G2537 doctrine G1322 [is] this G5124? for G3754 with G2596 authority G1849 commandeth G2004 (PresActInd) he even G2532 the unclean G0169 spirits G4151, and G2532 they do obey G5219 (PresActInd) him G0846.
001:028 And G1161 immediately G2117 his G0846 fame G0189 spread abroad G1831 (Aor2ActInd) throughout G1519 all G3650 the region round about G4066 Galilee G1056.
001:029 And G2532 forthwith G2112, when they were come G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the synagogue G4864, they entered G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3614 of Simon G4613 and G2532 Andrew G0406, with G3326 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491.
001:030 But G1161 Simon’s G4613 wife’s mother G3994 lay G2621 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) sick of a fever G4445 (PresActPtc), and G2532 anon G2112 they tell G3004 (PresActInd) him G0846 of G4012 her G0846.
001:031 And G2532 he came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and took G2902 (AorActPtc) her G0846 by the hand G5495, and lifted G1453 her G0846 up G1453 (AorActInd); and G2532 immediately G2112 the fever G4446 left G0863 (AorActInd) her G0846, and G2532 she ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846.
001:032 And G1161 at G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) even G3798, when G3753 the sun G2246 did set G1416 (Aor2ActInd), they brought G5342 (ImpfActInd) unto G4314 him G0846 all G3956 that were G2192 (PresActPtc) diseased G2560, and G2532 them that were possessed with devils G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
001:033 And G2532 all G3650 the city G4172 was G2258 (ImpfInd) gathered together G1996 (PerfPasPtc) at G4314 the door G2374.
001:034 And G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) many G4183 that were G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560 of divers G4164 diseases G3554, and G2532 cast out G1544 (Aor2ActInd) many G4183 devils G1140; and G2532 suffered G0863 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 the devils G1140 to speak G2980 (PresActInf), because G3754 they knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) him G0846.
001:035 And G2532 in the morning G4404, rising up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) a great while G3029 before day G1773, he went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a solitary G2048 place G5117, and there G2546 prayed G4336 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
001:036 And G2532 Simon G4613 and G2532 they that were with G3326 him G0846 followed after G2614 (AorActInd) him G0846.
001:037 And G2532 when they had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, they said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, G3754 All G3956 [men] seek G2212 (PresActInd) for thee G4571.
001:038 And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Let us go G0071 (PresActSubj) into G1519 the next G2192 (PresPasPtc) towns G2969, that G2443 I may preach G2784 (AorActSubj) there also G2546: for G1063 therefore G1519 G5124 came I forth G1831 (PerfActInd).
001:039 And G2532 he preached G2784 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 their G0846 synagogues G4864 throughout G1519 all G3650 Galilee G1056, and G2532 cast out G1544 (PresActPtc) devils G1140.
001:040 And G2532 there came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) a leper G3015 to G4314 him G0846, beseeching G3870 (PresActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 kneeling down G1120 (PresActPtc) to him G0846, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, G3754 If G1437 thou wilt G2309 (PresActSubj), thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) make G2511 me G3165 clean G2511 (AorActInf).
001:041 And G1161 Jesus G2424, moved with compassion G4697 (AorPasDepPtc), put forth G1614 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495, and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I will G2309 (PresActInd); be thou clean G2511 (AorPasImpr).
001:042 And G2532 as soon as he G0846 had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), immediately G2112 the leprosy G3014 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 him G0846, and G2532 he was cleansed G2511 (AorPasInd).
001:043 And G2532 he straitly charged G1690 (AorMidDepPtc) him G0846, and forthwith G2112 sent G1544 him G0846 away G1544 (Aor2ActInd);
001:044 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, See G3708 (PresActImpr) thou say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) nothing G3367 to any man G3367: but G0235 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr), shew G1166 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572 to the priest G2409, and G2532 offer G4374 (Aor2ActImpr) for G4012 thy G4675 cleansing G2512 those things G3739 which Moses G3475 commanded G4367 (AorActInd), for G1519 a testimony G3142 unto them G0846.
001:045 But G1161 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to publish G2784 (PresActInf) [it] much G4183, and G2532 to blaze abroad G1310 (PresActInf) the matter G3056, insomuch that G5620 Jesus G0846 could G1410 (PresMidPasDepInf) no more G3371 openly G5320 enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the city G4172, but G0235 was G2258 (ImpfInd) without G1854 in G1722 desert G2048 places G5117: and G2532 they came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to G4314 him G0846 from every quarter G3836.
002:001 ¶ And G2532 again G3825 he entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Capernaum G2584 after G1223 [some] days G2250; and G2532 it was noised G0191 (AorPasInd) that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) in G1519 the house G3624.
002:002 And G2532 straightway G2112 many G4183 were gathered together G4863 (AorPasInd), insomuch that G5620 there was G5562 no G3371 room to receive G5562 (PresActInf) [them], no, not so much G3366 as about G4314 the door G2374: and G2532 he preached G2980 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 unto them G0846.
002:003 And G2532 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846, bringing G5342 (PresActPtc) one sick of the palsy G3885, which was borne G0142 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 four G5064.
002:004 And G2532 when they could G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361 come nigh G4331 (AorActInf) unto him G0846 for G1223 the press G3793, they uncovered G0648 (AorActInd) the roof G4721 where G3699 he was G2258 (ImpfInd): and G2532 when they had broken [it] up G1846 (AorActPtc), they let down G5465 (PresActInd) the bed G2895 wherein G1909 G3739 the sick of the palsy G3885 lay G2621 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
002:005 When G1161 Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 faith G4102, he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto the sick of the palsy G3885, Son G5043, thy G4675 sins G0266 be forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671.
002:006 But G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) certain G5100 of the scribes G1122 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) there G1563, and G2532 reasoning G1260 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 their G0846 hearts G2588,
002:007 Why G5101 doth G2980 this G3778 [man] thus G3779 speak G2980 (PresActInd) blasphemies G0988? who G5101 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) forgive G0863 (PresActInf) sins G0266 but G1508 God G2316 only G1520?
002:008 And G2532 immediately G2112 when Jesus G2424 perceived G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) in his G0846 spirit G4151 that G3754 they so G3779 reasoned G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd) within G1722 themselves G1438, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 reason ye G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd) these things G5023 in G1722 your G5216 hearts G2588?
002:009 Whether G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf) to the sick of the palsy G3885, [Thy] sins G0266 be forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671; or G2228 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf), Arise G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2895, and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr)?
002:010 But G1161 that G2443 ye may know G1492 (PerfActSubj) that G3754 the Son G5207 of man G0444 hath G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 on G1909 earth G1093 to forgive G0863 (PresActInf) sins G0266, (he saith G3004 (PresActInd) to the sick of the palsy G3885,)
002:011 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Arise G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2895, and G2532 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 thine G4675 house G3624.
002:012 And G2532 immediately G2112 he arose G1453 (AorPasInd), took up G0142 (AorActPtc) the bed G2895, and G2532 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) before G1726 them all G3956; insomuch that G5620 they were G1839 all G3956 amazed G1839 (PresMidInf), and G2532 glorified G1392 (PresActInf) God G2316, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 We G1492 never G3763 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) it on this fashion G3779.
002:013 And G2532 he went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 by G3844 the sea side G2281; and G2532 all G3956 the multitude G3793 resorted G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846, and G2532 he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846.
002:014 And G2532 as he passed by G3855 (PresActPtc), he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) Levi G3018 the [son] of Alphaeus G0256 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G1909 the receipt of custom G5058, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427. And G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
002:015 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that G1722, as Jesus G0846 sat at meat G2621 (PresMidPasDepInf) in G1722 his G0846 house G3614, many G4183 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268 sat G4873 also G2532 together with G4873 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) Jesus G2424 and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101: for G1063 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) many G4183, and G2532 they followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
002:016 And G2532 when the scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 eat G2068 (PresActPtc) with G3326 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268, they said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101, How G5101 is it that G3754 he eateth G2068 (PresActInd) and G2532 drinketh G4095 (PresActInd) with G3326 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268?
002:017 When G2532 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, They that are whole G2480 (PresActPtc) have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 need G5532 of the physician G2395, but G0235 they that are G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560: I came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 to call G2564 (AorActInf) the righteous G1342, but G0235 sinners G0268 to G1519 repentance G3341.
002:018 And G2532 the disciples G3101 of John G2491 and G2532 of the Pharisees G5330 used G2258 (ImpfInd) to fast G3522 (PresActPtc): and G2532 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Why do G1302 G3522 the disciples G3101 of John G2491 and G2532 of the Pharisees G5330 fast G3522 (PresActInd), but G1161 thy G4674 disciples G3101 fast G3522 (PresActInd) not G3756?
002:019 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, G3361 Can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) the children G5207 of the bridechamber G3567 fast G3522 (PresActInf), while G1722 G3739 the bridegroom G3566 is G2076 (PresInd) with G3326 them G0846? as long as G3745 G5550 they have G2192 (PresActInd) the bridegroom G3566 with G3326 them G1438, they cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) fast G3522 (PresActInf).
002:020 But G1161 the days G2250 will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), when G3752 the bridegroom G3566 shall be taken away G0522 (AorPasSubj) from G0575 them G0846, and G2532 then G5119 shall they fast G3522 (FutActInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250.
002:021 No man G3762 also G2532 seweth G1976 (PresActInd) a piece G1915 of new G0046 cloth G4470 on G1909 an old G3820 garment G2440: else G1490 the new piece G2537 that filled it up G4138 taketh away G0142 (PresActInd) from G0846 the old G3820, and G2532 the rent G4978 is made G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) worse G5501.
002:022 And G2532 no man G3762 putteth G0906 (PresActInd) new G3501 wine G3631 into G1519 old G3820 bottles G0779: else G1490 the new G3501 wine G3631 doth burst G4486 (PresActInd) the bottles G0779, and G2532 the wine G3631 is spilled G1632 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the bottles G0779 will be marred G0622 (FutMidInd): but G0235 new G3501 wine G3631 must be put G0992 into G1519 new G2537 bottles G0779.
002:023 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that he G0846 went G3899 (PresMidPasDepInf) through G1223 the corn fields G4702 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521; and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd), as they went G3598 G4160 (PresActInf), to pluck G5089 (PresActPtc) the ears of corn G4719.
002:024 And G2532 the Pharisees G5330 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2396, why G5101 do they G4160 (PresActInd) on G1722 the sabbath day G4521 that which G3739 is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd)?
002:025 And G2532 he G0846 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Have ye never G3763 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) what G5101 David G1138 did G4160 (AorActInd), when G3753 he had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) need G5532, and G2532 was an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), he G0846, and G2532 they that were with G3326 him G0846?
002:026 How G4459 he went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3624 of God G2316 in the days G1909 of Abiathar G0008 the high priest G0749, and G2532 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) the shewbread G0740 G4286, which G3739 is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) but for G1508 the priests G2409, and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) also G2532 to them which were G5607 (PresPtc) with G4862 him G0846?
002:027 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, The sabbath G4521 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) for G1223 man G0444, and not G3756 man G0444 for G1223 the sabbath G4521:
002:028 Therefore G5620 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) Lord G2962 also G2532 of the sabbath G4521.
003:001 ¶ And G2532 he entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 into G1519 the synagogue G4864; and G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444 there G1563 which had G2192 (PresActPtc) a withered G3583 (PerfPasPtc) hand G5495.
003:002 And G2532 they watched G3906 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, whether G1487 he would heal G2323 (FutActInd) him G0846 on the sabbath day G4521; that G2443 they might accuse G2723 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
003:003 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the man G0444 which had G2192 (PresActPtc) the withered G3583 (PerfPasPtc) hand G5495, Stand G1453 (AorMidImpr) forth G1519 G3319.
003:004 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Is it lawful G1832 (PresInd) to do good G0015 (AorActInf) on the sabbath days G4521, or G2228 to do evil G2554 (AorActInf)? to save G4982 (AorActInf) life G5590, or G2228 to kill G0615 (AorActInf)? But G1161 they held their peace G4623 (ImpfActInd).
003:005 And G2532 when he had looked round about G4017 (AorMidPtc) on them G0846 with G3326 anger G3709, being grieved G4818 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for G1909 the hardness G4457 of their G0846 hearts G2588, he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the man G0444, Stretch forth G1614 (AorActImpr) thine G4675 hand G5495. And G2532 he stretched [it] out G1614 (AorActInd): and G2532 his G0846 hand G5495 was restored G0600 (AorPasInd) whole G5199 as G5613 the other G0243.
003:006 And G2532 the Pharisees G5330 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and straightway G2112 took G4160 (ImpfActInd) counsel G4824 with G3326 the Herodians G2265 against G2596 him G0846, how G3704 they might destroy G0622 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
003:007 But G2532 Jesus G2424 withdrew himself G0402 (AorActInd) with G3326 his G0846 disciples G3101 to G4314 the sea G2281: and G2532 a great G4183 multitude G4128 from G0575 Galilee G1056 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 from G0575 Judaea G2449,
003:008 And G2532 from G0575 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 from G0575 Idumaea G2401, and G2532 [from] beyond G4008 Jordan G2446; and G2532 they about G4012 Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, a great G4183 multitude G4128, when they had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) what great things G3745 he did G4160 (ImpfActInd), came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846.
003:009 And G2532 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to his G0846 disciples G3101, that G2443 a small ship G4142 should wait on G4342 (PresActSubj) him G0846 because G1223 of the multitude G3793, lest G3363 they should throng G2346 (PresActSubj) him G0846.
003:010 For G1063 he had healed G2323 (AorActInd) many G4183; insomuch that G5620 they pressed upon G1968 (PresActInf) him G0846 for to G2443 touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) him G0846, as many as G3745 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) plagues G3148.
003:011 And G2532 unclean G0169 spirits G4151, when G3752 they saw G2334 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, fell down before G4363 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
003:012 And G2532 he straitly G4183 charged G2008 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 that G3363 they should G4160 not G3363 make G4160 (AorActSubj) him G0846 known G5318.
003:013 And G2532 he goeth up G0305 (PresActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735, and G2532 calleth G4341 (PresMidPasDepInd) [unto him] whom G3739 he G0846 would G2309 (ImpfActInd): and G2532 they came G0565 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846.
003:014 And G2532 he ordained G4160 (AorActInd) twelve G1427, that G2443 they should be G5600 (PresSubj) with G3326 him G0846, and G2532 that G2443 he might send G0649 them G0846 forth G0649 (PresActSubj) to preach G2784 (PresActInf),
003:015 And G2532 to have G2192 (PresActInf) power G1849 to heal G2323 (PresActInf) sicknesses G3554, and G2532 to cast out G1544 (PresActInf) devils G1140:
003:016 And G2532 Simon G4613 he surnamed G2007 (AorActInd) G3686 Peter G4074;
003:017 And G2532 James G2385 the [son] G3588 of Zebedee G2199, and G2532 John G2491 the brother G0080 of James G2385; and G2532 he surnamed G2007 (AorActInd) G3686 them G0846 Boanerges G0993, which is G3603, The sons G5207 of thunder G1027:
003:018 And G2532 Andrew G0406, and G2532 Philip G5376, and G2532 Bartholomew G0918, and G2532 Matthew G3156, and G2532 Thomas G2381, and G2532 James G2385 the [son] G3588 of Alphaeus G0256, and G2532 Thaddaeus G2280, and G2532 Simon G4613 the Canaanite G2581,
003:019 And G2532 Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, which G3739 also G2532 betrayed G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846: and G2532 they went G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) into G1519 an house G3624.
003:020 And G2532 the multitude G3793 cometh together G4905 (PresMidPasDepInd) again G3825, so that G5620 they G0846 could G1410 (PresMidPasDepInf) not G3361 so much as G3383 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) bread G0740.
003:021 And G2532 when his G0846 friends G3844 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [of it], they went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to lay hold G2902 (AorActInf) on him G0846: for G1063 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 He is beside himself G1839 (Aor2ActInd).
003:022 And G2532 the scribes G1122 which G3588 came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Jerusalem G2414 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 He hath G2192 (PresActInd) Beelzebub G0954, G3754 and G2532 by G1722 the prince G0758 of the devils G1140 casteth he out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140.
003:023 And G2532 he called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846 [unto him], and said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 in G1722 parables G3850, How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) Satan G4567 cast out G1544 (PresActInf) Satan G4567?
003:024 And G2532 if G1437 a kingdom G0932 be divided G3307 (AorPasSubj) against G1909 itself G1438, that G1565 kingdom G0932 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) stand G2476 (AorPasInf).
003:025 And G2532 if G1437 a house G3614 be divided G3307 (AorPasSubj) against G1909 itself G1438, that G1565 house G3614 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) stand G2476 (AorPasInf).
003:026 And G2532 if G1487 Satan G4567 rise up G0450 (Aor2ActInd) against G1909 himself G1438, and G2532 be divided G3307 (PerfPasInd), he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) stand G2476 (AorPasInf), but G0235 hath G2192 (PresActInd) an end G5056.
003:027 No man G3762 can G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) enter G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a strong man’s G2478 house G3614, and spoil G1283 (AorActInf) his G0846 goods G4632, except G3362 he will G1210 first G4412 bind G1210 (AorActSubj) the strong man G2478; and G2532 then G5119 he will spoil G1283 (FutActInd) his G0846 house G3614.
003:028 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 All G3956 sins G0265 shall be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) unto the sons G5207 of men G0444, and G2532 blasphemies G0988 wherewith G3745 soever G0302 they shall blaspheme G0987 (AorActSubj):
003:029 But G1161 he G3739 that G0302 shall blaspheme G0987 (AorActSubj) against G1519 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 hath G2192 (PresActInd) never G3756 G1519 G0165 forgiveness G0859, but G0235 is G2076 (PresInd) in danger G1777 of eternal G0166 damnation G2920:
003:030 Because G3754 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), He hath G2192 (PresActInd) an unclean G0169 spirit G4151.
003:031 There came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) then G3767 his G0846 brethren G0080 and G2532 his mother G3384, and G2532, standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) without G1854, sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, calling G5455 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
003:032 And G2532 the multitude G3793 sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) about G4012 him G0846, and G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 mother G3384 and G2532 thy G4675 brethren G0080 without G1854 seek for G2212 (PresActInd) thee G4571.
003:033 And G2532 he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 mother G3384, or G2228 my G3450 brethren G0080?
003:034 And G2532 he looked G4017 (AorMidPtc) round about G2945 on them which G3588 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) about G4012 him G0846, and said G3004 (PresActInd), Behold G2396 my G3450 mother G3384 and G2532 my G3450 brethren G0080!
003:035 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) the will G2307 of God G2316, the same G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 brother G0080, and G2532 my G3450 sister G0079, and G2532 mother G3384.
004:001 ¶ And G2532 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) again G3825 to teach G1321 (PresActInf) by G3844 the sea side G2281: and G2532 there was gathered G4863 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 him G0846 a great G4183 multitude G3793, so that G5620 he G0846 entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143, and sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepInf) in G1722 the sea G2281; and G2532 the whole G3956 multitude G3793 was G2258 (ImpfInd) by G4314 the sea G2281 on G1909 the land G1093.
004:002 And G2532 he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 many things G4183 by G1722 parables G3850, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 in G1722 his G0846 doctrine G1322,
004:003 Hearken G0191 (PresActImpr); Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) a sower G4687 (PresActPtc) to sow G4687 (AorActInf):
004:004 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he sowed G4687 (PresActInf), some G3739 G3303 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) by G3844 the way side G3598, and G2532 the fowls G4071 of the air G3772 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 devoured G2719 it G0846 up G2719 (Aor2ActInd).
004:005 And G1161 some G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 stony ground G4075, where G3699 it had G2192 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 much G4183 earth G1093; and G2532 immediately G2112 it sprang up G1816 (AorActInd), because G1223 it had G2192 (PresActInf) no G3361 depth G0899 of earth G1093:
004:006 But G1161 when G0393 the sun G2246 was up G0393 (AorActPtc), it was scorched G2739 (AorPasInd); and G2532 because G1223 it had G2192 (PresActInf) no G3361 root G4491, it withered away G3583 (AorPasInd).
004:007 And G2532 some G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) among G1519 thorns G0173, and G2532 the thorns G0173 grew up G0305 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 choked G4846 (AorActInd) it G0846, and G2532 it yielded G1325 (AorActInd) no G3756 fruit G2590.
004:008 And G2532 other G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1519 good G2570 ground G1093, and G2532 did yield G1325 (ImpfActInd) fruit G2590 that sprang up G0305 (PresActPtc) and G2532 increased G0837 (PresActPtc); and G2532 brought forth G5342 (ImpfActInd), some G1520 thirty G5144, and G2532 some G1520 sixty G1835, and G2532 some G1520 an hundred G1540.
004:009 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
004:010 And G1161 when G3753 he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) alone G2651, they that were about G4012 him G0846 with G4862 the twelve G1427 asked G2065 (AorActInd) of him G0846 the parable G3850.
004:011 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Unto you G5213 it is given G1325 (PerfPasInd) to know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the mystery G3466 of the kingdom G0932 of God G2316: but G1161 unto them G1565 that are without G1854, all [these] things G3956 are done G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) in G1722 parables G3850:
004:012 That G2443 seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) they may see G0991 (PresActSubj), and G2532 not G3361 perceive G1492 (Aor2ActSubj); and G2532 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) they may hear G0191 (PresActSubj), and G2532 not G3361 understand G4920 (PresActSubj); lest at any time G3379 they should be converted G1994 (AorActSubj), and G2532 [their] sins G0265 should be forgiven G0863 (AorPasSubj) them G0846.
004:013 And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 this G5026 parable G3850? and G2532 how then G4459 will ye know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) all G3956 parables G3850?
004:014 The sower G4687 (PresActPtc) soweth G4687 (PresActInd) the word G3056.
004:015 And G1161 these G3778 are they G1526 (PresInd) by G3844 the way side G3598, where G3699 the word G3056 is sown G4687 (PresPasInd); but G2532 when G3752 they have heard G0191 (AorActSubj), Satan G4567 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) immediately G2112, and G2532 taketh away G0142 (PresActInd) the word G3056 that was sown G4687 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 their G0846 hearts G2588.
004:016 And G2532 these G3778 are they G1526 (PresInd) likewise G3668 which are sown G4687 (PresPasPtc) on G1909 stony ground G4075; who G3739, when G3752 they have heard G0191 (AorActSubj) the word G3056, immediately G2112 receive G2983 (PresActInd) it G0846 with G3326 gladness G5479;
004:017 And G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 root G4491 in G1722 themselves G1438, and G0235 so endure G1526 (PresInd) but for a time G4340: afterward G1534, when affliction G2347 or G2228 persecution G1375 ariseth G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) for G1223 the word’s sake G3056, immediately G2112 they are offended G4624 (PresPasInd).
004:018 And G2532 these G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) they which are G1526 (PresInd) sown G4687 (PresPasPtc) among G1519 thorns G0173; such as G3778 hear G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056,
004:019 And G2532 the cares G3308 of this G5127 world G0165, and G2532 the deceitfulness G0539 of riches G4149, and G2532 the lusts G1939 of G4012 other things G3062 entering in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc), choke G4846 (PresActInd) the word G3056, and G2532 it becometh G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) unfruitful G0175.
004:020 And G2532 these G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) they which are sown G4687 (Aor2PasPtc) on G1909 good G2570 ground G1093; such as G3748 hear G0191 (PresActInd) the word G3056, and G2532 receive G3858 (PresMidPasDepInd) [it], and G2532 bring forth fruit G2592 (PresActInd), some G1520 thirtyfold G5144, some G2532 G1520 sixty G1835, and G2532 some G1520 an hundred G1540.
004:021 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Is G3385 a candle G3088 brought G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G2443 be put G5087 (AorPasSubj) under G5259 a bushel G3426, or G2228 under G5259 a bed G2825? and not G3756 to G2443 be set G2007 (AorPasSubj) on G1909 a candlestick G3087?
004:022 For G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3756 hid G2927 G5100, which G3739 shall G5319 not G3362 be manifested G5319 (AorPasSubj); neither G3761 was any thing kept G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) secret G0614, but G0235 that G2443 it should come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) abroad G1519 G5318.
004:023 If any man G1536 have G2192 (PresActInd) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
004:024 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) what G5101 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd): with G1722 what G3739 measure G3358 ye mete G3354 (PresActInd), it shall be measured G3354 (FutPasInd) to you G5213: and G2532 unto you G5213 that hear G0191 (PresActPtc) shall more be given G4369 (FutPasInd).
004:025 For G1063 G0302 he that G3739 hath G2192 (PresActSubj), to him G0846 shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd): and G2532 he that G3739 hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756, from G0575 him G0846 shall be taken G0142 (FutPasInd) even G2532 that which G3739 he hath G2192 (PresActInd).
004:026 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), So G3779 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, as G5613 if G1437 a man G0444 should cast G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) seed G4703 into G1909 the ground G1093;
004:027 And G2532 should sleep G2518 (PresActSubj), and G2532 rise G1453 (PresPasSubj) night G3571 and G2532 day G2250, and G2532 the seed G4703 should spring G0985 (PresActSubj) and G2532 grow up G3373 (PresPasSubj), he G0846 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 how G5613.
004:028 For G1063 the earth G1093 bringeth forth fruit G2592 (PresActInd) of herself G0844; first G4412 the blade G5528, then G1534 the ear G4719, after that G1534 the full G4134 corn G4621 in G1722 the ear G4719.
004:029 But G1161 when G3752 the fruit G2590 is brought forth G3860 (Aor2ActSubj), immediately G2112 he putteth in G0649 (PresActInd) the sickle G1407, because G3754 the harvest G2326 is come G3936 (PerfActInd).
004:030 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Whereunto G5101 shall we liken G3666 (AorActSubj) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316? or G2228 with G1722 what G4169 comparison G3850 shall we compare G3846 (Aor2ActSubj) it G0846?
004:031 [It is] like G5613 a grain G2848 of mustard seed G4615, which G3739, when G3752 it is sown G4687 (Aor2PasSubj) in G1909 the earth G1093, is less G3398 than all G3956 the seeds G4690 that be G2076 (PresInd) in G1909 the earth G1093:
004:032 But G2532 when G3752 it is sown G4687 (Aor2PasSubj), it groweth up G0305 (PresActInd), and G2532 becometh G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) greater than G3187 all G3956 herbs G3001, and G2532 shooteth out G4160 (PresActInd) great G3173 branches G2798; so that G5620 the fowls G4071 of the air G3772 may G1410 (PresMidPasDepInf) lodge G2681 (PresActInf) under G5259 the shadow G4639 of it G0846.
004:033 And G2532 with many G4183 such G5108 parables G3850 spake he G2980 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 unto them G0846, as G2531 they were able G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to hear G0191 (PresActInf) [it].
004:034 But G1161 without G5565 a parable G3850 spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) he not G3756 unto them G0846: and G1161 when they were alone G2398 G2596, he expounded G1956 (ImpfActInd) all things G3956 to his G0846 disciples G3101.
004:035 And G2532 the G1722 same G1565 day G2250, when the even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Let us pass over G1330 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G1519 the other side G4008.
004:036 And G2532 when they had sent away G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) the multitude G3793, they took G3880 (PresActInd) him G0846 even as G5613 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the ship G4143. And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) also G2532 with G3326 him G0846 other G0243 little ships G4142.
004:037 And G2532 there arose G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) a great G3173 storm G2978 of wind G0417, and G1161 the waves G2949 beat G1911 (ImpfActInd) into G1519 the ship G4143, so that G5620 it G0846 was G1072 now G2235 full G1072 (PresPasInf).
004:038 And G2532 he G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1909 the hinder part of the ship G4403, asleep G2518 (PresActPtc) on G1909 a pillow G4344: and G2532 they awake G1326 (PresActInd) him G0846, and G2532 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, carest G3199 (PresActInd) thou G4671 not G3756 that G3754 we perish G0622 (PresMidInd)?
004:039 And G2532 he arose G1326 (AorPasPtc), and rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the wind G0417, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the sea G2281, Peace G4623 (PresActImpr), be still G5392 (PerfPasImpr). And G2532 the wind G0417 ceased G2869 (AorActInd), and G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 calm G1055.
004:040 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 are ye G2075 (PresInd) so G3779 fearful G1169? how is it G4459 that ye have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 faith G4102?
004:041 And G2532 they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) exceedingly G5401 G3173, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) one G0240 to G4314 another G0240, What G5101 manner of man G0686 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778, that G3754 even G2532 the wind G0417 and G2532 the sea G2281 obey G5219 (PresActInd) him G0846?
005:001 ¶ And G2532 they came over G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 the other side G4008 of the sea G2281, into G1519 the country G5561 of the Gadarenes G1046.
005:002 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the ship G4143, immediately G2112 there met G0528 (AorActInd) him G0846 out of G1537 the tombs G3419 a man G0444 with G1722 an unclean G0169 spirit G4151,
005:003 Who G3739 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) [his] dwelling G2731 among G1722 the tombs G3419; and G2532 no man G3762 could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) bind G1210 (AorActInf) him G0846, no, not G3777 with chains G0254:
005:004 Because G1223 that he G0846 had been often G4178 bound G1210 (PerfPasInf) with fetters G3976 and G2532 chains G0254, and G2532 the chains G0254 had been plucked asunder G1288 (PerfPasInf) by G5259 him G0846, and G2532 the fetters G3976 broken in pieces G4937 (PerfPasInf): neither G2532 could G2480 (ImpfActInd) any [man] tame G1150 (AorActInf) him G0846 G3762.
005:005 And G2532 always G1275, night G3571 and G2532 day G2250, he was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the mountains G3735, and G2532 in G1722 the tombs G3418, crying G2896 (PresActPtc), and G2532 cutting G2629 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 with stones G3037.
005:006 But G1161 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424 afar off G0575 G3113, he ran G5143 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846,
005:007 And G2532 cried G2896 (AorActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 have I G1698 to do G2532 with thee G4671, Jesus G2424, [thou] Son G5207 of the most high G5310 God G2316? I adjure G3726 (PresActInd) thee G4571 by God G2316, that thou torment G0928 (AorActSubj) me G3165 not G3361.
005:008 For G1063 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, Come G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 the man G0444, [thou] unclean G0169 spirit G4151.
005:009 And G2532 he asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, What G5101 [is] thy G4671 name G3686? And G2532 he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), My G3427 name G3686 [is] Legion G3003: for G3754 we are G2070 (PresInd) many G4183.
005:010 And G2532 he besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 much G4183 that G3363 he would G0649 not G3363 send G0649 them G0846 away G0649 (AorActSubj) out of G1854 the country G5561.
005:011 Now G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 nigh G4314 unto the mountains G3735 a great G3173 herd G0034 of swine G5519 feeding G1006 (PresPasPtc).
005:012 And G2532 all G3956 the devils G1142 besought G3870 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Send G3992 (AorActImpr) us G2248 into G1519 the swine G5519, that G2443 we may enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 them G0846.
005:013 And G2532 forthwith G2112 Jesus G2424 gave G2010 them G0846 leave G2010 (AorActInd). And G2532 the unclean G0169 spirits G4151 went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the swine G5519: and G2532 the herd G0034 ran G3729 (AorActInd) violently down G2596 a steep place G2911 into G1519 the sea G2281, G1161 (they were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5613 two thousand G1367;) and G2532 were choked G4155 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 the sea G2281.
005:014 And G1161 they that fed G1006 (PresActPtc) the swine G5519 fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 told G0312 (AorActInd) [it] in G1519 the city G4172, and G2532 in G1519 the country G0068. And G2532 they went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) what G5101 it was G2076 (PresInd) that was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc).
005:015 And G2532 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 Jesus G2424, and G2532 see G2334 (PresActInd) him that was possessed with the devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and had G2192 (PerfActPtc) the legion G3003, sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 clothed G2439 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 in his right mind G4993 (PresActPtc): and G2532 they were afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd).
005:016 And G2532 they that saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it] told G1334 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 how G4459 it befell G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) to him that was possessed with the devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 [also] concerning G4012 the swine G5519.
005:017 And G2532 they began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to pray G3870 (PresActInf) him G0846 to depart G0565 (Aor2ActInf) out of G0575 their G0846 coasts G3725.
005:018 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ship G4143, he that had been possessed with the devil G1139 (AorPasDepPtc) prayed G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he might be G5600 (PresSubj) with G3326 him G0846.
005:019 Howbeit G1161 Jesus G2424 suffered G0863 (AorActInd) him G0846 not G3756, but G0235 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Go G5217 (PresActImpr) home G1519 G3624 G4675 to G4314 thy friends G4674, and G2532 tell G0312 (AorActImpr) them G0846 how great things G3745 the Lord G2962 hath done G4160 (AorActInd) for thee G4671, and G2532 hath had compassion G1653 (AorActInd) on thee G4571.
005:020 And G2532 he departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to publish G2784 (PresActInf) in G1722 Decapolis G1179 how great things G3745 Jesus G2424 had done G4160 (AorActInd) for him G0846: and G2532 all G3956 [men] did marvel G2296 (ImpfActInd).
005:021 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 was passed over G1276 (AorActPtc) again G3825 by G1722 ship G4143 unto G1519 the other side G4008, much G4183 people G3793 gathered G4863 (AorPasInd) unto G1909 him G0846: and G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh G3844 unto the sea G2281.
005:022 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) one G1520 of the rulers of the synagogue G0752, Jairus G2383 by name G3686; and G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, he fell G4098 (PresActInd) at G4314 his G0846 feet G4228,
005:023 And G2532 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 greatly G4183, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 My G3450 little daughter G2365 lieth G2079 at the point of death G2192 (PresActInd): [I pray thee], come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and G2443 lay G2007 (Aor2ActSubj) thy hands G5495 on her G0846, that G3704 she may be healed G4982 (AorPasSubj); and G2532 she shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd).
005:024 And G2532 [Jesus] went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) with G3326 him G0846; and G2532 much G4183 people G3793 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 thronged G4918 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
005:025 And G2532 a certain G5100 woman G1135, which had an G1722 issue G4511 of blood G0129 G5607 (PresPtc) twelve G1427 years G2094,
005:026 And G2532 had suffered G3958 (Aor2ActPtc) many things G4183 of G5259 many G4183 physicians G2395, and G2532 had spent G1159 (AorActPtc) all G3956 that she G1438 had G3844, and G2532 was G5623 nothing G3367 bettered G5623 (AorPasPtc), but G0235 rather G3123 grew G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) worse G1519 G5501,
005:027 When she had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of G4012 Jesus G2424, came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) in G1722 the press G3793 behind G3693, and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 garment G2440.
005:028 For G1063 she said G3004 (ImpfActInd), If G3754 G2579 I may touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) but G2579 his G0846 clothes G2440, I shall be whole G4982 (FutPasInd).
005:029 And G2532 straightway G2112 the fountain G4077 of her G0846 blood G0129 was dried up G3583 (AorPasInd); and G2532 she felt G1097 (Aor2ActInd) in [her] body G4983 that G3754 she was healed G2390 (PerfPasInd) of G0575 that plague G3148.
005:030 And G2532 Jesus G2424, immediately G2112 knowing G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) in G1722 himself G1438 that virtue G1411 had gone G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 him G0846, turned him about G1994 (Aor2PasPtc) in G1722 the press G3793, and said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Who G5101 touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) my G3450 clothes G2440?
005:031 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, Thou seest G0991 (PresActInd) the multitude G3793 thronging G4918 (PresActPtc) thee G4571, and G2532 sayest thou G3004 (PresActInd), Who G5101 touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) me G3450?
005:032 And G2532 he looked round about G4017 (ImpfMidInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) her that had done G4160 (AorActPtc) this thing G5124.
005:033 But G1161 the woman G1135 fearing G5399 (AorPasDepPtc) and G2532 trembling G5141 (PresActPtc), knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) what G3739 was done G1096 (Perf2ActInd) in G1909 her G0846, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 fell down before G4363 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 all G3956 the truth G0225.
005:034 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Daughter G2364, thy G4675 faith G4102 hath made G4982 thee G4571 whole G4982 (PerfActInd); go G5217 (PresActImpr) in G1519 peace G1515, and G2532 be G2468 (PresImpr) whole G5199 of G0575 thy G4675 plague G3148.
005:035 While G2089 he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), there came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) from G0575 the ruler of the synagogue’s G0752 [house certain] which said G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Thy G4675 daughter G2364 is dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd): why G5101 troublest thou G4660 (PresActInd) the Master G1320 any further G2089?
005:036 As soon as G1161 G2112 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) the word G3056 that was spoken G2980 (PresPasPtc), he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the ruler of the synagogue G0752, Be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr), only G3440 believe G4100 (PresActImpr).
005:037 And G2532 he suffered G0863 (AorActInd) G3756 no man G3762 to follow G4870 (AorActInf) him G0846, save G1508 Peter G4074, and G2532 James G2385, and G2532 John G2491 the brother G0080 of James G2385.
005:038 And G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 the house G3624 of the ruler of the synagogue G0752, and G2532 seeth G2334 (PresActInd) the tumult G2351, and them that wept G2799 (PresActPtc) and G2532 wailed G0214 (PresActPtc) greatly G4183.
005:039 And G2532 when he was come in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 make ye this ado G2350 (PresPasInd), and G2532 weep G2799 (PresActInd)? the damsel G3813 is G0599 not G3756 dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd), but G0235 sleepeth G2518 (PresActInd).
005:040 And G2532 they laughed G2606 him G0846 to scorn G2606 (ImpfActInd). But G1161 when he had put G1544 them all G0537 out G1544 (Aor2ActPtc), he taketh G3880 (PresActInd) the father G3962 and G2532 the mother G3384 of the damsel G3813, and G2532 them that were with G3326 him G0846, and G2532 entereth in G1531 (PresMidPasDepInd) where G3699 the damsel G3813 was G2258 (ImpfInd) lying G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
005:041 And G2532 he took G2902 (AorActPtc) the damsel G3813 by the hand G5495, and said G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Talitha G5008 cumi G2891; which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd), being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc), Damsel G2877, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, arise G1453 (AorMidImpr).
005:042 And G2532 straightway G2112 the damsel G2877 arose G0450 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd); for G1063 she was G2258 (ImpfInd) [of the age] of twelve G1427 years G2094. And G2532 they were astonished G1839 (Aor2ActInd) with a great G3173 astonishment G1611.
005:043 And G2532 he charged G1291 (AorMidInd) them G0846 straitly G4183 that G2443 no man G3367 should know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) it G5124; and G2532 commanded G2036 (Aor2ActInd) that something should be given G1325 (AorPasInf) her G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf).
006:001 ¶ And G2532 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from thence G1564, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 his own G0846 country G3968; and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 follow G0190 (PresActInd) him G0846.
006:002 And G2532 when the sabbath day G4521 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to teach G1321 (PresActInf) in G1722 the synagogue G4864: and G2532 many G4183 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) [him] were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), From whence G4159 hath this G5129 [man] these things G5023? and G2532 what G5101 wisdom G4678 [is] this which is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) unto him G0846, that G3754 even G2532 such G5108 mighty works G1411 are wrought G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) by G1223 his G0846 hands G5495?
006:003 Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 the carpenter G5045, the son G5207 of Mary G3137, G1161 the brother G0080 of James G2385, and G2532 Joses G2500, and G2532 of Juda G2455, and G2532 Simon G4613? and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756 his G0846 sisters G0079 here G5602 with G4314 us G2248? And G2532 they were offended G4624 (ImpfPasInd) at G1722 him G0846.
006:004 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 G3754, A prophet G4396 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 without honour G0820, but G1508 in G1722 his own G0846 country G3968, and G2532 among G1722 his own kin G4773, and G2532 in G1722 his own G0846 house G3614.
006:005 And G2532 he could G3756 G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) there G1563 do G4160 (AorActInf) no G3762 mighty work G1411, save G1508 that he laid G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) his hands G5495 upon a few G3641 sick folk G0732, and healed G2323 (AorActInd) [them].
006:006 And G2532 he marvelled G2296 (ImpfActInd) because G1223 of their G0846 unbelief G0570. And G2532 he went G4013 (ImpfActInd) round about G2945 the villages G2968, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc).
006:007 And G2532 he called G4341 (PresMidPasDepInd) [unto him] the twelve G1427, and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to send G0649 them G0846 forth G0649 (PresActInf) by two G1417 and two G1417; and G2532 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 power over G1849 unclean G0169 spirits G4151;
006:008 And G2532 commanded G3853 (AorActInd) them G0846 that G2443 they should take G0142 (PresActSubj) nothing G3367 for G1519 [their] journey G3598, save G1508 a staff G4464 only G3440; no G3361 scrip G4082, no G3361 bread G0740, no G3361 money G5475 in G1519 [their] purse G2223:
006:009 But G0235 [be] shod G5265 (PerfPasPtc) with sandals G4547; and G2532 not G3361 put on G1746 (AorMidSubj) G1746 (AorMidInf) two G1417 coats G5509.
006:010 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, In what place soever G3699 G1437 ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 an house G3614, there G1563 abide G3306 (PresActImpr) till G2193 G0302 ye depart G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) from that place G1564.
006:011 And G2532 whosoever G3745 G0302 shall G1209 not G3361 receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) you G5209, nor G3366 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) you G5216, when ye depart G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thence G1564, shake off G1621 (AorActImpr) the dust G5522 under G5270 your G5216 feet G4228 for G1519 a testimony G3142 against them G0846. Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, It shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 for Sodom G4670 and G2228 Gomorrha G1116 in G1722 the day G2250 of judgment G2920, than G2228 for that G1565 city G4172.
006:012 And G2532 they went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and preached G2784 (ImpfActInd) that G2443 men should repent G3340 (AorActSubj).
006:013 And G2532 they cast out G1544 (ImpfActInd) many G4183 devils G1140, and G2532 anointed G0218 (ImpfActInd) with oil G1637 many G4183 that were sick G0732, and G2532 healed G2323 (ImpfActInd) [them].
006:014 And G2532 king G0935 Herod G2264 heard G0191 (AorActInd) [of him]; (for G1063 his G0846 name G3686 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) spread abroad G5318:) and G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), That G3754 John G2491 the Baptist G0907 (PresActPtc) was risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, and G2532 therefore G1223 G5124 mighty works G1411 do shew forth themselves G1754 (PresActInd) in G1722 him G0846.
006:015 Others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), That G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) Elias G2243. And G1161 others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), That G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) a prophet G4396, or G2228 as G5613 one of G1520 the prophets G4396.
006:016 But G1161 when Herod G2264 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [thereof], he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) John G2491, whom G3754 G3739 I G1473 beheaded G0607 (AorActInd): he G0846 is risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498.
006:017 For G1063 Herod G2264 himself G0846 had sent forth G0649 (AorActPtc) and laid hold G2902 (AorActInd) upon John G2491, and G2532 bound G1210 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 prison G5438 for G1223 Herodias G2266 ’ sake G1223, his G0846 brother G0080 Philip’s G5376 wife G1135: for G3754 he had married G1060 (AorActInd) her G0846.
006:018 For G1063 John G2491 had said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto Herod G2264, G3754 It is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for thee G4671 to have G2192 (PresActInf) thy G4675 brother’s G0080 wife G1135.
006:019 Therefore G1161 Herodias G2266 had a quarrel G1758 (ImpfActInd) against him G0846, and G2532 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have killed G0615 (AorActInf) him G0846; but G2532 she could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756:
006:020 For G1063 Herod G2264 feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) John G2491, knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that he G0846 was a just G1342 man G0435 and G2532 an holy G0040, and G2532 observed G4933 (ImpfActInd) him G0846; and G2532 when he heard G0191 (AorActPtc) him G0846, he did G4160 (ImpfActInd) many things G4183, and G2532 heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 gladly G2234.
006:021 And G2532 when a convenient G2121 day G2250 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), that G3753 Herod G2264 on his G0846 birthday G1077 made G4160 (ImpfActInd) a supper G1173 to his G0846 lords G3175, G2532 high captains G5506, and G2532 chief G4413 [estates] of Galilee G1056;
006:022 And G2532 when the daughter G2364 of the said G0846 Herodias G2266 came in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 danced G3738 (AorMidDepPtc), and G2532 pleased G0700 (AorActPtc) Herod G2264 and G2532 them that sat with him G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc), the king G0935 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the damsel G2877, Ask G0154 (AorActImpr) of me G3165 whatsoever G3739 G1437 thou wilt G2309 (PresActSubj), and G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) [it] thee G4671.
006:023 And G2532 he sware G3660 (AorActInd) unto her G0846, Whatsoever G3754 G3739 G1437 thou shalt ask G0154 (AorActSubj) of me G3165, I will give G1325 (FutActInd) [it] thee G4671, unto G2193 the half G2255 of my G3450 kingdom G0932.
006:024 And G1161 she went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846 mother G3384, What G5101 shall I ask G0154 (FutMidInd)? And G1161 she said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The head G2776 of John G2491 the Baptist G0910.
006:025 And G2532 she came in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) straightway G2112 with G3326 haste G4710 unto G4314 the king G0935, and asked G0154 (AorMidInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I will G2309 (PresActInd) that G2443 thou give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) me G3427 by and by G1824 in G1909 a charger G4094 the head G2776 of John G2491 the Baptist G0910.
006:026 And G2532 the king G0935 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) exceeding sorry G4036; [yet] for G1223 his oath’s sake G3727, and G2532 for their sakes which G3588 sat with him G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc), he would G2309 (AorActInd) not G3756 reject G0114 (AorActInf) her G0846.
006:027 And G2532 immediately G2112 the king G0935 sent G0649 (AorActPtc) an executioner G4688, and commanded G2004 (AorActInd) his G0846 head G2776 to be brought G5342 (AorPasInf): and G1161 he went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and beheaded G0607 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the prison G5438,
006:028 And G2532 brought G5342 (AorActInd) his G0846 head G2776 in G1909 a charger G4094, and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) it G0846 to the damsel G2877: and G2532 the damsel G2877 gave G1325 (AorActInd) it G0846 to her G0846 mother G3384.
006:029 And G2532 when his G0846 disciples G3101 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [of it], they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 took up G0142 (AorActInd) his G0846 corpse G4430, and G2532 laid G5087 (AorActInd) it G0846 in G1722 a tomb G3419.
006:030 And G2532 the apostles G0652 gathered themselves together G4863 (PresPasInd) unto G4314 Jesus G2424, and G2532 told G0518 (AorActInd) him G0846 all things G3956, both G2532 what G3745 they had done G4160 (AorActInd), and G2532 what G3745 they had taught G1321 (AorActInd).
006:031 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Come G1205 (Impr) ye G5210 yourselves G0846 apart G2596 G2398 into G1519 a desert G2048 place G5117, and G2532 rest G0373 (PresMidImpr) a while G3641: for G1063 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) many G4183 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 going G5217 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they had no G3761 leisure G2119 (ImpfActInd) so much as G3761 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf).
006:032 And G2532 they departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a desert G2048 place G5117 by ship G4143 privately G2596 G2398.
006:033 And G2532 the people G3793 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 departing G5217 (PresActPtc), and G2532 many G4183 knew G1921 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 ran G4936 (Aor2ActInd) afoot G3979 thither G1563 out of G0575 all G3956 cities G4172, and G2532 outwent G4281 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846, and G2532 came together G4905 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846.
006:034 And G2532 Jesus G2424, when he came out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) much G4183 people G3793, and G2532 was moved with compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd) toward G1909 them G0846, because G3754 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) as G5613 sheep G4263 not G3361 having G2192 (PresActPtc) a shepherd G4166: and G2532 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to teach G1321 (PresActInf) them G0846 many things G4183.
006:035 And G2532 when the day G5610 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) now G2235 far spent G4183, his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) unto him G0846, and said G3004 (PresActInd), G3754 This is G2076 (PresInd) a desert G2048 place G5117, and G2532 now G2235 the time G5610 [is] far passed G4183:
006:036 Send G0630 them G0846 away G0630 (AorActImpr), that G2443 they may go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the country G0068 round about G2945, and G2532 into the villages G2968, and buy G0059 (AorActSubj) themselves G1438 bread G0740: for G1063 they have G2192 (PresActInd) nothing G5101 G3756 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj).
006:037 He answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) ye G5210 them G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf). And G2532 they say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Shall we go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and buy G0059 (AorActSubj) two hundred G1250 pennyworth G1220 of bread G0740, and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) them G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf)?
006:038  G1161 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, How many G4214 loaves G0740 have ye G2192 (PresActInd)? go G5217 (PresActImpr) and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActImpr). And G2532 when they knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc), they say G3004 (PresActInd), Five G4002, and G2532 two G1417 fishes G2486.
006:039 And G2532 he commanded G2004 (AorActInd) them G0846 to make G0347 all G3956 sit down G0347 (AorActInf) by companies G4849 G4849 upon G1909 the green G5515 grass G5528.
006:040 And G2532 they sat down G0377 (Aor2ActInd) in ranks G4237 G4237, by G0303 hundreds G1540, and G2532 by G0303 fifties G4004.
006:041 And G2532 when he had taken G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the five G4002 loaves G0740 and G2532 the two G1417 fishes G2486, he looked up G0308 (AorActPtc) to G1519 heaven G3772, and blessed G2127 (AorActInd), and G2532 brake G2622 (AorActInd) the loaves G0740, and G2532 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) [them] to his G0846 disciples G3101 to G2443 set before G3908 (Aor2ActSubj) them G0846; and G2532 the two G1417 fishes G2486 divided he G3307 (AorActInd) among them all G3956.
006:042 And G2532 they did G5315 all G3956 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd).
006:043 And G2532 they took up G0142 (AorActInd) twelve G1427 baskets G2894 full G4134 of the fragments G2801, and G2532 of G0575 the fishes G2486.
006:044 And G2532 they that did eat G5315 (Aor2ActPtc) of the loaves G0740 were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 five thousand G4000 men G0435.
006:045 And G2532 straightway G2112 he constrained G0315 (AorActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101 to get G1684 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the ship G4143, and G2532 to go G4254 to G1519 the other side G4008 before G4254 (PresActInf) unto G4314 Bethsaida G0966, while G2193 he G0846 sent away G0630 (AorActSubj) the people G3793.
006:046 And G2532 when he had sent G0657 them G0846 away G0657 (AorMidPtc), he departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf).
006:047 And G2532 when even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), the ship G4143 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the midst G3319 of the sea G2281, and G2532 he G0846 alone G3441 on G1909 the land G1093.
006:048 And G2532 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 toiling G0928 (PresPasPtc) in G1722 rowing G1643 (PresActInf); for G1063 the wind G0417 was G2258 (ImpfInd) contrary G1727 unto them G0846: and G2532 about G4012 the fourth G5067 watch G5438 of the night G3571 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 them G0846, walking G4043 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the sea G2281, and G2532 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have passed by G3928 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846.
006:049 But G1161 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 walking G4043 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the sea G2281, they supposed G1380 (AorActInd) it had been G1511 (PresInf) a spirit G5326, and G2532 cried out G0349 (AorActInd):
006:050 For G1063 they all G3956 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 were troubled G5015 (AorPasInd). And G2532 immediately G2112 he talked G2980 (AorActInd) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Be of good cheer G2293 (PresActImpr): it is G1510 (PresInd) I G1473; be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr).
006:051 And G2532 he went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 into G1519 the ship G4143; and G2532 the wind G0417 ceased G2869 (AorActInd): and G2532 they were sore G3029 amazed G1839 (ImpfMidInd) in G1722 themselves G1438 beyond G1537 measure G4053, and G2532 wondered G2296 (ImpfActInd).
006:052 For G1063 they considered G4920 (AorActInd) not G3756 [the miracle] of G1909 the loaves G0740: for G1063 their G0846 heart G2588 was G2258 (ImpfInd) hardened G4456 (PerfPasPtc).
006:053 And G2532 when they had passed over G1276 (AorActPtc), they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 the land G1093 of Gennesaret G1082, and G2532 drew to the shore G4358 (AorPasInd).
006:054 And G2532 when they G0846 were come G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the ship G4143, straightway G2112 they knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846,
006:055 And ran through G4063 (Aor2ActPtc) that G1565 whole G3650 region round about G4066, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to carry about G4064 (PresActInf) in G1909 beds G2895 those that were G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560, where G3699 they heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) he was G3754 G1563 G2076 (PresInd).
006:056 And G2532 whithersoever G3699 G0302 he entered G1531 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), into G1519 villages G2968, or G2228 cities G4172, or G2228 country G0068, they laid G5087 (ImpfActInd) the sick G0770 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the streets G0058, and G2532 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 they might touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) if G2579 it were but G2579 the border G2899 of his G0846 garment G2440: and G2532 as many G3745 as G0302 touched G0680 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846 were made whole G4982 (ImpfPasInd).
007:001 ¶ Then G2532 came together G4863 (PresPasInd) unto G4314 him G0846 the Pharisees G5330, and G2532 certain G5100 of the scribes G1122, which came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Jerusalem G2414.
007:002 And G2532 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) some G5100 of his G0846 disciples G3101 eat G2068 (PresActPtc) bread G0740 with defiled G2839, that is to say G5123 (PresInd), with unwashen G0449, hands G5495, they found fault G3201 (AorMidDepInd).
007:003 For G1063 the Pharisees G5330, and G2532 all G3956 the Jews G2453, except G3362 they wash G3538 (AorMidSubj) [their] hands G5495 oft G4435, eat G2068 (PresActInd) not G3756, holding G2902 (PresActPtc) the tradition G3862 of the elders G4245.
007:004 And G2532 [when they come] from G0575 the market G0058, except G3362 they wash G0907 (AorMidSubj), they eat G2068 (PresActInd) not G3756. And G2532 many G4183 other things G0243 there be G2076 (PresInd), which G3739 they have received G3880 (Aor2ActInd) to hold G2902 (PresActInf), [as] the washing G0909 of cups G4221, and G2532 pots G3582, G2532 brasen vessels G5473, and G2532 of tables G2825.
007:005 Then G1899 the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 scribes G1122 asked G1905 (PresActInd) him G0846, Why G1302 walk G4043 (PresActInd) not G3756 thy G4675 disciples G3101 according G2596 to the tradition G3862 of the elders G4245, but G0235 eat G2068 (PresActInd) bread G0740 with unwashen G0449 hands G5495?
007:006 He answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 Well G2573 hath Esaias G2268 prophesied G4395 (AorActInd) of G4012 you G5216 hypocrites G5273, as G5613 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), This G3778 people G2992 honoureth G5091 (PresActInd) me G3165 with [their] lips G5491, but G1161 their G0846 heart G2588 is G0568 (PresActInd) far G4206 from G0575 me G1700.
007:007 Howbeit G1161 in vain G3155 do they worship G4576 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G3165, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) [for] doctrines G1319 the commandments G1778 of men G0444.
007:008 For G1063 laying aside G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) the commandment G1785 of God G2316, ye hold G2902 (PresActInd) the tradition G3862 of men G0444, [as] the washing G0909 of pots G3582 and G2532 cups G4221: and G2532 many G4183 other G0243 such G5108 like things G3946 ye do G4160 (PresActInd).
007:009 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Full well G2573 ye reject G0114 (PresActInd) the commandment G1785 of God G2316, that G2443 ye may keep G5083 (AorActSubj) your own G5216 tradition G3862.
007:010 For G1063 Moses G3475 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Honour G5091 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 father G3962 and G2532 thy G4675 mother G3384; and G2532, Whoso curseth G2551 (PresActPtc) father G3962 or G2228 mother G3384, let him die G5053 (PresActImpr) the death G2288:
007:011 But G1161 ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd), If G1437 a man G0444 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) to his father G3962 or G2228 mother G3384, [It is] Corban G2878, that is to say G3603, a gift G1435, by G1537 whatsoever G3739 G1437 thou mightest be profited by G5623 (AorPasSubj) me G1700; [he shall be free].
007:012 And G2532 ye suffer G0863 (PresActInd) him G0846 no more G3765 to do G4160 (AorActInf) ought G3762 for his G0846 father G3962 or G2228 his G0846 mother G3384;
007:013 Making G0208 the word G3056 of God G2316 of none effect G0208 (PresActPtc) through your G5216 tradition G3862, which G3739 ye have delivered G3860 (AorActInd): and G2532 many G4183 such G5108 like things G3946 do ye G4160 (PresActInd).
007:014 And G2532 when he had called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) all G3956 the people G3793 [unto him], he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Hearken G0191 (PresActImpr) unto me G3450 every one G3956 [of you], and G2532 understand G4920 (PresActImpr):
007:015 There is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762 from without G1855 a man G0444, that G3739 entering G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 him G0846 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) defile G2840 (AorActInf) him G0846: but G0235 the things which come G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G0575 him G0846, those G1565 are they G2076 (PresInd) that defile G2840 (PresActPtc) the man G0444.
007:016 If any man G1536 have G2192 (PresActInd) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
007:017 And G2532 when G3753 he was entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3624 from G0575 the people G3793, his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 concerning G4012 the parable G3850.
007:018 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210 so G3779 without understanding G0801 also G2532? Do ye G3539 not G3756 perceive G3539 (PresActInd), that G3754 whatsoever thing G3956 from without G1855 entereth G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the man G0444, [it] cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) defile G2840 (AorActInf) him G0846;
007:019 Because G3754 it entereth G1531 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 into G1519 his G0846 heart G2588, but G0235 into G1519 the belly G2836, and G2532 goeth out G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) into G1519 the draught G0856, purging G2511 (PresActPtc) all G3956 meats G1033?
007:020 And G1161 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 That which cometh G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the man G0444, that G1565 defileth G2840 (PresActInd) the man G0444.
007:021 For G1063 from within G2081, out of G1537 the heart G2588 of men G0444, proceed G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) evil G2556 thoughts G1261, adulteries G3430, fornications G4202, murders G5408,
007:022 Thefts G2829, covetousness G4124, wickedness G4189, deceit G1388, lasciviousness G0766, an evil G4190 eye G3788, blasphemy G0988, pride G5243, foolishness G0877:
007:023 All G3956 these G5023 evil things G4190 come G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) from within G2081, and G2532 defile G2840 (PresActInd) the man G0444.
007:024 And G2532 from thence G1564 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the borders G3181 of Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, and G2532 entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 an house G3614, and would have G2309 (ImpfActInd) no man G3762 know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) [it]: but G2532 he could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 be hid G2990 (Aor2ActInf).
007:025 For G1063 a [certain] woman G1135, whose G3739 G0846 young daughter G2365 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) an unclean G0169 spirit G4151, heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of G4012 him G0846, and came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and fell G4363 (Aor2ActInd) at G4314 his G0846 feet G4228:
007:026  G1161 The woman G1135 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a Greek G1674, a Syrophenician G4949 by nation G1085; and G2532 she besought G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he would cast forth G1544 (PresActSubj) the devil G1140 out of G1537 her G0846 daughter G2364.
007:027 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) the children G5043 first G4412 be filled G5526 (AorPasInf): for G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 meet G2570 to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) the children’s G5043 bread G0740, and G2532 to cast G0906 (Aor2ActInf) [it] unto the dogs G2952.
007:028 And G1161 she answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yes G3483, Lord G2962: yet G2532 G1063 the dogs G2952 under G5270 the table G5132 eat G2068 (PresActInd) of G0575 the children’s G3813 crumbs G5589.
007:029 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, For G1223 this G5126 saying G3056 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr); the devil G1140 is gone G1831 (PerfActInd) out of G1537 thy G4675 daughter G2364.
007:030 And G2532 when she was come G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 her G0846 house G3624, she found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the devil G1140 gone out G1831 (PerfActPtc), and G2532 her daughter G2364 laid G0906 (PerfPasPtc) upon G1909 the bed G2825.
007:031 And G2532 again G3825, departing G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 the coasts G3725 of Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the sea G2281 of Galilee G1056, through G0303 the midst G3319 of the coasts G3725 of Decapolis G1179.
007:032 And G2532 they bring G5342 (PresActInd) unto him G0846 one that was deaf G2974, and had an impediment in his speech G3424; and G2532 they beseech G3870 (PresActInd) him G0846 to G2443 put G2007 (Aor2ActSubj) his hand G5495 upon him G0846.
007:033 And G2532 he took G0618 (Aor2MidPtc) him G0846 aside G2596 G2398 from G0575 the multitude G3793, and put G0906 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 fingers G1147 into G1519 his G0846 ears G3775, and G2532 he spit G4429 (AorActPtc), and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 tongue G1100;
007:034 And G2532 looking up G0308 (AorActPtc) to G1519 heaven G3772, he sighed G4727 (AorActInd), and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Ephphatha G2188, that is G3603, Be opened G1272 (AorPasImpr).
007:035 And G2532 straightway G2112 his G0846 ears G0189 were opened G1272 (AorPasInd), and G2532 the string G1199 of his G0846 tongue G1100 was loosed G3089 (AorPasInd), and G2532 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) plain G3723.
007:036 And G2532 he charged G1291 (AorMidInd) them G0846 that G2443 they should tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) no man G3367: but G1161 the more G3745 he G0846 charged G1291 (ImpfMidInd) them G0846, so much the more G3123 a great deal G4054 they published G2784 (ImpfActInd) [it];
007:037 And G2532 were beyond measure G5249 astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), He hath done G4160 (PerfActInd) all things G3956 well G2573: he maketh G4160 (PresActInd) both G2532 the deaf G2974 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), and G2532 the dumb G0216 to speak G2980 (PresActInf).
008:001 ¶ In G1722 those G1565 days G2250 the multitude G3793 being G5607 (PresPtc) very great G3827, and G2532 having G2192 (PresActPtc) nothing G3361 G5101 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj), Jesus G2424 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) his G0846 disciples G3101 [unto him], and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846,
008:002 I have compassion G4697 (PresMidPasDepInd) on G1909 the multitude G3793, because G3754 they have G4357 now G2235 been G4357 (PresActInd) with me G3427 three G5140 days G2250, and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) nothing G3756 G5101 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj):
008:003 And G2532 if G1437 I send G0630 them G0846 away G0630 (AorActSubj) fasting G3523 to G1519 their own G0846 houses G3624, they will faint G1590 (FutPasInd) by G1722 the way G3598: for G1063 divers G5100 of them G0846 came G2240 (PerfActInd) from far G3113.
008:004 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, From whence G4159 can G1410 (FutMidDepInd) a man G5100 satisfy G5526 (AorActInf) these G5128 [men] with bread G0740 here G5602 in G1909 the wilderness G2047?
008:005 And G2532 he asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) them G0846, How many G4214 loaves G0740 have ye G2192 (PresActInd)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Seven G2033.
008:006 And G2532 he commanded G3853 (AorActInd) the people G3793 to sit down G0377 (Aor2ActInf) on G1909 the ground G1093: and G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the seven G2033 loaves G0740, and gave thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), and brake G2806 (AorActInd), and G2532 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) to his G0846 disciples G3101 to G2443 set before G3908 (Aor2ActSubj) [them]; and G2532 they did set [them] before G3908 (AorActInd) the people G3793.
008:007 And G2532 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) a few G3641 small fishes G2485: and G2532 he blessed G2127 (AorActPtc), and commanded G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to set G3908 them G0846 also G2532 before G3908 (Aor2ActInf) [them].
008:008 So G1161 they did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd): and G2532 they took up G0142 (AorActInd) of the broken G2801 [meat] that was left G4051 seven G2033 baskets G4711.
008:009 And G1161 they that had eaten G5315 (Aor2ActPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5613 four thousand G5070: and G2532 he sent G0630 them G0846 away G0630 (AorActInd).
008:010 And G2532 straightway G2112 he entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143 with G3326 his G0846 disciples G3101, and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the parts G3313 of Dalmanutha G1148.
008:011 And G2532 the Pharisees G5330 came forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to question G4802 (PresActInf) with him G0846, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) of G3844 him G0846 a sign G4592 from G0575 heaven G3772, tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
008:012 And G2532 he sighed deeply G0389 (AorActPtc) in his G0846 spirit G4151, and saith G3004 (PresActInd), Why G5101 doth G1934 this G3778 generation G1074 seek after G1934 (PresActInd) a sign G4592? verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, There shall no G1487 sign G4592 be given G1325 (FutPasInd) unto this G5026 generation G1074.
008:013 And G2532 he left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and entering G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ship G4143 again G3825 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 the other side G4008.
008:014 Now G2532 [the disciples] had forgotten G1950 (Aor2MidDepInd) to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) bread G0740, neither G2532 G3756 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) they in G1722 the ship G4143 with G3326 them G1438 more than G1508 one G1520 loaf G0740.
008:015 And G2532 he charged G1291 (ImpfMidInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Take heed G3708 (PresActImpr), beware G0991 (PresActImpr) of G0575 the leaven G2219 of the Pharisees G5330, and G2532 [of] the leaven G2219 of Herod G2264.
008:016 And G2532 they reasoned G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G4314 themselves G0240, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [It is] because G3754 we have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 bread G0740.
008:017 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 reason ye G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd), because G3754 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 bread G0740? perceive ye G3539 (PresActInd) not yet G3768, neither G3761 understand G4920 (PresActInd)? have ye G2192 (PresActInd) your G5216 heart G2588 yet G2089 hardened G4456 (PerfPasPtc)?
008:018 Having G2192 (PresActPtc) eyes G3788, see ye G0991 (PresActInd) not G3756? and G2532 having G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775, hear ye G0191 (PresActInd) not G3756? and G2532 do ye G3421 not G3756 remember G3421 (PresActInd)?
008:019 When G3753 I brake G2806 (AorActInd) the five G4002 loaves G0740 among G1519 five thousand G4000, how many G4214 baskets G2894 full G4134 of fragments G2801 took ye up G0142 (AorActInd)? They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Twelve G1427.
008:020 And G1161 when G3753 the seven G2033 among G1519 four thousand G5070, how many G4214 baskets G4711 full G4138 of fragments G2801 took ye up G0142 (AorActInd)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Seven G2033.
008:021 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, How G4459 is it that ye do G4920 not G3756 understand G4920 (PresActInd)?
008:022 And G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Bethsaida G0966; and G2532 they bring G5342 (PresActInd) a blind man G5185 unto him G0846, and G2532 besought G3870 (PresActInd) him G0846 to G2443 touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) him G0846.
008:023 And G2532 he took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) the blind man G5185 by the hand G5495, and led G1806 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out of G1854 the town G2968; and G2532 when he had spit G4429 (AorActPtc) on G1519 his G0846 eyes G3659, and put G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) his hands G5495 upon him G0846, he asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 if G1536 he saw G0991 (PresActInd) ought G1536.
008:024 And G2532 he looked up G0308 (AorActPtc), and said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 I see G0991 (PresActInd) men G0444 as G5613 G3708 (PresActInd) trees G1186, walking G4043 (PresActPtc).
008:025 After G1534 that he put G2007 (AorActInd) [his] hands G5495 again G3825 upon G1909 his G0846 eyes G3788, and G2532 made G4160 (AorActInd) him G0846 look up G0308 (AorActInf): and G2532 he was restored G0600 (AorPasInd), and G2532 saw G1689 (AorActInd) every man G0537 clearly G5081.
008:026 And G2532 he sent G0649 him G0846 away G0649 (AorActInd) to G1519 his G0846 house G3624, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Neither G3366 go G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 the town G2968, nor G3366 tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) [it] to any G5100 in G1722 the town G2968.
008:027 And G2532 Jesus G2424 went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101, into G1519 the towns G2968 of Caesarea G2542 Philippi G5376: and G2532 by G1722 the way G3598 he asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Whom G5101 do G3004 men G0444 say G3004 (PresActInd) that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)?
008:028 And G1161 they answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), John G2491 the Baptist G0910: but G1161 some G0243 [say], Elias G2243; and G2532 others G0243, One G1520 of the prophets G4396.
008:029 And G2532 he G0846 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, But G1161 whom G5101 say G3004 (PresActInd) ye G5210 that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)? And G1161 Peter G4074 answereth G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the Christ G5547.
008:030 And G2532 he charged G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846 that G2443 they should tell G3004 (PresActSubj) no man G3367 of G4012 him G0846.
008:031 And G2532 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to teach G1321 (PresActInf) them G0846, that G3754 the Son G5207 of man G0444 must G1163 (PresInd) suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf) many things G4183, and G2532 be rejected G0593 (AorPasInf) of G0575 the elders G4245, and G2532 [of] the chief priests G0749, and G2532 scribes G1122, and G2532 be killed G0615 (AorPasInf), and G2532 after G3326 three G5140 days G2250 rise again G0450 (Aor2ActInf).
008:032 And G2532 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) that saying G3056 openly G3954. And G2532 Peter G4074 took G4355 (Aor2MidPtc) him G0846, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to rebuke G2008 (PresActInf) him G0846.
008:033 But G1161 when he had turned about G1994 (Aor2PasPtc) and G2532 looked G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) on his G0846 disciples G3101, he rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) Peter G4074, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Get thee G5217 (PresActImpr) behind G3694 me G3450, Satan G4567: for G3754 thou savourest G5426 (PresActInd) not G3756 the things that be of God G2316, but G0235 the things that be of men G0444.
008:034 And G2532 when he had called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) the people G3793 [unto him] with G4862 his G0846 disciples G3101 also, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Whosoever G3748 will G2309 (PresActInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) after G3694 me G3450, let him deny G0533 (AorMidDepImpr) himself G1438, and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) his G0846 cross G4716, and G2532 follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
008:035 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 will G2309 (PresActSubj) save G4982 (AorActInf) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846; but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 life G5590 for G1752 my sake G1700 and G2532 the gospel’s G2098, the same G3778 shall save G4982 (FutActInd) it G0846.
008:036 For G1063 what G5101 shall it profit G5623 (FutActInd) a man G0444, if G1437 he shall gain G2770 (AorActSubj) the whole G3650 world G2889, and G2532 lose G2210 (AorPasSubj) his own G0846 soul G5590?
008:037 Or G2228 what G5101 shall G1325 a man G0444 give G1325 (FutActInd) in exchange G0465 for his G0846 soul G5590?
008:038 Whosoever G3739 G0302 therefore G1063 shall be ashamed G1870 (AorPasDepSubj) of me G3165 and G2532 of my G1699 words G3056 in G1722 this G5026 adulterous G3428 and G2532 sinful G0268 generation G1074; of him G0846 also G2532 shall G1870 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be ashamed G1870 (FutPasDepInd), when G3752 he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 the glory G1391 of his G0846 Father G3962 with G3326 the holy G0040 angels G0032.
009:001 ¶ And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 there be G1526 (PresInd) some G5100 of them that stand G2476 (PerfActPtc) here G5602, which G3748 shall G1089 not G3364 taste G1089 (AorMidDepSubj) of death G2288, till G2193 G0302 they have seen G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 come G2064 (Perf2ActPtc) with G1722 power G1411.
009:002 And G2532 after G3326 six G1803 days G2250 Jesus G2424 taketh G3880 (PresActInd) [with him] Peter G4074, and G2532 James G2385, and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 leadeth G0399 them G0846 up G0399 (PresActInd) into G1519 an high G5308 mountain G3735 apart G2596 G2398 by themselves G3441: and G2532 he was transfigured G3339 (AorPasInd) before G1715 them G0846.
009:003 And G2532 his G0846 raiment G2440 became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) shining G4744 (PresActPtc), exceeding G3029 white G3022 as G5613 snow G5510; so as G3634 no G3756 fuller G1102 on G1909 earth G1093 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) white G3021 (AorActInf) them.
009:004 And G2532 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846 Elias G2243 with G4862 Moses G3475: and G2532 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) talking G4814 (PresActPtc) with Jesus G2424.
009:005 And G2532 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G3004 (PresActInd) to Jesus G2424, Master G4461, it is G2076 (PresInd) good G2570 for us G2248 to be G1511 (PresInf) here G5602: and G2532 let us make G4160 (AorActSubj) three G5140 tabernacles G4633; one G3391 for thee G4671, and G2532 one G3391 for Moses G3475, and G2532 one G3391 for Elias G2243.
009:006 For G1063 he wist G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 to say G2980 (AorActSubj); for G1063 they were sore G2258 (ImpfInd) afraid G1630.
009:007 And G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a cloud G3507 that overshadowed G1982 (PresActPtc) them G0846: and G2532 a voice G5456 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the cloud G3507, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207: hear G0191 (PresActImpr) him G0846.
009:008 And G2532 suddenly G1819, when they had looked round about G4017 (AorMidPtc), they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) no man G3762 any more G3765, save G0235 Jesus G2424 only G3441 with G3326 themselves G1438.
009:009 And G1161 as they G0846 came down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G0575 the mountain G3735, he charged G1291 (AorMidInd) them G0846 that G2443 they should tell G1334 (AorMidDepSubj) no man G3367 what things G3739 they had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd), till G1508 G3752 the Son G5207 of man G0444 were risen G0450 (Aor2ActSubj) from G1537 the dead G3498.
009:010 And G2532 they kept G2902 (AorActInd) that saying G3056 with G4314 themselves G1438, questioning one with another G4802 (PresActPtc) what G5101 the rising G0450 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498 should mean G2076 (PresInd).
009:011 And G2532 they asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Why G3754 say G3004 (PresActInd) the scribes G1122 that G3754 Elias G2243 must G1163 (PresInd) first G4412 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf)?
009:012 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846, Elias G2243 verily G3303 cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) first G4412, and restoreth G0600 (PresActInd) all things G3956; and G2532 how G4459 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) of G1909 the Son G5207 of man G0444, that G2443 he must suffer G3958 (Aor2ActSubj) many things G4183, and G2532 be set at nought G1847 (AorPasSubj).
009:013 But G0235 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 Elias G2243 is G2064 indeed G2532 come G2064 (Perf2ActInd), and G2532 they have done G4160 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 whatsoever G3745 they listed G2309 (AorActInd), as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) of G1909 him G0846.
009:014 And G2532 when he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 [his] disciples G3101, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a great G4183 multitude G3793 about G4012 them G0846, and G2532 the scribes G1122 questioning G4802 (PresActPtc) with them G0846.
009:015 And G2532 straightway G2112 all G3956 the people G3793, when they beheld G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, were greatly amazed G1568 (AorPasInd), and G2532 running to G4370 (PresActPtc) [him] saluted G0782 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846.
009:016 And G2532 he asked G1905 (AorActInd) the scribes G1122, What G5101 question ye G4802 (PresActInd) with G4314 them G0846?
009:017 And G2532 one G1520 of G1537 the multitude G3793 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Master G1320, I have brought G5342 (AorActInd) unto G4314 thee G4571 my G3450 son G5207, which hath G2192 (PresActPtc) a dumb G0216 spirit G4151;
009:018 And G2532 wheresoever G3699 G0302 he taketh G2638 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846, he teareth G4486 (PresActInd) him G0846: and G2532 he foameth G0875 (PresActInd), and G2532 gnasheth G5149 (PresActInd) with his G0846 teeth G3599, and G2532 pineth away G3583 (PresPasInd): and G2532 I spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to thy G4675 disciples G3101 that G2443 they should cast G1544 him G0846 out G1544 (Aor2ActSubj); and G2532 they could G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756.
009:019 He answereth G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) him G0846, and G1161 saith G3004 (PresActInd), O G5599 faithless G0571 generation G1074, how long G2193 G4219 shall I be G2071 (FutInd) with G4314 you G5209? how long G2193 G4219 shall I suffer G0430 (FutMidDepInd) you G5216? bring G5342 (PresActImpr) him G0846 unto G4314 me G3165.
009:020 And G2532 they brought G5342 (AorActInd) him G0846 unto G4314 him G0846: and G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, straightway G2112 the spirit G4151 tare G4682 (AorActInd) him G0846; and G2532 he fell G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) on G1909 the ground G1093, and wallowed G2947 (ImpfMidPasInd) foaming G0875 (PresActPtc).
009:021 And G2532 he asked G1905 (AorActInd) his G0846 father G3962, How long G4214 is it G2076 (PresInd) ago G5550 since G5613 this G5124 came G1096 (Perf2ActInd) unto him G0846? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Of a child G3812.
009:022 And G2532 ofttimes G4178 it hath cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 into G2532 G1519 the fire G4442, and G2532 into G1519 the waters G5204, to G2443 destroy G0622 (AorActSubj) him G0846: but G0235 if G1536 thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) do any thing G1536, have compassion G4697 (AorPasDepPtc) on G1909 us G2248, and help G0997 (AorActImpr) us G2254.
009:023  G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) believe G4100 (AorActInf), all things G3956 [are] possible G1415 to him G0846 that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc).
009:024 And G2532 straightway G2112 the father G3962 of the child G3813 cried out G2896 (AorActPtc), and said G3004 (ImpfActInd) with G3326 tears G1144, Lord G2962, I believe G4100 (PresActInd); help thou G0997 (PresActImpr) mine G3450 unbelief G0570.
009:025 When G1161 Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 the people G3793 came running together G1998 (PresActInd), he rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the foul G0169 spirit G4151, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, [Thou] dumb G0216 and G2532 deaf G2974 spirit G4151, I G1473 charge G2004 (PresActInd) thee G4671, come G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 him G0846, and G2532 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) no more G3371 into G1519 him G0846.
009:026 And G2532 [the spirit] cried G2896 (AorActPtc), and G2532 rent G4682 (AorActPtc) him G0846 sore G4183, and came out of him G1831 (Aor2ActInd): and G2532 he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5616 one dead G3498; insomuch G5620 that G3754 many G4183 said G3004 (PresActInf), He is dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
009:027 But G1161 Jesus G2424 took G2902 (AorActPtc) him G0846 by the hand G5495, and lifted G1453 him G0846 up G1453 (AorActInd); and G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActInd).
009:028 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the house G3624, his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 privately G2596 G2398, Why G3754 could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 we G2249 cast G1544 him G0846 out G1544 (Aor2ActInf)?
009:029 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, This G5124 kind G1085 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come forth G1831 (Aor2ActInf) by G1722 nothing G3762, but G1508 by G1722 prayer G4335 and G2532 fasting G3521.
009:030 And G2532 they departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) thence G1564, and passed G3899 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) through G1223 Galilee G1056; and G2532 he would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 that G2443 any man G5100 should know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) [it].
009:031 For G1063 he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 The Son G5207 of man G0444 is delivered G3860 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the hands G5495 of men G0444, and G2532 they shall kill G0615 (FutActInd) him G0846; and G2532 after that he is killed G0615 (AorPasPtc), he shall rise G0450 (FutMidInd) the third G5154 day G2250.
009:032 But G1161 they understood not G0050 (ImpfActInd) that saying G4487, and G2532 were afraid G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to ask G1905 (AorActInf) him G0846.
009:033 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Capernaum G2584: and G2532 being G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 the house G3614 he asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) them G0846, What G5101 was it that ye disputed G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G4314 yourselves G1438 by G1722 the way G3598?
009:034 But G1161 they held their peace G4623 (ImpfActInd): for G1063 by G1722 the way G3598 they had disputed G1256 (AorPasDepInd) among G4314 themselves G0240, who G5101 [should be] the greatest G3187.
009:035 And G2532 he sat down G2523 (AorActPtc), and called G5455 (AorActInd) the twelve G1427, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, If any man G1536 desire G2309 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) first G4413, [the same] shall be G2071 (FutInd) last G2078 of all G3956, and G2532 servant G1249 of all G3956.
009:036 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a child G3813, and set G2476 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the midst G3319 of them G0846: and G2532 when he had taken G1723 him G0846 in his arms G1723 (AorMidDepPtc), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846,
009:037 Whosoever G3739 G1437 shall receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) one G1520 of such G5108 children G3813 in G1909 my G3450 name G3686, receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G1691: and G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 shall receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) me G1691, receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 me G1691, but G0235 him that sent G0649 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
009:038 And G1161 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, we saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) one G5100 casting out G1544 (PresActPtc) devils G1140 in thy G4675 name G3686, and G3739 he followeth G0190 (PresActInd) not G3756 us G2254: and G2532 we forbad G2967 (AorActInd) him G0846, because G3754 he followeth G0190 (PresActInd) not G3756 us G2254.
009:039 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) him G0846 not G3361: for G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) no man G3762 which G3739 shall do G4160 (FutActInd) a miracle G1411 in G1909 my G3450 name G3686, that G2532 can G1410 (FutMidDepInd) lightly G5035 speak evil G2551 (AorActInf) of me G3165.
009:040 For G1063 he that G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 against G2596 us G2257 is G2076 (PresInd) on G5228 our G2257 part G5228.
009:041 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall give G4222 you G5209 a cup G4221 of water G5204 to drink G4222 (AorActSubj) in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, because G3754 ye belong G2075 (PresInd) to Christ G5547, verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, he shall G0622 not G3364 lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 reward G3408.
009:042 And G2532 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall offend G4624 (AorActSubj) one G1520 of [these] little ones G3398 that believe G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 me G1691, it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 G3123 for him G0846 that G1487 a millstone G3037 G3457 were hanged G4029 (PresMidPasDepInd) about G4012 his G0846 neck G5137, and G2532 he were cast G0906 (PerfPasInd) into G1519 the sea G2281.
009:043 And G2532 if G1437 thy G4675 hand G5495 offend G4624 (PresActSubj) thee G4571, cut G0609 it G0846 off G0609 (AorActImpr): it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 for thee G4671 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 life G2222 maimed G2948, than G2228 having G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 hands G5495 to go G0565 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 hell G1067, into G1519 the fire G4442 that never shall be quenched G0762:
009:044 Where G3699 their G0846 worm G4663 dieth G5053 (PresActInd) not G3756, and G2532 the fire G4442 is G4570 not G3756 quenched G4570 (PresPasInd).
009:045 And G2532 if G1437 thy G4675 foot G4228 offend G4624 (PresActSubj) thee G4571, cut G0609 it G0846 off G0609 (AorActImpr): it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 for thee G4671 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) halt G5560 into G1519 life G2222, than G2228 having G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 feet G4228 to be cast G0906 (AorPasInf) into G1519 hell G1067, into G1519 the fire G4442 that never shall be quenched G0762:
009:046 Where G3699 their G0846 worm G4663 dieth G5053 (PresActInd) not G3756, and G2532 the fire G4442 is G4570 not G3756 quenched G4570 (PresPasInd).
009:047 And G2532 if G1437 thine G4675 eye G3788 offend G4624 (PresActSubj) thee G4571, pluck G1544 it G0846 out G1544 (Aor2ActImpr): it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 for thee G4671 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 with one eye G3442, than G2228 having G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 eyes G3788 to be cast G0906 (AorPasInf) into G1519 hell G1067 fire G4442:
009:048 Where G3699 their G0846 worm G4663 dieth G5053 (PresActInd) not G3756, and G2532 the fire G4442 is G4570 not G3756 quenched G4570 (PresPasInd).
009:049 For G1063 every one G3956 shall be salted G0233 (FutPasInd) with fire G4442, and G2532 every G3956 sacrifice G2378 shall be salted G0233 (FutPasInd) with salt G0251.
009:050 Salt G0217 [is] good G2570: but G1161 if G1437 the salt G0217 have lost G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) his saltness G0358, wherewith G1722 G5101 will ye season G0741 (FutActInd) it G0846? Have G2192 (PresActImpr) salt G0217 in G1722 yourselves G1438, and G2532 have peace G1514 (PresActImpr) one G0240 with G1722 another G0240.
010:001 ¶ And G2547 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) from thence G2547, and cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) into G1519 the coasts G3725 of Judaea G2449 by G1223 the farther side G4008 of Jordan G2446: and G2532 the people G3793 resort G4848 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846 again G3825; and G2532, as G5613 he was wont G1486 (PlupfActInd), he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 again G3825.
010:002 And G2532 the Pharisees G5330 came to him G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, Is it G1487 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for a man G0435 to put away G0630 (AorActInf) [his] wife G1135? tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
010:003 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 did Moses G3475 command G1781 (AorMidDepInd) you G5213?
010:004 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Moses G3475 suffered G2010 (AorActInd) to write G1125 (AorActInf) a bill G0975 of divorcement G0647, and G2532 to put [her] away G0630 (AorActInf).
010:005 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, For G4314 the hardness G4641 of your G5216 heart G4641 he wrote G1125 (AorActInd) you G5213 this G5026 precept G1785.
010:006 But G1161 from G0575 the beginning G0746 of the creation G2937 God G2316 made G4160 (AorActInd) them G0846 male G0730 and G2532 female G2338.
010:007 For this cause G1752 G5127 shall G2641 a man G0444 leave G2641 (FutActInd) his G0846 father G3962 and G2532 mother G3384, and G2532 cleave G4347 (FutPasInd) to G4314 his G0846 wife G1135;
010:008 And G2532 they twain G1417 shall be G2071 (FutInd) one G1519 G3391 flesh G4561: so then G5620 they are G1526 (PresInd) no more G3765 twain G1417, but G0235 one G3391 flesh G4561.
010:009 What G3739 therefore G3767 God G2316 hath joined together G4801 (AorActInd), let G5563 not G3361 man G0444 put asunder G5563 (PresActImpr).
010:010 And G2532 in G1722 the house G3614 his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846 again G3825 of G4012 the same G0846 [matter].
010:011 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Whosoever G3739 G1437 shall put away G0630 (AorActSubj) his G0846 wife G1135, and G2532 marry G1060 (AorActSubj) another G0243, committeth adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInd) against G1909 her G0846.
010:012 And G2532 if G1437 a woman G1135 shall put away G0630 (AorActSubj) her G0846 husband G0435, and G2532 be married G1060 (AorPasSubj) to another G0243, she committeth adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInd).
010:013 And G2532 they brought G4374 (ImpfActInd) young children G3813 to him G0846, that G2443 he should touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) them G0846: and G1161 [his] disciples G3101 rebuked G2008 (ImpfActInd) those that brought G4374 (PresActPtc) [them].
010:014 But G1161 when Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he was much displeased G0023 (AorActInd), and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Suffer G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) the little children G3813 to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto G4314 me G3165, and G2532 forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) them G0846 not G3361: for G1063 of such G5108 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
010:015 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Whosoever G3739 shall G1209 not G3362 receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 as G5613 a little child G3813, he shall G1525 not G3364 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) therein G1519 G0846.
010:016 And G2532 he took G1723 them G0846 up in his arms G1723 (AorMidDepPtc), put G5087 (PresActPtc) [his] hands G5495 upon G1909 them G0846, and blessed G2127 (ImpfActInd) them G0846.
010:017 And G2532 when he was gone forth G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the way G0846 G3598, there came G4370 one G1520 running G4370 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 kneeled G1120 (AorActPtc) to him G0846, and asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, Good G0018 Master G1320, what G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj) that G2443 I may inherit G2816 (AorActSubj) eternal G0166 life G2222?
010:018 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Why G5101 callest thou G3004 (PresActInd) me G3165 good G0018? [there is] none G3762 good G0018 but G1508 one G1520, [that is], God G2316.
010:019 Thou knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) the commandments G1785, Do G3431 not G3361 commit adultery G3431 (AorActSubj), Do G5407 not G3361 kill G5407 (AorActSubj), Do G2813 not G3361 steal G2813 (AorActSubj), Do G5576 not G3361 bear false witness G5576 (AorActSubj), Defraud G0650 (AorActSubj) not G3361, Honour G5091 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 father G3962 and G2532 mother G3384.
010:020 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, all G3956 these G5023 have I observed G5442 (AorMidInd) from G1537 my G3450 youth G3503.
010:021 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 beholding G1689 (AorActPtc) him G0846 loved G0025 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, One thing G1520 thou G4671 lackest G5302 (PresActInd): go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr), sell G4453 (AorActImpr) whatsoever G3745 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd), and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) to the poor G4434, and G2532 thou shalt have G2192 (FutActInd) treasure G2344 in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 come G1204 (Impr), take up G0142 (AorActPtc) the cross G4716, and follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
010:022 And G1161 he was sad G4768 (AorActPtc) at G1909 that saying G3056, and went away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) grieved G3076 (PresPasPtc): for G1063 he had G2192 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) great G4183 possessions G2933.
010:023 And G2532 Jesus G2424 looked round about G4017 (AorMidPtc), and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101, How G4459 hardly G1423 shall they that have G2192 (PresActPtc) riches G5536 enter G1525 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316!
010:024 And G1161 the disciples G3101 were astonished G2284 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 words G3056. But G1161 Jesus G2424 answereth G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) again G3825, and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Children G5043, how G4459 hard G1422 is it G2076 (PresInd) for them that trust G3982 (Perf2ActPtc) in G1909 riches G5536 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316!
010:025 It is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123 for a camel G2574 to go G1525 (Aor2ActInf) G1330 (Aor2ActInf) through G1223 the eye G5168 of a needle G4476, than G2228 for a rich man G4145 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
010:026 And G1161 they were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) out of measure G4057, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) among G4314 themselves G1438, G2532 Who G5101 then can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be saved G4982 (AorPasInf)?
010:027 And G1161 Jesus G2424 looking upon G1689 (AorActPtc) them G0846 saith G3004 (PresActInd), With G3844 men G0444 [it is] impossible G0102, but G0235 not G3756 with G3844 God G2316: for G1063 with G3844 God G2316 all things G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) possible G1415.
010:028 Then G2532 Peter G4074 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto him G0846, Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we G2249 have left G0863 (AorActInd) all G3956, and G2532 have followed G0190 (AorActInd) thee G4671.
010:029 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, There is G2076 (PresInd) no man G3762 that G3739 hath left G0863 (AorActInd) house G3614, or G2228 brethren G0080, or G2228 sisters G0079, or G2228 father G3962, or G2228 mother G3384, or G2228 wife G1135, or G2228 children G5043, or G2228 lands G0068, for my G1700 sake G1752, and G2532 the gospel’s G2098,
010:030 But G3362 he shall receive G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) an hundredfold G1542 now G3568 in G1722 this G5129 time G2540, houses G3614, and G2532 brethren G0080, and G2532 sisters G0079, and G2532 mothers G3384, and G2532 children G5043, and G2532 lands G0068, with G3326 persecutions G1375; and G2532 in G1722 the world G0165 to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) eternal G0166 life G2222.
010:031 But G1161 many G4183 [that are] first G4413 shall be G2071 (FutInd) last G2078; and G2532 the last G2078 first G4413.
010:032 And G1161 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the way G3598 going up G0305 (PresActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414; and G2532 Jesus G2424 went G2258 (ImpfInd) before G4254 (PresActPtc) them G0846: and G2532 they were amazed G2284 (ImpfPasInd); and G2532 as they followed G0190 (PresActPtc), they were afraid G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd). And G2532 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) again G3825 the twelve G1427, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to tell G3004 (PresActInf) them G0846 what things should G3195 (PresActPtc) happen G4819 (PresActInf) unto him G0846,
010:033 [Saying], G3754 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we go up G0305 (PresActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414; and G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall be delivered G3860 (FutPasInd) unto the chief priests G0749, and G2532 unto the scribes G1122; and G2532 they shall condemn G2632 (FutActInd) him G0846 to death G2288, and G2532 shall deliver G3860 (FutActInd) him G0846 to the Gentiles G1484:
010:034 And G2532 they shall mock G1702 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 shall scourge G3146 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 shall spit upon G1716 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 shall kill G0615 (FutActInd) him G0846: and G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 he shall rise again G0450 (FutMidInd).
010:035 And G2532 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491, the sons G5207 of Zebedee G2199, come G4365 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, we would G2309 (PresActInd) that G2443 thou shouldest do G4160 (AorActSubj) for us G2254 whatsoever G3739 G1437 we shall desire G0154 (AorActSubj).
010:036 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 would G2309 (PresActInd) ye that I G3165 should do G4160 (AorActInf) for you G5213?
010:037  G1161 They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Grant G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) unto us G2254 that G2443 we may sit G2523 (AorActSubj), one G1520 on G1537 thy G4675 right hand G1188, and G2532 the other G1520 on G1537 thy G4675 left hand G2176, in G1722 thy G4675 glory G1391.
010:038 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 ye ask G0154 (PresMidInd): can ye G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) of the cup G4221 that G3739 I G1473 drink of G4095 (PresActInd)? and G2532 be baptized G0907 (PresPasInd) with the baptism G0908 that G3739 I G1473 am baptized with G0907 (AorPasInf)?
010:039 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, We can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd). And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye shall G4095 indeed G3303 drink G4095 (PresActInd) of the cup G4221 that G3739 I G1473 drink of G4095 (FutMidDepInd); and G2532 with the baptism G0908 that G3739 I G1473 am baptized withal G0907 (PresPasInd) shall ye be baptized G0907 (FutPasInd):
010:040 But G1161 to sit G2523 (AorActInf) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188 and G2532 on G1537 my G3450 left hand G2176 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 mine G1699 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf); but G0235 [it shall be given to them] for whom G3739 it is prepared G2090 (PerfPasInd).
010:041 And G2532 when the ten G1176 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be much displeased G0023 (PresActInf) with G4012 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491.
010:042 But G1161 Jesus G2424 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846 [to him], and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 they which are accounted G1380 (PresActPtc) to rule G0757 (PresActInf) over the Gentiles G1484 exercise lordship G2634 (PresActInd) over them G0846; and G2532 their G0846 great ones G3173 exercise authority G2715 (PresActInd) upon them G0846.
010:043 But G1161 so G3779 shall it G2071 not G3756 be G2071 (FutInd) among G1722 you G5213: but G0235 whosoever G3739 G1437 will G2309 (PresActSubj) be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) great G3173 among G1722 you G5213, shall be G2071 (FutInd) your G5216 minister G1249:
010:044 And G2532 whosoever G3739 G0302 of you G5216 will G2309 (PresActSubj) be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) the chiefest G4413, shall be G2071 (FutInd) servant G1401 of all G3956.
010:045 For G1063 even G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 to be ministered unto G1247 (AorPasInf), but G0235 to minister G1247 (AorActInf), and G2532 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) his G0846 life G5590 a ransom G3083 for G0473 many G4183.
010:046 And G2532 they came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Jericho G2410: and G2532 as he G0846 went G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G0575 Jericho G2410 with G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 and G2532 a great G2425 number of people G3793, blind G5185 Bartimaeus G0924, the son G5207 of Timaeus G5090, sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) by G3844 the highway side G3598 begging G4319 (PresActPtc).
010:047 And G2532 when he heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480, he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to cry out G2896 (PresActInf), and G2532 say G3004 (PresActInf), Jesus G2424, [thou] Son G5207 of David G1138, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165.
010:048 And G2532 many G4183 charged G2008 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he should hold his peace G4623 (AorActSubj): but G1161 he cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) the more G3123 a great deal G4183, [Thou] Son G5207 of David G1138, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165.
010:049 And G2532 Jesus G2424 stood still G2476 (Aor2ActPtc), and commanded G2036 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to be called G5455 (AorPasInf). And G2532 they call G5455 (PresActInd) the blind man G5185, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Be of good comfort G2293 (PresActImpr), rise G1453 (AorMidImpr); he calleth G5455 (PresActInd) thee G4571.
010:050 And G1161 he, casting away G0577 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 garment G2440, rose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 Jesus G2424.
010:051 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, What G5101 wilt G2309 (PresActInd) thou that I should do G4160 (AorActSubj) unto thee G4671? G1161 The blind man G5185 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G4462, that G2443 I might receive my sight G0308 (AorActSubj).
010:052 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr); thy G4675 faith G4102 hath made G4982 thee G4571 whole G4982 (PerfActInd). And G2532 immediately G2112 he received his sight G0308 (AorActInd), and G2532 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424 in G1722 the way G3598.
011:001 ¶ And G2532 when G3753 they came nigh G1448 (PresActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, unto G1519 Bethphage G0967 and G2532 Bethany G0963, at G4314 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636, he sendeth forth G0649 (PresActInd) two G1417 of his G0846 disciples G3101,
011:002 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Go your way G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 the village G2968 over against G2713 you G5216: and G2532 as soon as G2112 ye be entered G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 it G0846, ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd) a colt G4454 tied G1210 (PerfPasPtc), whereon G1909 G3739 never G3762 man G0444 sat G2523 (PerfActInd); loose G3089 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and bring G0071 (Aor2ActImpr) [him].
011:003 And G2532 if G1437 any man G5100 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto you G5213, Why G5101 do ye G4160 (PresActInd) this G5124? say ye G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) that G3754 the Lord G2962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 of him G0846; and G2532 straightway G2112 he will send G0649 (FutActInd) him G0846 hither G5602.
011:004 And G1161 they went their way G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the colt G4454 tied G1210 (PerfPasPtc) by G4314 the door G2374 without G1854 in G1909 a place where two ways met G0296; and G2532 they loose G3089 (PresActInd) him G0846.
011:005 And G2532 certain of them G5100 that stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) there G1563 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 do ye G4160 (PresActInd), loosing G3089 (PresActPtc) the colt G4454?
011:006 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846 even as G2531 Jesus G2424 had commanded G1781 (AorMidDepInd): and G2532 they let G0863 them G0846 go G0863 (AorActInd).
011:007 And G2532 they brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) the colt G4454 to G4314 Jesus G2424, and G2532 cast G1911 their G0846 garments G2440 on G1911 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846; and G2532 he sat G2523 (AorActInd) upon G1909 him G0846.
011:008 And G1161 many G4183 spread G4766 (AorActInd) their G0846 garments G2440 in G1519 the way G3598: and G1161 others G0243 cut down G2875 (ImpfActInd) branches G4746 off G1537 the trees G1186, and G2532 strawed G4766 (ImpfActInd) [them] in G1519 the way G3598.
011:009 And G2532 they that went before G4254 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they that followed G0190 (PresActPtc), cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hosanna G5614; Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962:
011:010 Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [be] the kingdom G0932 of our G2257 father G3962 David G1138, that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962: Hosanna G5614 in G1722 the highest G5310.
011:011 And G2532 Jesus G2424 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 into G1519 the temple G2411: and G2532 when he had looked round about upon G4017 (AorMidPtc) all things G3956, and now G2235 the eventide G3798 G5610 was come G5607 (PresPtc), he went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 Bethany G0963 with G3326 the twelve G1427.
011:012 And G2532 on the morrow G1887, when they G0846 were come G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Bethany G0963, he was hungry G3983 (AorActInd):
011:013 And G2532 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) a fig tree G4808 afar off G3113 having G2192 (PresActPtc) leaves G5444, he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), if G1487 haply G0686 he might find G2147 (FutActInd) any thing G5100 thereon G1722 G0846: and G2532 when he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1909 it G0846, he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) nothing G3762 but G1508 leaves G5444; for G1063 the time G2540 of figs G4810 was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 [yet].
011:014 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto it G0846, No man G3367 eat G5315 (Aor2ActOpt) fruit G2590 of G1537 thee G4675 hereafter G3371 for G1519 ever G0165. And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) [it].
011:015 And G2532 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414: and G2532 Jesus G2424 went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the temple G2411, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to cast out G1544 (PresActInf) them that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) and G2532 bought G0059 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 overthrew G2690 (AorActInd) the tables G5132 of the moneychangers G2855, and G2532 the seats G2515 of them G0846 that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) doves G4058;
011:016 And G2532 would G0863 not G3756 suffer G0863 (ImpfActInd) that G2443 any man G5100 should carry G1308 (Aor2ActSubj) [any] vessel G4632 through G1223 the temple G2411.
011:017 And G2532 he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Is it G1125 not G3756 written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 My G3450 house G3624 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) of all G3956 nations G1484 the house G3624 of prayer G4335? but G1161 ye G5210 have made G4160 (AorActInd) it G0846 a den G4693 of thieves G3027.
011:018 And G2532 the scribes G1122 and G2532 chief priests G0749 heard G0191 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) how G4459 they might destroy G0622 (FutActInd) him G0846: for G1063 they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846, because G3754 all G3956 the people G3793 was astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 doctrine G1322.
011:019 And G2532 when G3753 even G3796 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), he went G1607 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) out of G1854 the city G4172.
011:020 And G2532 in the morning G4404, as they passed by G3899 (PresMidPasDepPtc), they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the fig tree G4808 dried up G3583 (PerfPasPtc) from G1537 the roots G4491.
011:021 And G2532 Peter G4074 calling to remembrance G0363 (AorPasDepPtc) saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G4461, behold G2396, the fig tree G4808 which G3739 thou cursedst G2672 (AorMidDepInd) is withered away G3583 (PerfPasInd).
011:022 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Have G2192 (PresActImpr) faith G4102 in God G2316.
011:023 For G1063 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto this G5129 mountain G3735, Be thou removed G0142 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 be thou cast G0906 (AorPasImpr) into G1519 the sea G2281; and G2532 shall G1252 not G3361 doubt G1252 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588, but G0235 shall believe G4100 (AorActSubj) that G3754 those things which G3739 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) shall come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd); he G0846 shall have G2071 (FutInd) whatsoever G3739 G1437 he saith G2036 (Aor2ActSubj).
011:024 Therefore G1223 G5124 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, What G3745 things G3956 soever G0302 ye desire G0154 (PresMidInd), when ye pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), believe G4100 (PresActImpr) that G3754 ye receive G2983 (PresActInd) [them], and G2532 ye G5213 shall have G2071 (FutInd) [them].
011:025 And G2532 when G3752 ye stand G4739 (PresActSubj) praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), forgive G0863 (PresActImpr), if G1536 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) ought G1536 against G2596 any G5100: that G2443 your G5216 Father G3962 also G2532 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772 may forgive G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5213 your G5216 trespasses G3900.
011:026 But G1161 if G1487 ye G5210 do G0863 not G3756 forgive G0863 (PresActInd), neither G3761 will G0863 your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772 forgive G0863 (FutActInd) your G5216 trespasses G3900.
011:027 And G2532 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) again G3825 to G1519 Jerusalem G2414: and G2532 as he G0846 was walking G4043 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, there come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 him G0846 the chief priests G0749, and G2532 the scribes G1122, and G2532 the elders G4245,
011:028 And G2532 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, By G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 doest thou G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023? and G2532 who G5101 gave G1325 (AorActInd) thee G4671 this G5026 authority G1849 to G2443 do G4160 (PresActSubj) these things G5023?
011:029 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I will G1905 also G2504 ask G1905 (FutActInd) of you G5209 one G1520 question G3056, and G2532 answer G0611 (AorPasDepImpr) me G3427, and G2532 I will tell G2046 (FutActInd) you G5213 by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 I do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
011:030 The baptism G0908 of John G2491, was G2258 (ImpfInd) [it] from G1537 heaven G3772, or G2228 of G1537 men G0444? answer G0611 (AorPasDepImpr) me G3427.
011:031 And G2532 they reasoned G3049 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G4314 themselves G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1437 we shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), From G1537 heaven G3772; he will say G2046 (FutActInd), Why G1302 then G3767 did ye G4100 not G3756 believe G4100 (AorActInd) him G0846?
011:032 But G0235 if G1437 we shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Of G1537 men G0444; they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the people G2992: for G1063 all G0537 [men] counted G2192 (ImpfActInd) John G2491, that G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) a prophet G4396 indeed G3689.
011:033 And G2532 they answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G3004 (PresActInd) unto Jesus G2424, We G1492 cannot G3756 tell G1492 (PerfActInd). And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Neither G3761 do I G1473 tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 I do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
012:001 ¶ And G2532 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak G3004 (PresActInf) unto them G0846 by G1722 parables G3850. A [certain] man G0444 planted G5452 (AorActInd) a vineyard G0290, and G2532 set G4060 (AorActInd) an hedge about G5418 [it], and G2532 digged G3736 (AorActInd) [a place for] the winefat G5276, and G2532 built G3618 (AorActInd) a tower G4444, and G2532 let G1554 it G0846 out G1554 (Aor2MidInd) to husbandmen G1092, and G2532 went into a far country G0589 (AorActInd).
012:002 And G2532 at the season G2540 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) to G4314 the husbandmen G1092 a servant G1401, that G2443 he might receive G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) from G3844 the husbandmen G1092 of G0575 the fruit G2590 of the vineyard G0290.
012:003 And G1161 they caught G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) [him], and beat G1194 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 sent [him] away G0649 (AorActInd) empty G2756.
012:004 And G2532 again G3825 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 another G0243 servant G1401; and at him G2548 they cast stones G3036 (AorActPtc), and wounded [him] in the head G2775 (AorActInd), and G2532 sent [him] away G0649 (AorActInd) shamefully handled G0821 (PerfPasPtc).
012:005 And G2532 again G3825 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) another G0243; and him G2548 they killed G0615 (AorActInd), and G2532 many G4183 others G0243; G3303 beating some G1194 (PresActPtc), and G1161 killing some G0615 (PresActPtc).
012:006 Having G2192 (PresActPtc) yet G2089 therefore G3767 one G1520 son G5207, his G0846 wellbeloved G0027, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) him G0846 also G2532 last G2078 unto G4314 them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 They will reverence G1788 (Fut2PasInd) my G3450 son G5207.
012:007 But G1161 those G1565 husbandmen G1092 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) among G4314 themselves G1438, This G3754 G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the heir G2818; come G1205 (Impr), let us kill G0615 (PresActSubj) him G0846, and G2532 the inheritance G2817 shall be G2071 (FutInd) ours G2257.
012:008 And G2532 they took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and killed G0615 (AorActInd) [him], and G2532 cast G1544 (Aor2ActInd) [him] out of G1854 the vineyard G0290.
012:009 What G5101 shall G4160 therefore G3767 the lord G2962 of the vineyard G0290 do G4160 (FutActInd)? he will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) and G2532 destroy G0622 (FutActInd) the husbandmen G1092, and G2532 will give G1325 (FutActInd) the vineyard G0290 unto others G0243.
012:010 And have ye G0314 not G3761 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) this G5026 scripture G1124; The stone G3037 which G3739 the builders G3618 (PresActPtc) rejected G0593 (AorActInd) is G3778 G1096 (AorPasDepInd) become G1519 the head G2776 of the corner G1137:
012:011 This G3778 was G1096 the Lord’s G2962 doing G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G3844, and G2532 it is G2076 (PresInd) marvellous G2298 in G1722 our G2257 eyes G3788?
012:012 And G2532 they sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to lay hold G2902 (AorActInf) on him G0846, but G2532 feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) the people G3793: for G1063 they knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the parable G3850 against G4314 them G0846: and G2532 they left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and went their way G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
012:013 And G2532 they send G0649 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846 certain G5100 of the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 of the Herodians G2265, to G2443 catch G0064 (AorActSubj) him G0846 in [his] words G3056.
012:014 And G1161 when they were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), they say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) true G0227, and G2532 G4671 carest G3756 G3199 (PresActInd) for G4012 no man G3762: for G1063 thou regardest G0991 (PresActInd) not G3756 the person G1519 G4383 of men G0444, but G0235 teachest G1321 (PresActInd) the way G3598 of God G2316 in G1909 truth G0225: Is it lawful G1832 (PresInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) tribute G2778 to Caesar G2541, or G2228 not G3756?
012:015 Shall we give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj), or G2228 shall we not G3361 give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj)? But G1161 he, knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) their G0846 hypocrisy G5272, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 tempt ye G3985 (PresActInd) me G3165? bring G5342 (PresActImpr) me G3427 a penny G1220, that G2443 I may see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) [it].
012:016 And G1161 they brought G5342 (AorActInd) [it]. And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Whose G5101 [is] this G3778 image G1504 and G2532 superscription G1923? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Caesar’s G2541.
012:017 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Render G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) to Caesar G2541 the things that are G3588 Caesar’s G2541, and G2532 to God G2316 the things that are G3588 God’s G2316. And G2532 they marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) at G1909 him G0846.
012:018 Then G2532 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846 the Sadducees G4523, which G3748 say G3004 (PresActInd) there is G1511 (PresInf) no G3361 resurrection G0386; and G2532 they asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
012:019 Master G1320, Moses G3475 wrote G1125 (AorActInd) unto us G2254, If G3754 G1437 a man’s G5100 brother G0080 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), and G2532 leave G2641 (Aor2ActSubj) [his] wife G1135 [behind him], and G2532 leave G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) no G3361 children G5043, that G2443 his G0846 brother G0080 should take G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) his G0846 wife G1135, and G2532 raise up G1817 (AorActSubj) seed G4690 unto his G0846 brother G0080.
012:020 Now there were G2258 (ImpfInd) seven G2033 brethren G0080: and G2532 the first G4413 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) a wife G1135, and G2532 dying G0599 (PresActPtc) left G0863 (AorActInd) no G3756 seed G4690.
012:021 And G2532 the second G1208 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846, and G2532 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd), G2532 neither G3761 left G0863 (AorActInd) he G0846 any seed G4690: and G2532 the third G5154 likewise G5615.
012:022 And G2532 the seven G2033 had G2983 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846, and G2532 left G0863 (AorActInd) no G3756 seed G4690: last G2078 of all G3956 the woman G1135 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532.
012:023 In G1722 the resurrection G0386 therefore G3767, when G3752 they shall rise G0450 (Aor2ActSubj), whose G5101 wife G1135 shall she be G2071 (FutInd) of them G0846? for G1063 the seven G2033 had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 to wife G1135.
012:024 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Do ye G4105 not G3756 therefore G1223 G5124 err G4105 (PresPasInd), because ye know G1492 (PerfActPtc) not G3361 the scriptures G1124, neither G3366 the power G1411 of God G2316?
012:025 For G1063 when G3752 they shall rise G0450 (Aor2ActSubj) from G1537 the dead G3498, they neither G3777 marry G1060 (PresActInd), nor G3777 are given in marriage G1061 (PresPasInd); but G0235 are G1526 (PresInd) as G5613 the angels G0032 which G3588 are in G1722 heaven G3772.
012:026 And G1161 as touching G4012 the dead G3498, that G3754 they rise G1453 (PresPasInd): have ye G0314 not G3756 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of Moses G3475, how G5613 in G1909 the bush G0942 God G2316 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 [am] the God G2316 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 the God G2316 of Isaac G2464, and G2532 the God G2316 of Jacob G2384?
012:027 He is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 the God G2316 of the dead G3498, but G0235 the God G2316 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc): ye G5210 therefore G3767 do G4105 greatly G4183 err G4105 (PresPasInd).
012:028 And G2532 one G1520 of the scribes G1122 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and having heard G0191 (AorActPtc) them G0846 reasoning together G4802 (PresActPtc), and perceiving G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 he had answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 well G2573, asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, Which G4169 is G2076 (PresInd) the first G4413 commandment G1785 of all G3956?
012:029 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, The G3754 first G4413 of all G3956 the commandments G1785 [is], Hear G0191 (PresActImpr), O Israel G2474; The Lord G2962 our G2257 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) one G1520 Lord G2962:
012:030 And G2532 thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 heart G2588, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 soul G5590, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 mind G1271, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 strength G2479: this G3778 [is] the first G4413 commandment G1785.
012:031 And G2532 the second G1208 [is] like G3664, [namely] this G3778 G0846, Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) thy G4675 neighbour G4139 as G5613 thyself G4572. There is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 other G0243 commandment G1785 greater G3187 than these G5130.
012:032 And G2532 the scribe G1122 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Well G2573, Master G1320, thou hast said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the G1909 truth G0225: for G3754 there is G2076 (PresInd) one G1520 God G2316; and G2532 there is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 other G0243 but G4133 he G0846:
012:033 And G2532 to love G0025 (PresActInf) him G0846 with G1537 all G3650 the heart G2588, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 the understanding G4907, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 the soul G5590, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 the strength G2479, and G2532 to love G0025 (PresActInf) [his] neighbour G4139 as G5613 himself G1438, is G2076 (PresInd) more G4119 than all G3956 whole burnt offerings G3646 and G2532 sacrifices G2378.
012:034 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he G0846 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) discreetly G3562, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou art G1488 (PresInd) not G3756 far G3112 from G0575 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316. And G2532 no man G3762 after that G3765 durst G5111 (ImpfActInd) ask G1905 (AorActInf) him G0846 [any question].
012:035 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G3004 (ImpfActInd), while he taught G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, How G4459 say G3004 (PresActInd) the scribes G1122 that G3754 Christ G5547 is G2076 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of David G1138?
012:036 For G1063 David G1138 himself G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) by G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, The LORD G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to my G3450 Lord G2962, Sit thou G2521 (PresMidPasDepImpr) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188, till G2193 G0302 I make G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) thine G4675 enemies G2190 thy G4675 footstool G5286 G4228.
012:037 David G1138 therefore G3767 himself G0846 calleth G3004 (PresActInd) him G0846 Lord G2962; and G2532 whence G4159 is he G2076 (PresInd) [then] his G0846 son G5207? And G2532 the common G4183 people G3793 heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 gladly G2234.
012:038 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 in G1722 his G0846 doctrine G1322, Beware G0991 (PresActImpr) of G0575 the scribes G1122, which G3588 love G2309 (PresActPtc) to go G4043 (PresActInf) in G1722 long clothing G4749, and G2532 [love] salutations G0783 in G1722 the marketplaces G0058,
012:039 And G2532 the chief seats G4410 in G1722 the synagogues G4864, and G2532 the uppermost rooms G4411 at G1722 feasts G1173:
012:040 Which devour G2719 (PresActPtc) widows G5503 ’ houses G3614, and G2532 for a pretence G4392 make G4336 long G3117 prayers G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc): these G3778 shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) greater G4055 damnation G2917.
012:041 And G2532 Jesus G2424 sat G2523 (AorActPtc) over against G2713 the treasury G1049, and beheld G2334 (ImpfActInd) how G4459 the people G3793 cast G0906 (PresActInd) money G5475 into G1519 the treasury G1049: and G2532 many G4183 that were rich G4145 cast in G0906 (ImpfActInd) much G4183.
012:042 And G2532 there came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) a certain G3391 poor G4434 widow G5503, and she threw in G0906 (Aor2ActInd) two G1417 mites G3016, which make G3603 a farthing G2835.
012:043 And G2532 he called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) [unto him] his G0846 disciples G3101, and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 this G3778 poor G4434 widow G5503 hath cast G0906 more G4119 in G0906 (PerfActInd), than all G3956 they which have cast G0906 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the treasury G1049:
012:044 For G1063 all G3956 [they] did cast in G0906 (Aor2ActInd) of G1537 their G0846 abundance G4052 (PresActPtc); but G1161 she G3778 G0846 of G1537 her G0846 want G5304 did cast in G0906 (Aor2ActInd) all G3956 that G3745 she had G2192 (ImpfActInd), [even] all G3650 her G0846 living G0979.
013:001 ¶ And G2532 as he G0846 went G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the temple G2411, one G1520 of his G0846 disciples G3101 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, see G2396 what manner G4217 of stones G3037 and G2532 what G4217 buildings G3619 [are here]!
013:002 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Seest thou G0991 (PresActInd) these G5025 great G3173 buildings G3619? there shall G0863 not G3364 be left G0863 (AorPasSubj) one stone G3037 upon G1909 another G3037, that G3739 shall G2647 not G3364 be thrown down G2647 (AorPasSubj).
013:003 And G2532 as he G0846 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1519 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636 over against G2713 the temple G2411, Peter G4074 and G2532 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491 and G2532 Andrew G0406 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 privately G2596 G2398,
013:004 Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254, when G4219 shall these things G5023 be G2071 (FutInd)? and G2532 what G5101 [shall be] the sign G4592 when G3752 all G3956 these things G5023 shall G3195 (PresActSubj) be fulfilled G4931 (PresPasInf)?
013:005 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) them G0846 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf), Take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) lest G3361 any G5100 [man] deceive G4105 (AorActSubj) you G5209:
013:006 For G1063 many G4183 shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) in G1909 my G3450 name G3686, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [Christ]; and G2532 shall deceive G4105 (FutActInd) many G4183.
013:007 And G1161 when G3752 ye shall hear G0191 (AorActSubj) of wars G4171 and G2532 rumours G0189 of wars G4171, be ye G2360 not G3361 troubled G2360 (PresPasImpr): for G1063 [such things] must G1163 (PresInd) needs be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf); but G0235 the end G5056 [shall] not [be] yet G3768.
013:008 For G1063 nation G1484 shall rise G1453 (FutPasInd) against G1909 nation G1484, and G2532 kingdom G0932 against G1909 kingdom G0932: and G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) earthquakes G4578 in divers G2596 places G5117, and G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) famines G3042 and G2532 troubles G5016: these G5023 [are] the beginnings G0746 of sorrows G5604.
013:009 But G1161 take heed G5210 G0991 (PresActImpr) to yourselves G1438: for G1063 they shall deliver G3860 you G5209 up G3860 (FutActInd) to G1519 councils G4892; and G2532 in G1519 the synagogues G4864 ye shall be beaten G1194 (Fut2PasInd): and G2532 ye shall be brought G2476 (FutPasInd) G0071 (FutPasInd) before G1909 rulers G2232 and G2532 kings G0935 for my G1700 sake G1752, for G1519 a testimony G3142 against them G0846.
013:010 And G2532 the gospel G2098 must G1163 (PresInd) first G4412 be published G2784 (AorPasInf) among G1519 all G3956 nations G1484.
013:011 But G1161 when G3752 they shall lead G0071 (Aor2ActSubj) [you], and deliver G3860 you G5209 up G3860 (PresActPtc), take G4305 no G3361 thought beforehand G4305 (PresActImpr) what G5101 ye shall speak G2980 (AorActSubj), neither G3366 do ye premeditate G3191 (PresActImpr): but G0235 whatsoever G3739 shall be G1437 given G1325 (AorPasSubj) you G5213 in G1722 that G1565 hour G5610, that G5124 speak G2980 (PresActImpr) ye: for G1063 it is G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 ye G5210 that speak G2980 (PresActPtc), but G0235 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
013:012 Now G1161 the brother G0080 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) the brother G0080 to G1519 death G2288, and G2532 the father G3962 the son G5043; and G2532 children G5043 shall rise up G1881 (FutMidDepInd) against G1909 [their] parents G1118, and G2532 shall cause G2289 them G0846 to be put to death G2289 (FutActInd).
013:013 And G2532 ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) hated G3404 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956 [men] for G1223 my G3450 name’s sake G1223 G3686: but G1161 he that shall endure G5278 (AorActPtc) unto G1519 the end G5056, the same G3778 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
013:014 But G1161 when G3752 ye shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the abomination G0946 of desolation G2050, spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) of by G5259 Daniel G1158 the prophet G4396, standing G2476 (Perf2ActPtc) G2476 (PerfActPtc) where G3699 it ought G1163 (PresInd) not G3756, (let him that readeth G0314 (PresActPtc) understand G3539 (PresActImpr),) then G5119 let them G5343 that be in G1722 Judaea G2449 flee G5343 (PresActImpr) to G1519 the mountains G3735:
013:015 And G1161 let him G2597 that is on G1909 the housetop G1430 not G3361 go down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the house G3614, neither G3366 enter G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) [therein], to take G0142 (AorActInf) any thing G5100 out of G1537 his G0846 house G3614:
013:016 And G2532 let G1994 him that is G5607 (PresPtc) in G1519 the field G0068 not G3361 turn G1519 G1994 back G3694 again G1994 (AorActImpr) for to take up G0142 (AorActInf) his G0846 garment G2440.
013:017 But G1161 woe G3759 to them that are G2192 (PresActPtc) with G1722 child G1064, and G2532 to them that give suck G2337 (PresActPtc) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250!
013:018 And G1161 pray ye G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) that G3363 your G5216 flight G5437 be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) not G3363 in the winter G5494.
013:019 For G1063 [in] those G1565 days G2250 shall be G2071 (FutInd) affliction G2347, such G5108 as G3634 was G1096 (Perf2ActInd) not G3756 from G0575 the beginning G0746 of the creation G2937 which G3739 God G2316 created G2936 (AorActInd) unto G2193 this time G3568, neither G2532 G3364 shall be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
013:020 And G2532 except G1508 that the Lord G2962 had shortened G2856 (AorActInd) those days G2250, no G3756 G3956 flesh G4561 should be G0302 saved G4982 (AorPasInd): but G0235 for G1223 the elect’s sake G1588, whom G3739 he hath chosen G1586 (AorMidInd), he hath shortened G2856 (AorActInd) the days G2250.
013:021 And G2532 then G5119 if G1437 any man G5100 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) to you G5213, Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), here G5602 [is] Christ G5547; or G2228, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [he is] there G1563; believe G4100 (AorActSubj) [him] not G3361:
013:022 For G1063 false Christs G5580 and G2532 false prophets G5578 shall rise G1453 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall shew G1325 (FutActInd) signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059, to G4314 seduce G0635 (PresActInf), if G1487 [it were] possible G1415, even G2532 the elect G1588.
013:023 But G1161 take G0991 ye G5210 heed G0991 (PresActImpr): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I have foretold G4280 (PerfActInd) you G5213 all things G3956.
013:024 But G0235 in G1722 those G1565 days G2250, after G3326 that G1565 tribulation G2347, the sun G2246 shall be darkened G4654 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the moon G4582 shall G1325 not G3756 give G1325 (FutActInd) her G0846 light G5338,
013:025 And G2532 the stars G0792 of heaven G3772 shall G2071 (FutInd) fall G1601 (PresActPtc), and G2532 the powers G1411 that are in G1722 heaven G3772 shall be shaken G4531 (FutPasInd).
013:026 And G2532 then G5119 shall they see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the clouds G3507 with G3326 great G4183 power G1411 and G2532 glory G1391.
013:027 And G2532 then G5119 shall he send G0649 (FutActInd) his G0846 angels G0032, and G2532 shall gather together G1996 (FutActInd) his G0846 elect G1588 from G1537 the four G5064 winds G0417, from G0575 the uttermost part G0206 of the earth G1093 to G2193 the uttermost part G0206 of heaven G3772.
013:028 Now G1161 learn G3129 (Aor2ActImpr) a parable G3850 of G0575 the fig tree G4808; When G3752 her G0846 branch G2798 is G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) yet G2235 tender G0527, and G2532 putteth forth G1631 (PresActSubj) leaves G5444, ye know G1097 (PresActInd) that G3754 summer G2330 is G2076 (PresInd) near G1451:
013:029 So G3779 ye G5210 in like manner G2532, when G3752 ye shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) these things G5023 come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc), know G1097 (PresActImpr) that G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) nigh G1451, [even] at G1909 the doors G2374.
013:030 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 this G3778 generation G1074 shall G3928 not G3364 pass G3928 (Aor2ActSubj), till G3360 G3739 all G3956 these things G5023 be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
013:031 Heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093 shall pass away G3928 (FutMidDepInd): but G1161 my G3450 words G3056 shall G3928 not G3364 pass away G3928 (Aor2ActSubj).
013:032 But G1161 of G4012 that G1565 day G2250 and G2532 [that] hour G5610 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) no man G3762, no, not G3761 the angels G0032 which G3588 are in G1722 heaven G3772, neither G3761 the Son G5207, but G1508 the Father G3962.
013:033 Take ye heed G0991 (PresActImpr), watch G0069 (PresActImpr) and G2532 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr): for G1063 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 when G4219 the time G2540 is G2076 (PresInd).
013:034 [For the Son of man is] as G5613 a man G0444 taking a far journey G0590, who left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 house G3614, and G2532 gave G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) authority G1849 to his G0846 servants G1401, and G2532 to every man G1538 his G0846 work G2041, and G2532 commanded G1781 (AorMidDepInd) the porter G2377 to G2443 watch G1127 (PresActSubj).
013:035 Watch ye G1127 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767: for G1063 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 when G4219 the master G2962 of the house G3614 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), at even G3796, or G2228 at midnight G3317, or G2228 at the cockcrowing G0219, or G2228 in the morning G4404:
013:036 Lest G3361 coming G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) suddenly G1810 he find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5209 sleeping G2518 (PresActPtc).
013:037 And G1161 what G3739 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto all G3956, Watch G1127 (PresActImpr).
014:001 ¶ After G1161 two G1417 days G2250 was G2258 (ImpfInd) [the feast of] the passover G3957, and G2532 of G3326 unleavened bread G0106: and G2532 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) how G4459 they might take G2902 (AorActPtc) him G0846 by G1722 craft G1388, and put [him] to death G0615 (PresActSubj).
014:002 But G1161 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Not G3361 on G1722 the feast G1859 [day], lest G3379 there be G2071 (FutInd) an uproar G2351 of the people G2992.
014:003 And G2532 being G0846 G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 Bethany G0963 in G1722 the house G3614 of Simon G4613 the leper G3015, as he G0846 sat at meat G2621 (PresMidPasDepPtc), there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a woman G1135 having G2192 (PresActPtc) an alabaster box G0211 of ointment G3464 of spikenard G3487 G4101 very precious G4185; and G2532 she brake G4937 (AorActPtc) the box G0211, and poured G2708 (AorActInd) [it] on G2596 his G0846 head G2776.
014:004 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) some G5100 that had indignation G0023 (PresActPtc) within G4314 themselves G1438, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActPtc), Why G1519 G5101 was G1096 this G3778 waste G0684 of the ointment G3464 made G1096 (Perf2ActInd)?
014:005 For G1063 it G5124 might G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) have been sold G4097 (AorPasInf) for more than G1883 three hundred G5145 pence G1220, and G2532 have been given G1325 (AorPasInf) to the poor G4434. And G2532 they murmured against G1690 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) her G0846.
014:006 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Let G0863 her G0846 alone G0863 (Aor2ActImpr); why G5101 trouble ye G2873 G3930 (PresActInd) her G0846? she hath wrought G2038 (AorMidDepInd) a good G2570 work G2041 on G1519 me G1691.
014:007 For G1063 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) the poor G4434 with G3326 you G1438 always G3842, and G2532 whensoever G3752 ye will G2309 (PresActSubj) ye may G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) do G4160 (AorActInf) them G0846 good G2095: but G1161 me G1691 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 always G3842.
014:008 She hath done G4160 (AorActInd) what G3739 she G3778 G0846 could G2192 (ImpfActInd): she is come aforehand G4301 (Aor2ActInd) to anoint G3462 (AorActInf) my G3450 body G4983 to G1519 the burying G1780.
014:009 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Wheresoever G3699 G0302 this G5124 gospel G2098 shall be preached G2784 (AorPasSubj) throughout G1519 the whole G3650 world G2889, [this] also G2532 that G3739 she G3778 G0846 hath done G4160 (AorActInd) shall be spoken G2980 (FutPasInd) of for G1519 a memorial G3422 of her G0846.
014:010 And G2532 Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, one G1520 of the twelve G1427, went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the chief priests G0749, to G2443 betray G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846 unto them G0846.
014:011 And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they were glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd), and G2532 promised G1861 (AorMidPasDepInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 money G0694. And G2532 he sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) how G4459 he might conveniently G2122 betray G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846.
014:012 And G2532 the first G4413 day G2250 of unleavened bread G0106, when G3753 they killed G2380 (ImpfActInd) the passover G3957, his G0846 disciples G3101 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Where G4226 wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) that we go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and prepare G2090 (AorActSubj) that G2443 thou mayest eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the passover G3957?
014:013 And G2532 he sendeth forth G0649 (PresActInd) two G1417 of his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Go ye G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 the city G4172, and G2532 there shall meet G0528 (FutActInd) you G5213 a man G0444 bearing G0941 (PresActPtc) a pitcher G2765 of water G5204: follow G0190 (AorActImpr) him G0846.
014:014 And G2532 wheresoever G3699 G1437 he shall go in G1525 (Aor2ActSubj), say ye G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) to the goodman of the house G3617, G3754 The Master G1320 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) the guestchamber G2646, where G3699 I shall eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the passover G3957 with G3326 my G3450 disciples G3101?
014:015 And G2532 he G0846 will shew G1166 (FutActInd) you G5213 a large G3173 upper room G0508 furnished G4766 (PerfPasPtc) [and] prepared G2092: there G1563 make ready G2090 (AorActImpr) for us G2254.
014:016 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the city G4172, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) as G2531 he had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846: and G2532 they made ready G2090 (AorActInd) the passover G3957.
014:017 And G2532 in G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) the evening G3798 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) with G3326 the twelve G1427.
014:018 And G2532 as they G0846 sat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 did eat G2068 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 One G1520 of G1537 you G5216 which G3588 eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) with G3326 me G1700 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) me G3165.
014:019 And G1161 they began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be sorrowful G3076 (PresPasInf), and to G2532 say G3004 (PresActInf) unto him G0846 one by one G1527, G3385 [Is] it I G1473? and G2532 another G0243 [said, G3385 Is] it I G1473?
014:020 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, [It is] one G1520 of G1537 the twelve G1427, that dippeth G1686 (PresMidPtc) with G3326 me G1700 in G1519 the dish G5165.
014:021 The Son G5207 of man G0444 indeed G3303 goeth G5217 (PresActInd), as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) of G4012 him G0846: but G1161 woe G3759 to that G1565 man G0444 by G1223 whom G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd)! good G2570 were it G2258 (ImpfInd) for that G1565 man G0444 if G1487 he G0846 had G1080 never G3756 been born G1080 (AorPasInd).
014:022 And G2532 as they G0846 did eat G2068 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) bread G0740, and blessed G2127 (AorActPtc), and brake G2806 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) to them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr), eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr): this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 body G4983.
014:023 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the cup G4221, and when he had given thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), he gave G1325 (AorActInd) [it] to them G0846: and G2532 they all G3956 drank G4095 (Aor2ActInd) of G1537 it G0846.
014:024 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, This G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 blood G0129 of the new G2537 testament G1242, which G3588 is shed G1632 (PresPasPtc) for G4012 many G4183.
014:025 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, I will G3364 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) no more G3754 G3765 of G1537 the fruit G1081 of the vine G0288, until G2193 that G1565 day G2250 that G3752 I drink G4095 (PresActSubj) it G0846 new G2537 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
014:026 And G2532 when they had sung an hymn G5214 (AorActPtc), they went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636.
014:027 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 All ye G3956 shall be offended G4624 (FutPasInd) because of G1722 me G1722 G1698 this G5026 night G3571: for G3754 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), I will smite G3960 (FutActInd) the shepherd G4166, and G2532 the sheep G4263 shall be scattered G1287 (FutPasInd).
014:028 But G0235 after G3326 that I G3165 am risen G1453 (AorPasInf), I will go before G4254 (FutActInd) you G5209 into G1519 Galilee G1056.
014:029 But G1161 Peter G4074 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Although G2532 G1487 all G3956 shall be offended G4624 (FutPasInd), yet G0235 [will] not G3756 I G1473.
014:030 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, That G3754 this day G4594, [even] in G1722 this G5026 night G3571, before G4250 G2228 the cock G0220 crow G5455 (AorActInf) twice G1364, thou shalt deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151.
014:031 But G1161 he spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) the more G3123 vehemently G1537 G4053, If G1437 I G3165 should G1163 (PresSubj) die with G4880 (Aor2ActInf) thee G4671, I will not G3364 deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) thee G4571 in any wise G3364. Likewise G5615 also G1161 G2532 said they G3004 (ImpfActInd) all G3956.
014:032 And G2532 they came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 a place G5564 which G3739 was named G3686 Gethsemane G1068: and G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) to his G0846 disciples G3101, Sit ye G2523 (AorActImpr) here G5602, while G2193 I shall pray G4336 (AorMidDepSubj).
014:033 And G2532 he taketh G3880 (PresActInd) with G3326 him G1438 Peter G4074 and G2532 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be sore amazed G1568 (PresPasInf), and G2532 to be very heavy G0085 (PresActInf);
014:034 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, My G3450 soul G5590 is G2076 (PresInd) exceeding sorrowful G4036 unto G2193 death G2288: tarry ye G3306 (AorActImpr) here G5602, and G2532 watch G1127 (PresActImpr).
014:035 And G2532 he went forward G4281 (Aor2ActPtc) a little G3397, and fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 the ground G1093, and G2532 prayed G4336 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) that G2443, if G1487 it were G2076 (PresInd) possible G1415, the hour G5610 might pass G3928 (Aor2ActSubj) from G0575 him G0846.
014:036 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Abba G0005, Father G3962, all things G3956 [are] possible G1415 unto thee G4671; take away G3911 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5124 cup G4221 from G0575 me G1700: nevertheless G0235 not G3756 what G5101 I G1473 will G2309 (PresActInd), but G0235 what G5101 thou G4771 wilt.
014:037 And G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) them G0846 sleeping G2518 (PresActPtc), and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto Peter G4074, Simon G4613, sleepest thou G2518 (PresActInd)? couldest G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756 thou watch G1127 (AorActInf) one G3391 hour G5610?
014:038 Watch ye G1127 (PresActImpr) and G2532 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr), lest G3363 ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 temptation G3986. The spirit G4151 truly G3303 [is] ready G4289, but G1161 the flesh G4561 [is] weak G0772.
014:039 And G2532 again G3825 he went away G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd), and spake G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) the same G0846 words G3056.
014:040 And G2532 when he returned G5290 (AorActPtc), he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 asleep G2518 (PresActPtc) again G3825, (for G1063 their G0846 eyes G3788 were G2258 (ImpfInd) heavy G0916 (PerfPasPtc),) neither G2532 G3756 wist they G1492 (PlupfActInd) what G5101 to answer G0611 (AorPasDepSubj) him G0846.
014:041 And G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) the third time G5154, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Sleep on G2518 (PresActInd) now G3063, and G2532 take [your] rest G0373 (PresMidInd/PresMidImpr): it is enough G0566 (PresActInd), the hour G5610 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd); behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the Son G5207 of man G0444 is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the hands G5495 of sinners G0268.
014:042 Rise up G1453 (PresMidPasImpr), let us go G0071 (PresActSubj); lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he that betrayeth G3860 (PresActPtc) me G3165 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd).
014:043 And G2532 immediately G2112, while he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), cometh G3854 (PresMidPasDepInd) Judas G2455, one G1520 G5607 (PresPtc) of the twelve G1427, and G2532 with G3326 him G0846 a great G4183 multitude G3793 with G3326 swords G3162 and G2532 staves G3586, from G3844 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 and G2532 the elders G4245.
014:044 And G1161 he that betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846 had given G1325 (PlupfActInd) them G0846 a token G4953, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Whomsoever G3739 G0302 I shall kiss G5368 (AorActSubj), that same G0846 is he G2076 (PresInd); take G2902 (AorActImpr) him G0846, and G2532 lead [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActImpr) safely G0806.
014:045 And G2532 as soon as he was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), he goeth G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) straightway G2112 to him G0846, and saith G3004 (PresActInd), Master G4461, master G4461; and G2532 kissed G2705 (AorActInd) him G0846.
014:046 And G1161 they laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) their G0846 hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846, and G2532 took G2902 (AorActInd) him G0846.
014:047 And G1161 one G5100 of them G1520 that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc) drew G4685 (AorMidPtc) a sword G3162, and smote G3817 (AorActInd) a servant G1401 of the high priest G0749, and G2532 cut off G0851 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 ear G5621.
014:048 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Are ye come out G1831 (Aor2ActInd), as G5613 against G1909 a thief G3027, with G3326 swords G3162 and G2532 [with] staves G3586 to take G4815 (Aor2ActInf) me G3165?
014:049 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) daily G2250 G2596 with G4314 you G5209 in G1722 the temple G2411 teaching G1321 (PresActPtc), and G2532 ye took G2902 (AorActInd) me G3165 not G3756: but G0235 the scriptures G1124 must G2443 be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj).
014:050 And G2532 they all G3956 forsook G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd).
014:051 And G2532 there followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 a G1520 certain G5100 young man G3495, having a linen cloth G4616 cast G4016 (PerfPasPtc) about G1909 [his] naked G1131 [body]; and G2532 the young men G3495 laid hold G2902 (PresActInd) on him G0846:
014:052 And G1161 he left G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) the linen cloth G4616, and fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 them G0846 naked G1131.
014:053 And G2532 they led G0520 Jesus G2424 away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 the high priest G0749: and G2532 with him G0846 were assembled G4905 (PresMidPasDepInd) all G3956 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the elders G4245 and G2532 the scribes G1122.
014:054 And G2532 Peter G4074 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846 afar G3113 off G0575, even G2193 into G2080 G1519 the palace G0833 of the high priest G0749: and G2532 he sat G2258 (ImpfInd) G4775 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G3326 the servants G5257, and G2532 warmed himself G2328 (PresMidPtc) at G4314 the fire G5457.
014:055 And G1161 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 all G3650 the council G4892 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) for witness G3141 against G2596 Jesus G2424 to G1519 put G2289 him G0846 to death G2289 (AorActInf); and G2532 found G2147 (ImpfActInd) none G3756.
014:056 For G1063 many G4183 bare false witness G5576 (ImpfActInd) against G2596 him G0846, but G2532 their witness G3141 agreed G2258 not G2470 G3756 together G2258 (ImpfInd).
014:057 And G2532 there arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) certain G5100, and bare false witness G5576 (ImpfActInd) against G2596 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
014:058  G3754 We G2249 heard G0191 (AorActInd) him G0846 say G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 I G1473 will destroy G2647 (FutActInd) this G5126 temple G3485 that is made with hands G5499, and G2532 within G1223 three G5140 days G2250 I will build G3618 (FutActInd) another G0243 made without hands G0886.
014:059 But G2532 neither G3761 so G3779 did G2470 their G0846 witness G3141 agree together G2258 (ImpfInd) G2470.
014:060 And G2532 the high priest G0749 stood up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) in G1519 the midst G3319, and asked G1905 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Answerest G3756 thou G0611 (PresMidPasDepInd) nothing G3762? what G5101 [is it which] these G3778 witness G2649 (PresActInd) against thee G4675?
014:061 But G1161 he held his peace G4623 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) nothing G3762. Again G3825 the high priest G0749 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of the Blessed G2128?
014:062 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd): and G2532 ye shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of power G1411, and G2532 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G3326 the clouds G3507 of heaven G3772.
014:063 Then G1161 the high priest G0749 rent G1284 (AorActPtc) his G0846 clothes G5509, and saith G3004 (PresActInd), What G5101 need G5532 we G2192 (PresActInd) any further G2089 witnesses G3144?
014:064 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) the blasphemy G0988: what G5101 think G5316 (PresMidPasInd) ye G5213? And G1161 they all G3956 condemned G2632 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be G1511 (PresInf) guilty G1777 of death G2288.
014:065 And G2532 some G5100 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to spit G1716 (PresActInf) on him G0846, and G2532 to cover G4028 (PresActInf) his G0846 face G4383, and G2532 to buffet G2852 (PresActInf) him G0846, and G2532 to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto him G0846, Prophesy G4395 (AorActImpr): and G2532 the servants G5257 did strike G0906 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 with the palms of their hands G4475.
014:066 And G2532 as Peter G4074 was G5607 (PresPtc) beneath G2736 in G1722 the palace G0833, there cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) one G3391 of the maids G3814 of the high priest G0749:
014:067 And G2532 when she saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074 warming himself G2328 (PresMidPtc), she looked G1689 (AorActPtc) upon him G0846, and said G3004 (PresActInd), And G2532 thou G4771 also G2532 wast G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3479.
014:068 But G1161 he denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756, neither G3761 understand I G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) what G5101 thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd). And G2532 he went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out G1854 into G1519 the porch G4259; and G2532 the cock G0220 crew G5455 (AorActInd).
014:069 And G2532 a maid G3814 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 again G3825, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) to them that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc), This G3754 G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) [one] of G1537 them G0846.
014:070 And G1161 he denied it G0720 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) again G3825. And G2532 a little G3397 after G3326, they that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc) said G3004 (ImpfActInd) again G3825 to Peter G4074, Surely G0230 thou art G1488 (PresInd) [one] of G1537 them G0846: for G2532 G1063 thou art G1488 (PresInd) a Galilaean G1057, and G2532 thy G4675 speech G2981 agreeth G3662 (PresActInd) [thereto].
014:071 But G1161 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to curse G0332 (PresActInf) and G2532 to swear G3660 (PresActInf), [saying], I know G3754 G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 this G5126 man G0444 of whom G3739 ye speak G3004 (PresActInd).
014:072 And G2532 the G1537 second time G1208 the cock G0220 crew G5455 (AorActInd). And G2532 Peter G4074 called to mind G0363 (AorPasInd) the word G4487 that G3739 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, G3754 Before G4250 the cock G0220 crow G5455 (AorActInf) twice G1364, thou shalt deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151. And G2532 when he thought thereon G1911 (Aor2ActPtc), he wept G2799 (ImpfActInd).
015:001 ¶ And G2532 straightway G2112 in G1909 the morning G4404 the chief priests G0749 held G4160 (AorActPtc) a consultation G4824 with G3326 the elders G4245 and G2532 scribes G1122 and G2532 the whole G3650 council G4892, and bound G1210 (AorActPtc) Jesus G2424, and carried [him] away G0667 (AorActInd), and G2532 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) [him] to Pilate G4091.
015:002 And G2532 Pilate G4091 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453? And G1161 he answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) [it].
015:003 And G2532 the chief priests G0749 accused G2723 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 of many things G4183: but G1161 he G0846 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) nothing G3762.
015:004 And G1161 Pilate G4091 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846 again G3825, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Answerest thou G0611 (PresMidPasDepInd) nothing G3756 G3762? behold G2396 how many things G4214 they witness G2649 (PresActInd) against thee G4675.
015:005 But G1161 Jesus G2424 yet G3765 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) nothing G3762; so G5620 that Pilate G4091 marvelled G2296 (PresActInf).
015:006 Now G1161 at G2596 [that] feast G1859 he released G0630 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 one G1520 prisoner G1198, whomsoever G3746 they desired G0154 (ImpfMidInd).
015:007 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) [one] named G3004 (PresPasPtc) Barabbas G0912, [which lay] bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) with G3326 them that had made insurrection with him G4955, who G3748 had committed G4160 (PlupfActInd) murder G5408 in G1722 the insurrection G4714.
015:008 And G2532 the multitude G3793 crying aloud G0310 (AorActPtc) began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to desire G0154 (PresMidInf) [him to do] as G2531 he had ever G0104 done G4160 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846.
015:009 But G1161 Pilate G4091 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Will ye G2309 (PresActInd) that I release G0630 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453?
015:010 For G1063 he knew G1097 (ImpfActInd) that G3754 the chief priests G0749 had delivered G3860 (PlupfActInd) him G0846 for G1223 envy G5355.
015:011 But G1161 the chief priests G0749 moved G0383 (AorActInd) the people G3793, that G2443 he should rather G3123 release G0630 (AorActSubj) Barabbas G0912 unto them G0846.
015:012 And G1161 Pilate G4091 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 unto them G0846, What G5101 will ye G2309 (PresActInd) then G3767 that I shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) [unto him] whom G3739 ye call G3004 (PresActInd) the King G0935 of the Jews G2453?
015:013 And G1161 they cried out G2896 (AorActInd) again G3825, Crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) him G0846.
015:014 Then G1161 Pilate G4091 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Why G1063, what G5101 evil G2556 hath he done G4160 (AorActInd)? And G1161 they cried out G2896 (AorActInd) the more exceedingly G4056, Crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) him G0846.
015:015 And G1161 [so] Pilate G4091, willing G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to content G2425 G4160 (AorActInf) the people G3793, released G0630 (AorActInd) Barabbas G0912 unto them G0846, and G2532 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, when he had scourged G5417 (AorActPtc) [him], to G2443 be crucified G4717 (AorPasSubj).
015:016 And G1161 the soldiers G4757 led G0520 him G0846 away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) into G2080 the hall G0833, called G3603 Praetorium G4232; and G2532 they call together G4779 (PresActInd) the whole G3650 band G4686.
015:017 And G2532 they clothed G1746 (PresActInd) him G0846 with purple G4209, and G2532 platted G4120 (AorActPtc) a crown G4735 of thorns G0174, and put it about G4060 (PresActInd) his G0846 [head],
015:018 And G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to salute G0782 (PresMidPasDepInf) him G0846, Hail G5463 (PresActImpr), King G0935 of the Jews G2453!
015:019 And G2532 they smote G5180 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 on the head G2776 with a reed G2563, and G2532 did spit G1716 (ImpfActInd) upon him G0846, and G2532 bowing G5087 (PresActPtc) [their] knees G1119 worshipped G4352 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
015:020 And G2532 when G3753 they had mocked G1702 (AorActInd) him G0846, they took off G1562 (AorActInd) the purple G4209 from him G0846, and G2532 put G1746 his own G2398 clothes G2440 on G1746 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 led G1806 him G0846 out G1806 (PresActInd) to G2443 crucify G4717 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
015:021 And G2532 they compel G0029 (PresActInd) one G5100 Simon G4613 a Cyrenian G2956, who passed by G3855 (PresActPtc), coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G0575 the country G0068, the father G3962 of Alexander G0223 and G2532 Rufus G4504, to G2443 bear G0142 (AorActSubj) his G0846 cross G4716.
015:022 And G2532 they bring G5342 (PresActInd) him G0846 unto G1909 the place G5117 Golgotha G1115, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd), being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc), The place G5117 of a skull G2898.
015:023 And G2532 they gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) wine G3631 mingled with myrrh G4669 (PerfPasPtc): but G1161 he received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) [it] not G3756.
015:024 And G2532 when they had crucified G4717 (AorActPtc) him G0846, they parted G1266 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 garments G2440, casting G0906 (PresActPtc) lots G2819 upon G1909 them G0846, what G5101 every man G5101 should take G0142 (AorActSubj).
015:025 And G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) the third G5154 hour G5610, and G2532 they crucified G4717 (AorActInd) him G0846.
015:026 And G2532 the superscription G1923 of his G0846 accusation G0156 was G2258 (ImpfInd) written over G1924 (PerfPasPtc), THE KING G0935 OF THE JEWS G2453.
015:027 And G2532 with G4862 him G0846 they crucify G4717 (PresActInd) two G1417 thieves G3027; the one G1520 on G1537 his right hand G1188, and G2532 the other G1520 on G1537 his G0846 left G2176.
015:028 And G2532 the scripture G1124 was fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInd), which G3588 saith G3004 (PresActPtc), And G2532 he was numbered G3049 (AorPasInd) with G3326 the transgressors G0459.
015:029 And G2532 they that passed by G3899 (PresMidPasDepPtc) railed G0987 (ImpfActInd) on him G0846, wagging G2795 (PresActPtc) their G0846 heads G2776, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Ah G3758, thou that destroyest G2647 (PresActPtc) the temple G3485, and G2532 buildest G3618 (PresActPtc) [it] in G1722 three G5140 days G2250,
015:030 Save G4982 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572, and G2532 come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 the cross G4716.
015:031 Likewise G1161 G3668 also G2532 the chief priests G0749 mocking G1702 (PresActPtc) said G3004 (ImpfActInd) among G4314 themselves G0240 with G3326 the scribes G1122, He saved G4982 (AorActInd) others G0243; himself G1438 he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) save G4982 (AorActInf).
015:032 Let G2597 Christ G5547 the King G0935 of Israel G2474 descend G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) now G3568 from G0575 the cross G4716, that G2443 we may see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) and G2532 believe G4100 (AorActSubj). And G2532 they that were crucified G4957 (PerfPasPtc) with him G0846 reviled G3679 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
015:033 And G1161 when G1096 the sixth G1623 hour G5610 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) darkness G4655 over G1909 the whole G3650 land G1093 until G2193 the ninth G1766 hour G5610.
015:034 And G2532 at the ninth G1766 hour G5610 Jesus G2424 cried G0994 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Eloi G1682, Eloi G1682, lama G2982 sabachthani G4518? which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd), being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc), My G3450 God G2316, my G3450 God G2316, why G5101 hast G1519 thou forsaken G1459 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165?
015:035 And G2532 some of them G5100 that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc), when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he calleth G5455 (PresActInd) Elias G2243.
015:036 And G1161 one G1520 ran G5143 (Aor2ActPtc) and G2532 filled G1072 a spunge G4699 full G1072 (AorActPtc) of vinegar G3690, and G5037 put [it] on G4060 (Aor2ActPtc) a reed G2563, and gave G4222 him G0846 to drink G4222 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Let alone G0863 (Aor2ActImpr); let us see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) whether G1487 Elias G2243 will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to take G2507 him G0846 down G2507 (Aor2ActInf).
015:037 And G1161 Jesus G2424 cried G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, and gave up the ghost G1606 (AorActInd).
015:038 And G2532 the veil G2665 of the temple G3485 was rent G4977 (AorPasInd) in G1519 twain G1417 from G0575 the top G0509 to G2193 the bottom G2736.
015:039 And G1161 when the centurion G2760, which G3588 stood G3936 (PerfActPtc) over G1537 against G1727 him G0846, saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he so G3779 cried out G2896 (AorActPtc), and gave up the ghost G1606 (AorActInd), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Truly G0230 this G3778 man G0444 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
015:040 There G1161 were G2258 (ImpfInd) also G2532 women G1135 looking G2334 (PresActPtc) on afar G3113 off G0575: among G2532 G1722 whom G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, and G2532 Mary G3137 the mother G3384 of James G2385 the less G3398 and G2532 of Joses G2500, and G2532 Salome G4539;
015:041 (Who G3739 also G2532, when G3753 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 Galilee G1056, followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846;) and G2532 many G4183 other G0243 women which G3588 came up G4872 (Aor2ActPtc) with him G0846 unto G1519 Jerusalem G2414.
015:042 And G2532 now G2235 when the even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), because G1893 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) the preparation G3904, that G3603 is G2076 (PresInd), the day before the sabbath G4315,
015:043 Joseph G2501 of G0575 Arimathaea G0707, an honourable G2158 counsellor G1010, which G3739 also G2532 G0846 waited G4327 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for G2258 (ImpfInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) boldly G5111 (AorActPtc) unto G4314 Pilate G4091, and G2532 craved G0154 (AorMidInd) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424.
015:044 And G1161 Pilate G4091 marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) if G1487 he were G2348 already G2235 dead G2348 (PerfActInd): and G2532 calling G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) [unto him] the centurion G2760, he asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846 whether G1487 he had been G0599 any while G3819 dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
015:045 And G2532 when he knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) [it] of G0575 the centurion G2760, he gave G1433 (AorMidDepInd) the body G4983 to Joseph G2501.
015:046 And G2532 he bought G0059 (AorActPtc) fine linen G4616, and G2532 took him down G2507 (Aor2ActPtc), and wrapped G1750 (AorActInd) him G0846 in the linen G4616, and G2532 laid G2698 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 a sepulchre G3419 which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) hewn G2998 (PerfPasPtc) out of G1537 a rock G4073, and G2532 rolled G4351 (AorActInd) a stone G3037 unto G1909 the door G2374 of the sepulchre G3419.
015:047 And G1161 Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094 and G2532 Mary G3137 [the mother] of Joses G2500 beheld G2334 (ImpfActInd) where G4226 he was laid G5087 (PresPasInd).
016:001 ¶ And G2532 when G1230 the sabbath G4521 was past G1230 (Aor2MidDepPtc), Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, and G2532 Mary G3137 the [mother] G3588 of James G2385, and G2532 Salome G4539, had bought G0059 (AorActInd) sweet spices G0759, that G2443 they might come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and anoint G0218 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
016:002 And G2532 very G3029 early in the morning G4404 the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521, they came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G1909 the sepulchre G3419 at the rising G0393 (AorActPtc) of the sun G2246.
016:003 And G2532 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd) among G4314 themselves G1438, Who G5101 shall roll G0617 us G2254 away G0617 (FutActInd) the stone G3037 from G1537 the door G2374 of the sepulchre G3419?
016:004 And G2532 when they looked G0308 (AorActPtc), they saw G2334 (PresActInd) that G3754 the stone G3037 was rolled away G0617 (PerfPasInd): for G1063 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) very G4970 great G3173.
016:005 And G2532 entering G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the sepulchre G3419, they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a young man G3495 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1722 the right side G1188, clothed G4016 (PerfPasPtc) in a long white G3022 garment G4749; and G2532 they were affrighted G1568 (AorPasInd).
016:006 And G1161 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Be G1568 not G3361 affrighted G1568 (PresPasImpr): Ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3479, which G3588 was crucified G4717 (PerfPasPtc): he is risen G1453 (AorPasInd); he is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 here G5602: behold G2396 the place G5117 where G3699 they laid G5087 (AorActInd) him G0846.
016:007 But G0235 go your way G5217 (PresActImpr), tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) his G0846 disciples G3101 and G2532 Peter G4074 that G3754 he goeth before G4254 (PresActInd) you G5209 into G1519 Galilee G1056: there G1563 shall ye see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) him G0846, as G2531 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213.
016:008 And G2532 they went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) quickly G5035, and fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 the sepulchre G3419; for G1161 they G0846 trembled G2192 (ImpfActInd) G5156 and G2532 were amazed G1611: neither G2532 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) any thing G3762 to any G3762 [man]; for G1063 they were afraid G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
016:009 Now G1161 when [Jesus] was risen G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) early G4404 the first G4413 [day] of the week G4521, he appeared G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj) first G4412 to Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, out of G0575 whom G3739 he had cast G1544 (PlupfActInd) seven G2033 devils G1140.
016:010 [And] she G1565 went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and told G0518 (AorActInd) them that had been G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) with G3326 him G0846, as they mourned G3996 (PresActPtc) and G2532 wept G2799 (PresActPtc).
016:011 And they G2548, when they had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 he was alive G2198 (PresActInd), and G2532 had been seen G2300 (AorPasInd) of G5259 her G0846, believed not G0569 (AorActInd).
016:012 After G1161 G3326 that G5023 he appeared G5319 (AorPasInd) in G1722 another G2087 form G3444 unto two G1417 of G1537 them G0846, as they walked G4043 (PresActPtc), and went G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the country G0068.
016:013 And they G2548 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and told G0518 (AorActInd) [it] unto the residue G3062: neither G3761 believed they G4100 (AorActInd) them G1565.
016:014 Afterward G5305 he appeared G5319 (AorPasInd) unto the eleven G1733 as they G0846 sat at meat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 upbraided G3679 (AorActInd) them with their G0846 unbelief G0570 and G2532 hardness of heart G4641, because G3754 they believed G4100 (AorActInd) not G3756 them which had seen G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) him G0846 after he was risen G1453 (PerfPasPtc).
016:015 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go ye G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) into G1519 all G0537 the world G2889, and preach G2784 (AorActImpr) the gospel G2098 to every G3956 creature G2937.
016:016 He that believeth G4100 (AorActPtc) and G2532 is baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc) shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd); but G1161 he that believeth not G0569 (AorActPtc) shall be damned G2632 (FutPasInd).
016:017 And G1161 these G5023 signs G4592 shall follow G3877 (FutActInd) them that believe G4100 (AorActPtc); In G1722 my G3450 name G3686 shall they cast out G1544 (FutActInd) devils G1140; they shall speak G2980 (FutActInd) with new G2537 tongues G1100;
016:018 They shall take up G0142 (FutActInd) serpents G3789; and if G2579 they drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) any G5100 deadly G2286 thing G5100, it shall not G3364 hurt G0984 (FutActInd) them G0846; they shall lay G2007 (FutActInd) hands G5495 on G1909 the sick G0732, and G2532 they shall G2192 (FutActInd) recover G2573.
016:019 So G3303 then G3767 after G3326 the Lord G2962 had spoken G2980 (AorActInf) unto them G0846, he was received up G0353 (AorPasInd) into G1519 heaven G3772, and G2532 sat G2523 (AorActInd) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of God G2316.
016:020 And G1161 they G1565 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and preached G2784 (AorActInd) every where G3837, the Lord G2962 working with G4903 (PresActPtc) [them], and G2532 confirming G0950 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 with G1223 signs G4592 following G1872 (PresActPtc). Amen G0281.
