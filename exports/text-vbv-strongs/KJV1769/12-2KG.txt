001:001 ¶ Then Moab H4124 rebelled H6586 (8799) against Israel H3478 after H0310 the death H4194 of Ahab H0256.
001:002 And Ahaziah H0274 fell down H5307 (8799) through a lattice H7639 in his upper chamber H5944 that [was] in Samaria H8111, and was sick H2470 (8799): and he sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Go H3212 (8798), enquire H1875 (8798) of Baalzebub H1176 the god H0430 of Ekron H6138 whether I shall recover H2421 (8799) of this disease H2483.
001:003 But the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765) to Elijah H0452 the Tishbite H8664, Arise H6965 (8798), go up H5927 (8798) to meet H7125 (8800) the messengers H4397 of the king H4428 of Samaria H8111, and say H1696 (8761) unto them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God H0430 in Israel H3478, [that] ye go H1980 (8802) to enquire H1875 (8800) of Baalzebub H1176 the god H0430 of Ekron H6138?
001:004 Now therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Thou shalt not come down H3381 (8799) from that bed H4296 on which thou art gone up H5927 (8804), but shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799). And Elijah H0452 departed H3212 (8799).
001:005 And when the messengers H4397 turned back H7725 (8799) unto him, he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Why are ye now H2088 turned back H7725 (8804)?
001:006 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, There came H5927 a man H0376 up H5927 (8804) to meet H7125 (8800) us, and said H0559 (8799) unto us, Go H3212 (8798), turn again H7725 (8798) unto the king H4428 that sent H7971 (8804) you, and say H1696 (8765) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God H0430 in Israel H3478, [that] thou sendest H7971 (8802) to enquire H1875 (8800) of Baalzebub H1176 the god H0430 of Ekron H6138? therefore thou shalt not come down H3381 (8799) from that bed H4296 on which thou art gone up H5927 (8804), but shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
001:007 And he said H1696 (8762) unto them, What manner H4941 of man H0376 [was he] which came up H5927 (8804) to meet H7125 (8800) you, and told H1696 (8762) you these words H1697?
001:008 And they answered H0559 (8799) him, [He was] an hairy H8181 man H1167 H0376, and girt H0247 (8803) with a girdle H0232 of leather H5785 about his loins H4975. And he said H0559 (8799), It [is] Elijah H0452 the Tishbite H8664.
001:009 Then the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) unto him a captain H8269 of fifty H2572 with his fifty H2572. And he went up H5927 (8799) to him: and, behold, he sat H3427 (8802) on the top H7218 of an hill H2022. And he spake H1696 (8762) unto him, Thou man H0376 of God H0430, the king H4428 hath said H1696 (8765), Come down H3381 (8798).
001:010 And Elijah H0452 answered H6030 (8799) and said H1696 (8762) to the captain H8269 of fifty H2572, If I [be] a man H0376 of God H0430, then let fire H0784 come down H3381 (8799) from heaven H8064, and consume H0398 (8799) thee and thy fifty H2572. And there came down H3381 (8799) fire H0784 from heaven H8064, and consumed H0398 (8799) him and his fifty H2572.
001:011 Again H7725 (8799) also he sent H7971 (8799) unto him another H0312 captain H8269 of fifty H2572 with his fifty H2572. And he answered H6030 (8799) and said H1696 (8762) unto him, O man H0376 of God H0430, thus hath the king H4428 said H0559 (8804), Come down H3381 (8798) quickly H4120.
001:012 And Elijah H0452 answered H6030 (8799) and said H1696 (8762) unto them, If I [be] a man H0376 of God H0430, let fire H0784 come down H3381 (8799) from heaven H8064, and consume H0398 (8799) thee and thy fifty H2572. And the fire H0784 of God H0430 came down H3381 (8799) from heaven H8064, and consumed H0398 (8799) him and his fifty H2572.
001:013 And he sent H7971 (8799) again H7725 (8799) a captain H8269 of the third H7992 fifty H2572 with his fifty H2572. And the third H7992 captain H8269 of fifty H2572 went up H5927 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) and fell H3766 (8799) on his knees H1290 before H5048 Elijah H0452, and besought H2603 (8691) him, and said H1696 (8762) unto him, O man H0376 of God H0430, I pray thee, let my life H5315, and the life H5315 of these fifty H2572 thy servants H5650, be precious H3365 (8799) in thy sight H5869.
001:014 Behold, there came H3381 fire H0784 down H3381 (8804) from heaven H8064, and burnt up H0398 (8799) the two H8147 captains H8269 of the former H7223 fifties H2572 with their fifties H2572: therefore let my life H5315 now be precious H3365 (8799) in thy sight H5869.
001:015 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8762) unto Elijah H0452, Go down H3381 (8798) with him: be not afraid H3372 (8799) of him H6440. And he arose H6965 (8799), and went down H3381 (8799) with him unto the king H4428.
001:016 And he said H1696 (8762) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Forasmuch as thou hast sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 to enquire H1875 (8800) of Baalzebub H1176 the god H0430 of Ekron H6138, [is it] not because [there is] no God H0430 in Israel H3478 to enquire H1875 (8800) of his word H1697? therefore thou shalt not come down H3381 (8799) off that bed H4296 on which thou art gone up H5927 (8804), but shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
001:017 So he died H4191 (8799) according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which Elijah H0452 had spoken H1696 (8765). And Jehoram H3088 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead in the second H8147 year H8141 of Jehoram H3088 the son H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063; because he had no son H1121.
001:018 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Ahaziah H0274 which he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
002:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when the LORD H3068 would take up H5927 (8687) Elijah H0452 into heaven H8064 by a whirlwind H5591, that Elijah H0452 went H3212 (8799) with Elisha H0477 from Gilgal H1537.
002:002 And Elijah H0452 said H0559 (8799) unto Elisha H0477, Tarry H3427 (8798) here, I pray thee; for the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) me to Bethel H1008. And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) [unto him, As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, I will not leave H5800 (8799) thee. So they went down H3381 (8799) to Bethel H1008.
002:003 And the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 that [were] at Bethel H1008 came forth H3318 (8799) to Elisha H0477, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Knowest H3045 (8804) thou that the LORD H3068 will take away H3947 (8802) thy master H0113 from thy head H7218 to day H3117? And he said H0559 (8799), Yea, I know H3045 (8804) [it]; hold ye your peace H2814 (8685).
002:004 And Elijah H0452 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Elisha H0477, tarry H3427 (8798) here, I pray thee; for the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) me to Jericho H3405. And he said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, I will not leave H5800 (8799) thee. So they came H0935 (8799) to Jericho H3405.
002:005 And the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 that [were] at Jericho H3405 came H5066 (8799) to Elisha H0477, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Knowest H3045 (8804) thou that the LORD H3068 will take away H3947 (8802) thy master H0113 from thy head H7218 to day H3117? And he answered H0559 (8799), Yea, I know H3045 (8804) [it]; hold ye your peace H2814 (8685).
002:006 And Elijah H0452 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Tarry H3427 (8798), I pray thee, here; for the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) me to Jordan H3383. And he said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, I will not leave H5800 (8799) thee. And they two H8147 went on H3212 (8799).
002:007 And fifty H2572 men H0376 of the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 went H1980 (8804), and stood H5975 (8799) to view H5048 afar off H7350: and they two H8147 stood H5975 (8804) by Jordan H3383.
002:008 And Elijah H0452 took H3947 (8799) his mantle H0155, and wrapped [it] together H1563 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) the waters H4325, and they were divided H2673 (8735) hither and thither, so that they two H8147 went over H5674 (8799) on dry H2724 ground.
002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over H5674 (8800), that Elijah H0452 said H0559 (8804) unto Elisha H0477, Ask H7592 (8798) what I shall do H6213 (8799) for thee, before I be taken away H3947 (8735) from thee. And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799), I pray thee, let a double H8147 portion H6310 of thy spirit H7307 be upon me.
002:010 And he said H0559 (8799), Thou hast asked H7592 (8800) a hard thing H7185 (8689): [nevertheless], if thou see H7200 (8799) me [when I am] taken H3947 (8795) from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be [so].
002:011 And it came to pass, as they still H1980 (8800) went on H1980 (8802), and talked H1696 (8763), that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot H7393 of fire H0784, and horses H5483 of fire H0784, and parted H6504 (8686) them both H8147 asunder H0996; and Elijah H0452 went up H5927 (8799) by a whirlwind H5591 into heaven H8064.
002:012 And Elisha H0477 saw H7200 (8802) [it], and he cried H6817 (8764), My father H0001, my father H0001, the chariot H7393 of Israel H3478, and the horsemen H6571 thereof. And he saw H7200 (8804) him no more: and he took hold H2388 (8686) of his own clothes H0899, and rent H7167 (8799) them in two H8147 pieces H7168.
002:013 He took up H7311 (8686) also the mantle H0155 of Elijah H0452 that fell H5307 (8804) from him, and went back H7725 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) by the bank H8193 of Jordan H3383;
002:014 And he took H3947 (8799) the mantle H0155 of Elijah H0452 that fell H5307 (8804) from him, and smote H5221 (8686) the waters H4325, and said H0559 (8799), Where [is] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Elijah H0452? and when he also had smitten H5221 (8686) the waters H4325, they parted H2673 (8735) hither and thither: and Elisha H0477 went over H5674 (8799).
002:015 And when the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 which [were] to view at Jericho H3405 saw H7200 (8799) him, they said H0559 (8799), The spirit H7307 of Elijah H0452 doth rest H5117 (8804) on Elisha H0477. And they came H0935 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and bowed H7812 (8691) themselves to the ground H0776 before him.
002:016 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Behold now, there be H3426 with thy servants H5650 fifty H2572 strong H2428 men H1121 H0582; let them go H3212 (8799), we pray thee, and seek H1245 (8762) thy master H0113: lest peradventure the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 hath taken him up H5375 (8804), and cast H7993 (8686) him upon some H0259 mountain H2022, or into some H0259 valley H1516. And he said H0559 (8799), Ye shall not send H7971 (8799).
002:017 And when they urged H6484 (8799) him till he was ashamed H0954 (8800), he said H0559 (8799), Send H7971 (8798). They sent H7971 (8799) therefore fifty H2572 men H0376; and they sought H1245 (8762) three H7969 days H3117, but found H4672 (8804) him not.
002:018 And when they came again H7725 (8799) to him, (for he tarried H3427 (8802) at Jericho H3405,) he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Did I not say H0559 (8804) unto you, Go H3212 (8799) not?
002:019 And the men H0582 of the city H5892 said H0559 (8799) unto Elisha H0477, Behold, I pray thee, the situation H4186 of this city H5892 [is] pleasant H2896, as my lord H0113 seeth H7200 (8802): but the water H4325 [is] naught H7451, and the ground H0776 barren H7921 (8764).
002:020 And he said H0559 (8799), Bring H3947 (8798) me a new H2319 cruse H6746, and put H7760 (8798) salt H4417 therein. And they brought H3947 (8799) [it] to him.
002:021 And he went forth H3318 (8799) unto the spring H4161 of the waters H4325, and cast H7993 (8686) the salt H4417 in there, and said H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, I have healed H7495 (8765) these waters H4325; there shall not be from thence any more death H4194 or barren H7921 (8764) [land].
002:022 So the waters H4325 were healed H7495 (8735) unto this day H3117, according to the saying H1697 of Elisha H0477 which he spake H1696 (8765).
002:023 And he went up H5927 (8799) from thence unto Bethel H1008: and as he was going up H5927 (8802) by the way H1870, there came forth H3318 (8804) little H6996 children H5288 out of the city H5892, and mocked H7046 (8691) him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go up H5927 (8798), thou bald head H7142; go up H5927 (8798), thou bald head H7142.
002:024 And he turned H6437 (8799) back H0310, and looked H7200 (8799) on them, and cursed H7043 (8762) them in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068. And there came forth H3318 (8799) two H8147 she bears H1677 out of the wood H3293, and tare H1234 (8762) forty H0705 and two H8147 children H3206 of them.
002:025 And he went H3212 (8799) from thence to mount H2022 Carmel H3760, and from thence he returned H7725 (8804) to Samaria H8111.
003:001 ¶ Now Jehoram H3088 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 began to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111 the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and reigned H4427 (8799) twelve H8147 H6240 years H8141.
003:002 And he wrought H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068; but not like his father H0001, and like his mother H0517: for he put away H5493 (8686) the image H4676 of Baal H1168 that his father H0001 had made H6213 (8804).
003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved H1692 (8804) unto the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, which made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689); he departed H5493 (8804) not therefrom.
003:004 And Mesha H4338 king H4428 of Moab H4124 was a sheepmaster H5349, and rendered H7725 (8689) unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478 an hundred H3967 thousand H0505 lambs H3733, and an hundred H3967 thousand H0505 rams H0352, with the wool H6785.
003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab H0256 was dead H4194, that the king H4428 of Moab H4124 rebelled H6586 (8799) against the king H4428 of Israel H3478.
003:006 And king H4428 Jehoram H3088 went out H3318 (8799) of Samaria H8111 the same time H3117, and numbered H6485 (8799) all Israel H3478.
003:007 And he went H3212 (8799) and sent H7971 (8799) to Jehoshaphat H3092 the king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), The king H4428 of Moab H4124 hath rebelled H6586 (8804) against me: wilt thou go H3212 (8799) with me against Moab H4124 to battle H4421? And he said H0559 (8799), I will go up H5927 (8799): I [am] as thou [art], my people H5971 as thy people H5971, [and] my horses H5483 as thy horses H5483.
003:008 And he said H0559 (8799), Which way H1870 shall we go up H5927 (8799)? And he answered H0559 (8799), The way H1870 through the wilderness H4057 of Edom H0123.
003:009 So the king H4428 of Israel H3478 went H3212 (8799), and the king H4428 of Judah H3063, and the king H4428 of Edom H0123: and they fetched a compass H5437 (8799) of seven H7651 days H3117 ’ journey H1870: and there was no water H4325 for the host H4264, and for the cattle H0929 that followed H7272 them.
003:010 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Alas H0162! that the LORD H3068 hath called H7121 these three H7969 kings H4428 together H7121 (8804), to deliver H5414 (8800) them into the hand H3027 of Moab H4124!
003:011 But Jehoshaphat H3092 said H0559 (8799), [Is there] not here a prophet H5030 of the LORD H3068, that we may enquire H1875 (8799) of the LORD H3068 by him? And one H0259 of the king H4428 of Israel’s H3478 servants H5650 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Here [is] Elisha H0477 the son H1121 of Shaphat H8202, which poured H3332 (8804) water H4325 on the hands H3027 of Elijah H0452.
003:012 And Jehoshaphat H3092 said H0559 (8799), The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 is H3426 with him. So the king H4428 of Israel H3478 and Jehoshaphat H3092 and the king H4428 of Edom H0123 went down H3381 (8799) to him.
003:013 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478, What have I to do with thee? get H3212 (8798) thee to the prophets H5030 of thy father H0001, and to the prophets H5030 of thy mother H0517. And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Nay: for the LORD H3068 hath called H7121 these three H7969 kings H4428 together H7121 (8804), to deliver H5414 (8800) them into the hand H3027 of Moab H4124.
003:014 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 liveth H2416, before H6440 whom I stand H5975 (8804), surely, were it not that H3884 I regard H5375 (8802) the presence H6440 of Jehoshaphat H3092 the king H4428 of Judah H3063, I would not look H5027 (8686) toward thee, nor see H7200 (8799) thee.
003:015 But now bring H3947 (8798) me a minstrel H5059 (8764). And it came to pass, when the minstrel H5059 (8764) played H5059 (8763), that the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 came upon him.
003:016 And he said H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Make H6213 (8800) this valley H5158 full of ditches H1356.
003:017 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Ye shall not see H7200 (8799) wind H7307, neither shall ye see H7200 (8799) rain H1653; yet that valley H5158 shall be filled H4390 (8735) with water H4325, that ye may drink H8354 (8804), both ye, and your cattle H4735, and your beasts H0929.
003:018 And this is [but] a light thing H7043 (8738) in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he will deliver H5414 (8804) the Moabites H4124 also into your hand H3027.
003:019 And ye shall smite H5221 (8689) every fenced H4013 city H5892, and every choice H4004 city H5892, and shall fell H5307 (8686) every good H2896 tree H6086, and stop H5640 (8799) all wells H4599 of water H4325, and mar H3510 (8686) every good H2896 piece H2513 of land with stones H0068.
003:020 And it came to pass in the morning H1242, when the meat offering H4503 was offered H5927 (8800), that, behold, there came H0935 (8802) water H4325 by the way H1870 of Edom H0123, and the country H0776 was filled H4390 (8735) with water H4325.
003:021 And when all the Moabites H4124 heard H8085 (8804) that the kings H4428 were come up H5927 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) against them, they gathered H6817 (8735) all that were able to put H2296 (8802) on armour H2290, and upward H4605, and stood H5975 (8799) in the border H1366.
003:022 And they rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and the sun H8121 shone H2224 (8804) upon the water H4325, and the Moabites H4124 saw H7200 (8799) the water H4325 on the other side H5048 [as] red H0122 as blood H1818:
003:023 And they said H0559 (8799), This [is] blood H1818: the kings H4428 are surely H2717 (8715) slain H2717 (8738), and they have smitten H5221 (8686) one H0376 another H7453: now therefore, Moab H4124, to the spoil H7998.
003:024 And when they came H0935 (8799) to the camp H4264 of Israel H3478, the Israelites H3478 rose up H6965 (8799) and smote H5221 (8686) the Moabites H4124, so that they fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 them: but they went forward H5221 (8686) smiting H5221 (8687) the Moabites H4124, even in [their] country.
003:025 And they beat down H2040 (8799) the cities H5892, and on every good H2896 piece H2513 of land cast H7993 (8686) every man H0376 his stone H0068, and filled H4390 (8765) it; and they stopped H5640 (8799) all the wells H4599 of water H4325, and felled H5307 (8686) all the good H2896 trees H6086: only in Kirharaseth H7025 left H7604 (8689) they the stones H0068 thereof; howbeit the slingers H7051 went about H5437 (8799) [it], and smote H5221 (8686) it.
003:026 And when the king H4428 of Moab H4124 saw H7200 (8799) that the battle H4421 was too sore H2388 (8804) for him, he took H3947 (8799) with him seven H7651 hundred H3967 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) swords H2719, to break through H1234 (8687) [even] unto the king H4428 of Edom H0123: but they could H3201 (8804) not.
003:027 Then he took H3947 (8799) his eldest H1060 son H1121 that should have reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead, and offered H5927 (8686) him [for] a burnt offering H5930 upon the wall H2346. And there was great H1419 indignation H7110 against Israel H3478: and they departed H5265 (8799) from him, and returned H7725 (8799) to [their own] land H0776.
004:001 ¶ Now there cried H6817 (8804) a certain H0259 woman H0802 of the wives H0802 of the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 unto Elisha H0477, saying H0559 (8800), Thy servant H5650 my husband H0376 is dead H4191 (8804); and thou knowest H3045 (8804) that thy servant H5650 did fear H3373 the LORD H3068: and the creditor H5383 (8802) is come H0935 (8804) to take H3947 (8800) unto him my two H8147 sons H3206 to be bondmen H5650.
004:002 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto her, What shall I do H6213 (8799) for thee? tell H5046 (8685) me, what hast H3426 thou in the house H1004? And she said H0559 (8799), Thine handmaid H8198 hath not any thing in the house H1004, save a pot H0610 of oil H8081.
004:003 Then he said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798), borrow H7592 (8798) thee vessels H3627 abroad H2351 of all thy neighbours H7934, [even] empty H7386 vessels H3627; borrow not a few H4591 (8686).
004:004 And when thou art come in H0935 (8804), thou shalt shut H5462 (8804) the door H1817 upon thee and upon thy sons H1121, and shalt pour out H3332 (8804) into all those vessels H3627, and thou shalt set aside H5265 (8686) that which is full H4392.
004:005 So she went H3212 (8799) from him, and shut H5462 (8799) the door H1817 upon her and upon H1157 her sons H1121, who H1992 brought H5066 (8688) [the vessels] to her; and she poured out H3332 (8716).
004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels H3627 were full H4390 (8800), that she said H0559 (8799) unto her son H1121, Bring H5066 (8685) me yet a vessel H3627. And he said H0559 (8799) unto her, [There is] not a vessel H3627 more. And the oil H8081 stayed H5975 (8799).
004:007 Then she came H0935 (8799) and told H5046 (8686) the man H0376 of God H0430. And he said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798), sell H4376 (8798) the oil H8081, and pay H7999 (8761) thy debt H5386, and live H2421 (8799) thou and thy children H1121 of the rest H3498 (8737).
004:008 And it fell on a day H3117, that Elisha H0477 passed H5674 (8799) to Shunem H7766, where [was] a great H1419 woman H0802; and she constrained H2388 (8686) him to eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899. And [so] it was, [that] as oft H1767 as he passed by H5674 (8800), he turned H5493 (8799) in thither to eat H0398 (8800) bread H3899.
004:009 And she said H0559 (8799) unto her husband H0376, Behold now, I perceive H3045 (8804) that this [is] an holy H6918 man H0376 of God H0430, which passeth H5674 (8802) by us continually H8548.
004:010 Let us make H6213 (8799) a little H6996 chamber H5944, I pray thee, on the wall H7023; and let us set H7760 (8799) for him there a bed H4296, and a table H7979, and a stool H3678, and a candlestick H4501: and it shall be, when he cometh H0935 (8800) to us, that he shall turn H5493 (8799) in thither.
004:011 And it fell on a day H3117, that he came H0935 (8799) thither, and he turned H5493 (8799) into the chamber H5944, and lay H7901 (8799) there.
004:012 And he said H0559 (8799) to Gehazi H1522 his servant H5288, Call H7121 (8798) this Shunammite H7767. And when he had called H7121 (8799) her, she stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 him.
004:013 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Say H0559 (8798) now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful H2729 (8804) for us with all this care H2731; what [is] to be done H6213 (8800) for thee? wouldest H3426 thou be spoken H1696 (8763) for to the king H4428, or to the captain H8269 of the host H6635? And she answered H0559 (8799), I dwell H3427 (8802) among H8432 mine own people H5971.
004:014 And he said H0559 (8799), What then [is] to be done H6213 (8800) for her? And Gehazi H1522 answered H0559 (8799), Verily H0061 she hath no child H1121, and her husband H0376 is old H2204 (8804).
004:015 And he said H0559 (8799), Call H7121 (8798) her. And when he had called H7121 (8799) her, she stood H5975 (8799) in the door H6607.
004:016 And he said H0559 (8799), About this season H4150, according to the time H6256 of life H2416, thou shalt embrace H2263 (8802) a son H1121. And she said H0559 (8799), Nay, my lord H0113, [thou] man H0376 of God H0430, do not lie H3576 (8762) unto thine handmaid H8198.
004:017 And the woman H0802 conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121 at that season H4150 that Elisha H0477 had said H1696 (8765) unto her, according to the time H6256 of life H2416.
004:018 And when the child H3206 was grown H1431 (8799), it fell on a day H3117, that he went out H3318 (8799) to his father H0001 to the reapers H7114 (8802).
004:019 And he said H0559 (8799) unto his father H0001, My head H7218, my head H7218. And he said H0559 (8799) to a lad H5288, Carry H5375 (8798) him to his mother H0517.
004:020 And when he had taken H5375 (8799) him, and brought H0935 (8686) him to his mother H0517, he sat H3427 (8799) on her knees H1290 till noon H6672, and [then] died H4191 (8799).
004:021 And she went up H5927 (8799), and laid H7901 (8686) him on the bed H4296 of the man H0376 of God H0430, and shut H5462 (8799) [the door] upon him, and went out H3318 (8799).
004:022 And she called H7121 (8799) unto her husband H0376, and said H0559 (8799), Send H7971 (8798) me, I pray thee, one H0259 of the young men H5288, and one H0259 of the asses H0860, that I may run H7323 (8799) to the man H0376 of God H0430, and come again H7725 (8799).
004:023 And he said H0559 (8799), Wherefore wilt thou go H1980 (8802) to him to day H3117? [it is] neither new moon H2320, nor sabbath H7676. And she said H0559 (8799), [It shall be] well H7965.
004:024 Then she saddled H2280 (8799) an ass H0860, and said H0559 (8799) to her servant H5288, Drive H5090 (8798), and go forward H3212 (8798); slack H6113 (8799) not [thy] riding H7392 (8800) for me, except I bid H0559 (8804) thee.
004:025 So she went H3212 (8799) and came H0935 (8799) unto the man H0376 of God H0430 to mount H2022 Carmel H3760. And it came to pass, when the man H0376 of God H0430 saw her afar off H7200 (8800), that he said H0559 (8799) to Gehazi H1522 his servant H5288, Behold, [yonder is] that H1975 Shunammite H7767:
004:026 Run H7323 (8798) now, I pray thee, to meet H7125 (8800) her, and say H0559 (8798) unto her, [Is it] well H7965 with thee? [is it] well H7965 with thy husband H0376? [is it] well H7965 with the child H3206? And she answered H0559 (8799), [It is] well H7965.
004:027 And when she came H0935 (8799) to the man H0376 of God H0430 to the hill H2022, she caught H2388 (8686) him by the feet H7272: but Gehazi H1522 came near H5066 (8799) to thrust her away H1920 (8800). And the man H0376 of God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Let her alone H7503 (8685); for her soul H5315 [is] vexed H4843 (8804) within her: and the LORD H3068 hath hid H5956 (8689) [it] from me, and hath not told H5046 (8689) me.
004:028 Then she said H0559 (8799), Did I desire H7592 (8804) a son H1121 of my lord H0113? did I not say H0559 (8804), Do not deceive H7952 (8686) me?
004:029 Then he said H0559 (8799) to Gehazi H1522, Gird up H2296 (8798) thy loins H4975, and take H3947 (8798) my staff H4938 in thine hand H3027, and go thy way H3212 (8798): if thou meet H4672 (8799) any man H0376, salute H1288 (8762) him not; and if any H0376 salute H1288 (8762) thee, answer him not again H6030 (8799): and lay H7760 (8804) my staff H4938 upon the face H6440 of the child H5288.
004:030 And the mother H0517 of the child H5288 said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, and [as] thy soul H5315 liveth H2416, I will not leave H5800 (8799) thee. And he arose H6965 (8799), and followed H3212 (8799) H0310 her.
004:031 And Gehazi H1522 passed on H5674 (8804) before H6440 them, and laid H7760 (8799) the staff H4938 upon the face H6440 of the child H5288; but [there was] neither voice H6963, nor hearing H7182. Wherefore he went again H7725 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), The child H5288 is not awaked H6974 (8689).
004:032 And when Elisha H0477 was come H0935 (8799) into the house H1004, behold, the child H5288 was dead H4191 (8801), [and] laid H7901 (8716) upon his bed H4296.
004:033 He went in H0935 (8799) therefore, and shut H5462 (8799) the door H1817 upon them twain H8147, and prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068.
004:034 And he went up H5927 (8799), and lay H7901 (8799) upon the child H3206, and put H7760 (8799) his mouth H6310 upon his mouth H6310, and his eyes H5869 upon his eyes H5869, and his hands H3709 upon his hands H3709: and he stretched H1457 (8799) himself upon the child; and the flesh H1320 of the child H3206 waxed warm H2552 (8799).
004:035 Then he returned H7725 (8799), and walked H3212 (8799) in the house H1004 to H0259 H2008 and fro H0259 H2008; and went up H5927 (8799), and stretched H1457 (8799) himself upon him: and the child H5288 sneezed H2237 (8779) seven H7651 times H6471, and the child H5288 opened H6491 (8799) his eyes H5869.
004:036 And he called H7121 (8799) Gehazi H1522, and said H0559 (8799), Call H7121 (8798) this Shunammite H7767. So he called H7121 (8799) her. And when she was come in H0935 (8799) unto him, he said H0559 (8799), Take up H5375 (8798) thy son H1121.
004:037 Then she went in H0935 (8799), and fell H5307 (8799) at his feet H7272, and bowed H7812 (8691) herself to the ground H0776, and took up H5375 (8799) her son H1121, and went out H3318 (8799).
004:038 And Elisha H0477 came again H7725 (8804) to Gilgal H1537: and [there was] a dearth H7458 in the land H0776; and the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 [were] sitting H3427 (8802) before H6440 him: and he said H0559 (8799) unto his servant H5288, Set H8239 (8798) on the great H1419 pot H5518, and seethe H1310 (8761) pottage H5138 for the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030.
004:039 And one H0259 went out H3318 (8799) into the field H7704 to gather H3950 (8763) herbs H0219, and found H4672 (8799) a wild H7704 vine H1612, and gathered H3950 (8762) thereof wild H7704 gourds H6498 his lap H0899 full H4393, and came H0935 (8799) and shred H6398 (8762) [them] into the pot H5518 of pottage H5138: for they knew H3045 (8804) [them] not.
004:040 So they poured out H3332 (8799) for the men H0582 to eat H0398 (8800). And it came to pass, as they were eating H0398 (8800) of the pottage H5138, that they cried out H6817 (8804), and said H0559 (8799), O [thou] man H0376 of God H0430, [there is] death H4194 in the pot H5518. And they could H3201 (8804) not eat H0398 (8800) [thereof].
004:041 But he said H0559 (8799), Then bring H3947 (8798) meal H7058. And he cast H7993 (8686) [it] into the pot H5518; and he said H0559 (8799), Pour out H3332 (8798) for the people H5971, that they may eat H0398 (8799). And there was no harm H1697 H7451 in the pot H5518.
004:042 And there came H0935 (8802) a man H0376 from Baalshalisha H1190, and brought H0935 (8686) the man H0376 of God H0430 bread H3899 of the firstfruits H1061, twenty H6242 loaves H3899 of barley H8184, and full ears of corn H3759 in the husk H6861 thereof. And he said H0559 (8799), Give H5414 (8798) unto the people H5971, that they may eat H0398 (8799).
004:043 And his servitor H8334 (8764) said H0559 (8799), What, should I set H5414 (8799) this before H6440 an hundred H3967 men H0376? He said again H0559 (8799), Give H5414 (8798) the people H5971, that they may eat H0398 (8799): for thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, They shall eat H0398 (8800), and shall leave H3498 (8687) [thereof].
004:044 So he set H5414 (8799) [it] before H6440 them, and they did eat H0398 (8799), and left H3498 (8686) [thereof], according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
005:001 ¶ Now Naaman H5283, captain H8269 of the host H6635 of the king H4428 of Syria H0758, was a great H1419 man H0376 with H6440 his master H0113, and honourable H5375 (8803), because by him the LORD H3068 had given H5414 (8804) deliverance H8668 unto Syria H0758: he was also a mighty H1368 man H0376 in valour H2428, [but he was] a leper H6879 (8794).
005:002 And the Syrians H0758 had gone out H3318 (8804) by companies H1416, and had brought away captive H7617 (8799) out of the land H0776 of Israel H3478 a little H6996 maid H5291; and she waited on H6440 Naaman’s H5283 wife H0802.
005:003 And she said H0559 (8799) unto her mistress H1404, Would H0305 God my lord H0113 [were] with H6440 the prophet H5030 that [is] in Samaria H8111! for H0227 he would recover H0622 (8799) him of his leprosy H6883.
005:004 And [one] went in H0935 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) his lord H0113, saying H0559 (8800), Thus and thus said H1696 (8765) the maid H5291 that [is] of the land H0776 of Israel H3478.
005:005 And the king H4428 of Syria H0758 said H0559 (8799), Go to H3212 (8798), go H0935 (8798), and I will send H7971 (8799) a letter H5612 unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478. And he departed H3212 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) with him H3027 ten H6235 talents H3603 of silver H3701, and six H8337 thousand H0505 [pieces] of gold H2091, and ten H6235 changes H2487 of raiment H0899.
005:006 And he brought H0935 (8686) the letter H5612 to the king H4428 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Now when this letter H5612 is come H0935 (8800) unto thee, behold, I have [therewith] sent H7971 (8804) Naaman H5283 my servant H5650 to thee, that thou mayest recover H0622 (8804) him of his leprosy H6883.
005:007 And it came to pass, when the king H4428 of Israel H3478 had read H7121 (8800) the letter H5612, that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899, and said H0559 (8799), [Am] I God H0430, to kill H4191 (8687) and to make alive H2421 (8687), that this man H2088 doth send H7971 (8802) unto me to recover H0622 (8800) a man H0376 of his leprosy H6883? wherefore H0389 consider H3045 (8798), I pray you, and see H7200 (8798) how he seeketh a quarrel H0579 (8693) against me.
005:008 And it was [so], when Elisha H0477 the man H0376 of God H0430 had heard H8085 (8800) that the king H4428 of Israel H3478 had rent H7167 (8804) his clothes H0899, that he sent H7971 (8799) to the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), Wherefore hast thou rent H7167 (8804) thy clothes H0899? let him come H0935 (8799) now to me, and he shall know H3045 (8799) that there is H3426 a prophet H5030 in Israel H3478.
005:009 So Naaman H5283 came H0935 (8799) with his horses H5483 and with his chariot H7393, and stood H5975 (8799) at the door H6607 of the house H1004 of Elisha H0477.
005:010 And Elisha H0477 sent H7971 (8799) a messenger H4397 unto him, saying H0559 (8800), Go H1980 (8800) and wash H7364 (8804) in Jordan H3383 seven H7651 times H6471, and thy flesh H1320 shall come again H7725 (8799) to thee, and thou shalt be clean H2891 (8798).
005:011 But Naaman H5283 was wroth H7107 (8799), and went away H3212 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Behold, I thought H0559 (8804), He will surely H3318 (8800) come out H3318 (8799) to me, and stand H5975 (8804), and call H7121 (8804) on the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430, and strike H5130 (8689) his hand H3027 over the place H4725, and recover H0622 (8804) the leper H6879 (8794).
005:012 [Are] not Abana H0071 (8676) H0549 and Pharpar H6554, rivers H5104 of Damascus H1834, better H2896 than all the waters H4325 of Israel H3478? may I not wash H7364 (8799) in them, and be clean H2891 (8804)? So he turned H6437 (8799) and went away H3212 (8799) in a rage H2534.
005:013 And his servants H5650 came near H5066 (8799), and spake H1696 (8762) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), My father H0001, [if] the prophet H5030 had bid H1696 (8765) thee [do some] great H1419 thing H1697, wouldest thou not have done H6213 (8799) [it]? how much rather then H0637, when he saith H0559 (8804) to thee, Wash H7364 (8798), and be clean H2891 (8798)?
005:014 Then went he down H3381 (8799), and dipped H2881 (8799) himself seven H7651 times H6471 in Jordan H3383, according to the saying H1697 of the man H0376 of God H0430: and his flesh H1320 came again H7725 (8799) like unto the flesh H1320 of a little H6996 child H5288, and he was clean H2891 (8799).
005:015 And he returned H7725 (8799) to the man H0376 of God H0430, he and all his company H4264, and came H0935 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 him: and he said H0559 (8799), Behold, now I know H3045 (8804) that [there is] no God H0430 in all the earth H0776, but in Israel H3478: now therefore, I pray thee, take H3947 (8798) a blessing H1293 of thy servant H5650.
005:016 But he said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, before H6440 whom I stand H5975 (8804), I will receive H3947 (8799) none. And he urged H6484 (8799) him to take H3947 (8800) [it]; but he refused H3985 (8762).
005:017 And Naaman H5283 said H0559 (8799), Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given H5414 (8714) to thy servant H5650 two H6776 mules H6505 ’ burden H4853 of earth H0127? for thy servant H5650 will henceforth offer H6213 (8799) neither burnt offering H5930 nor sacrifice H2077 unto other H0312 gods H0430, but unto the LORD H3068.
005:018 In this thing H1697 the LORD H3068 pardon H5545 (8799) thy servant H5650, [that] when my master H0113 goeth H0935 (8800) into the house H1004 of Rimmon H7417 to worship H7812 (8692) there, and he leaneth H8172 (8737) on my hand H3027, and I bow H7812 (8694) myself in the house H1004 of Rimmon H7417: when I bow down H7812 (8692) myself in the house H1004 of Rimmon H7417, the LORD H3068 pardon H5545 (8799) thy servant H5650 in this thing H1697.
005:019 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go H3212 (8798) in peace H7965. So he departed H3212 (8799) from him a little H3530 way H0776.
005:020 But Gehazi H1522, the servant H5288 of Elisha H0477 the man H0376 of God H0430, said H0559 (8799), Behold, my master H0113 hath spared H2820 (8804) Naaman H5283 this Syrian H0761, in not receiving H3947 (8800) at his hands H3027 that which he brought H0935 (8689): but, [as] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, I will run H7323 (8804) after H0310 him, and take H3947 (8804) somewhat H3972 of him.
005:021 So Gehazi H1522 followed H7291 (8799) after H0310 Naaman H5283. And when Naaman H5283 saw H7200 (8799) [him] running H7323 (8801) after H0310 him, he lighted down H5307 (8799) from the chariot H4818 to meet H7125 (8800) him, and said H0559 (8799), [Is] all well H7965?
005:022 And he said H0559 (8799), All [is] well H7965. My master H0113 hath sent H7971 (8804) me, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, even now there be come H0935 (8804) to me from mount H2022 Ephraim H0669 two H8147 young men H5288 of the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030: give H5414 (8798) them, I pray thee, a talent H3603 of silver H3701, and two H8147 changes H2487 of garments H0899.
005:023 And Naaman H5283 said H0559 (8799), Be content H2974 (8685), take H3947 (8798) two talents H3603. And he urged H6555 (8799) him, and bound H6696 (8799) two H8147 talents H3603 of silver H3701 in two H8147 bags H2754, with two H8147 changes H2487 of garments H0899, and laid H5414 (8799) [them] upon two H8147 of his servants H5288; and they bare H5375 (8799) [them] before H6440 him.
005:024 And when he came H0935 (8799) to the tower H6076, he took H3947 (8799) [them] from their hand H3027, and bestowed H6485 (8799) [them] in the house H1004: and he let the men H0582 go H7971 (8762), and they departed H3212 (8799).
005:025 But he went in H0935 (8802), and stood H5975 (8799) before his master H0113. And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Whence H0370 [comest thou], Gehazi H1522? And he said H0559 (8799), Thy servant H5650 went H1980 (8804) no whither H0575.
005:026 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, Went H1980 (8804) not mine heart H3820 [with thee], when the man H0376 turned H2015 (8804) again from his chariot H4818 to meet H7125 (8800) thee? [Is it] a time H6256 to receive H3947 (8800) money H3701, and to receive H3947 (8800) garments H0899, and oliveyards H2132, and vineyards H3754, and sheep H6629, and oxen H1241, and menservants H5650, and maidservants H8198?
005:027 The leprosy H6883 therefore of Naaman H5283 shall cleave H1692 (8799) unto thee, and unto thy seed H2233 for ever H5769. And he went out H3318 (8799) from his presence H6440 a leper H6879 (8794) [as white] as snow H7950.
006:001 ¶ And the sons H1121 of the prophets H5030 said H0559 (8799) unto H6440 Elisha H0477, Behold now, the place H4725 where we dwell H3427 (8802) with thee is too strait H6862 for us.
006:002 Let us go H3212 (8799), we pray thee, unto Jordan H3383, and take H3947 (8799) thence every man H0376 a H0259 beam H6982, and let us make H6213 (8799) us a place H4725 there, where we may dwell H3427 (8800). And he answered H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798) ye.
006:003 And one H0259 said H0559 (8799), Be content H2974 (8685), I pray thee, and go H3212 (8798) with thy servants H5650. And he answered H0559 (8799), I will go H3212 (8799).
006:004 So he went H3212 (8799) with them. And when they came H0935 (8799) to Jordan H3383, they cut down H1504 (8799) wood H6086.
006:005 But as one H0259 was felling H5307 (8688) a beam H6982, the axe head H1270 fell H5307 (8804) into the water H4325: and he cried H6817 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Alas H0162, master H0113! for it was borrowed H7592 (8803).
006:006 And the man H0376 of God H0430 said H0559 (8799), Where H0575 fell H5307 (8804) it? And he shewed H7200 (8686) him the place H4725. And he cut down H7094 (8799) a stick H6086, and cast H7993 (8686) [it] in thither; and the iron H1270 did swim H6687 (8686).
006:007 Therefore said H0559 (8799) he, Take [it] up H7311 (8685) to thee. And he put out H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and took H3947 (8799) it.
006:008 Then the king H4428 of Syria H0758 warred H3898 (8737) against Israel H3478, and took counsel H3289 (8735) with his servants H5650, saying H0559 (8800), In such H6423 and such H0492 a place H4725 [shall be] my camp H8466.
006:009 And the man H0376 of God H0430 sent H7971 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Beware H8104 (8734) that thou pass H5674 (8800) not such H2088 a place H4725; for thither the Syrians H0758 are come down H5185.
006:010 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) to the place H4725 which the man H0376 of God H0430 told H0559 (8804) him and warned H2094 (8689) him of, and saved H8104 (8738) himself there, not once H0259 nor twice H8147.
006:011 Therefore the heart H3820 of the king H4428 of Syria H0758 was sore troubled H5590 (8735) for this thing H1697; and he called H7121 (8799) his servants H5650, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Will ye not shew H5046 (8686) me which of us [is] for the king H4428 of Israel H3478?
006:012 And one H0259 of his servants H5650 said H0559 (8799), None, my lord H0113, O king H4428: but Elisha H0477, the prophet H5030 that [is] in Israel H3478, telleth H5046 (8686) the king H4428 of Israel H3478 the words H1697 that thou speakest H1696 (8762) in thy bedchamber H2315 H4904.
006:013 And he said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798) and spy H7200 (8798) where H0351 he [is], that I may send H7971 (8799) and fetch H3947 (8799) him. And it was told H5046 (8714) him, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, [he is] in Dothan H1886.
006:014 Therefore sent H7971 (8799) he thither horses H5483, and chariots H7393, and a great H3515 host H2428: and they came H0935 (8799) by night H3915, and compassed H5362 the city H5892 about H5362 (8686).
006:015 And when the servant H8334 (8764) of the man H0376 of God H0430 was risen H6965 (8800) early H7925 (8686), and gone forth H3318 (8799), behold, an host H2428 compassed H5437 (8802) the city H5892 both with horses H5483 and chariots H7393. And his servant H5288 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Alas H0162, my master H0113! how shall we do H6213 (8799)?
006:016 And he answered H0559 (8799), Fear H3372 (8799) not: for they that [be] with us [are] more H7227 than they that [be] with them.
006:017 And Elisha H0477 prayed H6419 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), LORD H3068, I pray thee, open H6491 (8798) his eyes H5869, that he may see H7200 (8799). And the LORD H3068 opened H6491 (8799) the eyes H5869 of the young man H5288; and he saw H7200 (8799): and, behold, the mountain H2022 [was] full H4390 (8804) of horses H5483 and chariots H7393 of fire H0784 round about H5439 Elisha H0477.
006:018 And when they came down H3381 (8799) to him, Elisha H0477 prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), Smite H5221 (8685) this people H1471, I pray thee, with blindness H5575. And he smote H5221 (8686) them with blindness H5575 according to the word H1697 of Elisha H0477.
006:019 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto them, This [is] not the way H1870, neither [is] this H2090 the city H5892: follow H3212 (8798) H0310 me, and I will bring H3212 (8686) you to the man H0376 whom ye seek H1245 (8762). But he led H3212 (8686) them to Samaria H8111.
006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come H0935 (8800) into Samaria H8111, that Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799), LORD H3068, open H6491 (8798) the eyes H5869 of these [men], that they may see H7200 (8799). And the LORD H3068 opened H6491 (8799) their eyes H5869, and they saw H7200 (8799); and, behold, [they were] in the midst H8432 of Samaria H8111.
006:021 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Elisha H0477, when he saw H7200 (8800) them, My father H0001, shall I smite H5221 (8686) [them]? shall I smite H5221 (8686) [them]?
006:022 And he answered H0559 (8799), Thou shalt not smite H5221 (8686) [them]: wouldest thou smite H5221 (8688) those whom thou hast taken captive H7617 (8804) with thy sword H2719 and with thy bow H7198? set H7760 (8798) bread H3899 and water H4325 before H6440 them, that they may eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and go H3212 (8799) to their master H0113.
006:023 And he prepared H3739 (8799) great H1419 provision H3740 for them: and when they had eaten H0398 (8799) and drunk H8354 (8799), he sent them away H7971 (8762), and they went H3212 (8799) to their master H0113. So the bands H1416 of Syria H0758 came H0935 (8800) no more H3254 (8804) into the land H0776 of Israel H3478.
006:024 And it came to pass after this H0310, that Benhadad H1130 king H4428 of Syria H0758 gathered H6908 (8799) all his host H4264, and went up H5927 (8799), and besieged H6696 (8799) Samaria H8111.
006:025 And there was a great H1419 famine H7458 in Samaria H8111: and, behold, they besieged H6696 (8802) it, until an ass’s H2543 head H7218 was [sold] for fourscore H8084 [pieces] of silver H3701, and the fourth part H7255 of a cab H6894 of dove’s dung H1686 (8675) H3123 H2755 for five H2568 [pieces] of silver H3701.
006:026 And as the king H4428 of Israel H3478 was passing by H5674 (8802) upon the wall H2346, there cried H6817 (8804) a woman H0802 unto him, saying H0559 (8800), Help H3467 (8685), my lord H0113, O king H4428.
006:027 And he said H0559 (8799), If the LORD H3068 do not help H3467 (8686) thee, whence H0370 shall I help H3467 (8686) thee? out of the barnfloor H1637, or out of the winepress H3342?
006:028 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered H0559 (8799), This woman H0802 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Give H5414 (8798) thy son H1121, that we may eat H0398 (8799) him to day H3117, and we will eat H0398 (8799) my son H1121 to morrow H4279.
006:029 So we boiled H1310 (8762) my son H1121, and did eat H0398 (8799) him: and I said H0559 (8799) unto her on the next H0312 day H3117, Give H5414 (8798) thy son H1121, that we may eat H0398 (8799) him: and she hath hid H2244 (8686) her son H1121.
006:030 And it came to pass, when the king H4428 heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of the woman H0802, that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899; and he passed by H5674 (8802) upon the wall H2346, and the people H5971 looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, [he had] sackcloth H8242 within H1004 upon his flesh H1320.
006:031 Then he said H0559 (8799), God H0430 do H6213 (8799) so and more H3254 (8686) also to me, if the head H7218 of Elisha H0477 the son H1121 of Shaphat H8202 shall stand H5975 (8799) on him this day H3117.
006:032 But Elisha H0477 sat H3427 (8802) in his house H1004, and the elders H2205 sat H3427 (8802) with him; and [the king] sent H7971 (8799) a man H0376 from before H6440 him: but ere the messenger H4397 came H0935 (8799) to him, he said H0559 (8804) to the elders H2205, See H7200 (8804) ye how this son H1121 of a murderer H7523 (8764) hath sent H7971 (8804) to take away H5493 (8687) mine head H7218? look H7200 (8798), when the messenger H4397 cometh H0935 (8800), shut H5462 (8798) the door H1817, and hold him fast H3905 (8804) at the door H1817: [is] not the sound H6963 of his master’s H0113 feet H7272 behind H0310 him?
006:033 And while he yet talked H1696 (8764) with them, behold, the messenger H4397 came down H3381 (8802) unto him: and he said H0559 (8799), Behold, this evil H7451 [is] of the LORD H3068; what should I wait H3176 (8686) for the LORD H3068 any longer?
007:001 ¶ Then Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, To morrow H4279 about this time H6256 [shall] a measure H5429 of fine flour H5560 [be sold] for a shekel H8255, and two measures H5429 of barley H8184 for a shekel H8255, in the gate H8179 of Samaria H8111.
007:002 Then a lord H7991 on whose hand H3027 the king H4428 leaned H8172 (8737) answered H6030 (8799) the man H0376 of God H0430, and said H0559 (8799), Behold, [if] the LORD H3068 would make H6213 (8802) windows H0699 in heaven H8064, might this thing H1697 be? And he said H0559 (8799), Behold, thou shalt see H7200 (8802) [it] with thine eyes H5869, but shalt not eat H0398 (8799) thereof.
007:003 And there were four H0702 leprous H6879 (8794) men H0582 at the entering in H6607 of the gate H8179: and they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, Why sit H3427 (8802) we here until we die H4191 (8804)?
007:004 If we say H0559 (8804), We will enter H0935 (8799) into the city H5892, then the famine H7458 [is] in the city H5892, and we shall die H4191 (8804) there: and if we sit still H3427 (8804) here, we die H4191 (8804) also. Now therefore come H3212 (8798), and let us fall H5307 (8799) unto the host H4264 of the Syrians H0758: if they save us alive H2421 (8762), we shall live H2421 (8799); and if they kill H4191 (8686) us, we shall but die H4191 (8804).
007:005 And they rose up H6965 (8799) in the twilight H5399, to go H0935 (8800) unto the camp H4264 of the Syrians H0758: and when they were come H0935 (8799) to the uttermost part H7097 of the camp H4264 of Syria H0758, behold, [there was] no man H0376 there.
007:006 For the Lord H0136 had made the host H4264 of the Syrians H0758 to hear H8085 (8689) a noise H6963 of chariots H7393, and a noise H6963 of horses H5483, [even] the noise H6963 of a great H1419 host H2428: and they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H0251, Lo, the king H4428 of Israel H3478 hath hired H7936 (8804) against us the kings H4428 of the Hittites H2850, and the kings H4428 of the Egyptians H4714, to come H0935 (8800) upon us.
007:007 Wherefore they arose H6965 (8799) and fled H5127 (8799) in the twilight H5399, and left H5800 (8799) their tents H0168, and their horses H5483, and their asses H2543, even the camp H4264 as it [was], and fled H5127 (8799) for their life H5315.
007:008 And when these lepers H6879 (8794) came H0935 (8799) to the uttermost part H7097 of the camp H4264, they went H0935 (8799) into one H0259 tent H0168, and did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and carried H5375 (8799) thence silver H3701, and gold H2091, and raiment H0899, and went H3212 (8799) and hid H2934 (8686) [it]; and came again H7725 (8799), and entered H0935 (8799) into another H0312 tent H0168, and carried H5375 (8799) thence [also], and went H3212 (8799) and hid H2934 (8686) [it].
007:009 Then they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H7453, We do H6213 (8802) not well: this day H3117 [is] a day H3117 of good tidings H1309, and we hold our peace H2814 (8688): if we tarry H2442 (8765) till the morning H1242 light H0216, some mischief H5771 will come H4672 (8804) upon us: now therefore come H3212 (8798), that we may go H0935 (8799) and tell H5046 (8686) the king’s H4428 household H1004.
007:010 So they came H0935 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) unto the porter H7778 of the city H5892: and they told H5046 (8686) them, saying H0559 (8800), We came H0935 (8804) to the camp H4264 of the Syrians H0758, and, behold, [there was] no man H0376 there, neither voice H6963 of man H0120, but horses H5483 tied H0631 (8803), and asses H2543 tied H0631 (8803), and the tents H0168 as they [were].
007:011 And he called H7121 (8799) the porters H7778; and they told H5046 (8686) [it] to the king’s H4428 house H1004 within H6441.
007:012 And the king H4428 arose H6965 (8799) in the night H3915, and said H0559 (8799) unto his servants H5650, I will now shew H5046 (8686) you what the Syrians H0758 have done H6213 (8804) to us. They know H3045 (8804) that we [be] hungry H7457; therefore are they gone out H3318 (8799) of the camp H4264 to hide H2247 (8736) themselves in the field H7704, saying H0559 (8800), When they come out H3318 (8799) of the city H5892, we shall catch H8610 (8799) them alive H2416, and get H0935 (8799) into the city H5892.
007:013 And one H0259 of his servants H5650 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Let [some] take H3947 (8799), I pray thee, five H2568 of the horses H5483 that remain H7604 (8737), which are left H7604 (8738) in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the multitude H1995 of Israel H3478 that are left H7604 (8738) in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude H1995 of the Israelites H3478 that are consumed H8552 (8804):) and let us send H7971 (8799) and see H7200 (8799).
007:014 They took H3947 (8799) therefore two H8147 chariot H7393 horses H5483; and the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) after H0310 the host H4264 of the Syrians H0758, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) and see H7200 (8798).
007:015 And they went H3212 (8799) after H0310 them unto Jordan H3383: and, lo, all the way H1870 [was] full H4392 of garments H0899 and vessels H3627, which the Syrians H0758 had cast away H7993 (8689) in their haste H2648 (8800). And the messengers H4397 returned H7725 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) the king H4428.
007:016 And the people H5971 went out H3318 (8799), and spoiled H0962 (8799) the tents H4264 of the Syrians H0758. So a measure H5429 of fine flour H5560 was [sold] for a shekel H8255, and two measures H5429 of barley H8184 for a shekel H8255, according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
007:017 And the king H4428 appointed H6485 (8689) the lord H7991 on whose hand H3027 he leaned H8172 (8737) to have the charge of the gate H8179: and the people H5971 trode H7429 (8799) upon him in the gate H8179, and he died H4191 (8799), as the man H0376 of God H0430 had said H1696 (8765), who spake H1696 (8765) when the king H4428 came down H3381 (8800) to him.
007:018 And it came to pass as the man H0376 of God H0430 had spoken H1696 (8763) to the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), Two measures H5429 of barley H8184 for a shekel H8255, and a measure H5429 of fine flour H5560 for a shekel H8255, shall be to morrow H4279 about this time H6256 in the gate H8179 of Samaria H8111:
007:019 And that lord H7991 answered H6030 (8799) the man H0376 of God H0430, and said H0559 (8799), Now, behold, [if] the LORD H3068 should make H6213 (8802) windows H0699 in heaven H8064, might such a thing H1697 be? And he said H0559 (8799), Behold, thou shalt see H7200 (8802) it with thine eyes H5869, but shalt not eat H0398 (8799) thereof.
007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people H5971 trode H7429 (8799) upon him in the gate H8179, and he died H4191 (8799).
008:001 ¶ Then spake H1696 (8765) Elisha H0477 unto the woman H0802, whose son H1121 he had restored to life H2421 (8689), saying H0559 (8800), Arise H6965 (8798), and go H3212 (8798) thou and thine household H1004, and sojourn H1481 (8798) wheresoever H0834 thou canst sojourn H1481 (8799): for the LORD H3068 hath called H7121 (8804) for a famine H7458; and it shall also come H0935 (8804) upon the land H0776 seven H7651 years H8141.
008:002 And the woman H0802 arose H6965 (8799), and did H6213 (8799) after the saying H1697 of the man H0376 of God H0430: and she went H3212 (8799) with her household H1004, and sojourned H1481 (8799) in the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430 seven H7651 years H8141.
008:003 And it came to pass at the seven H7651 years H8141 ’ end H7097, that the woman H0802 returned H7725 (8799) out of the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430: and she went forth H3318 (8799) to cry H6817 (8800) unto the king H4428 for her house H1004 and for her land H7704.
008:004 And the king H4428 talked H1696 (8764) with Gehazi H1522 the servant H5288 of the man H0376 of God H0430, saying H0559 (8800), Tell H5608 (8761) me, I pray thee, all the great things H1419 that Elisha H0477 hath done H6213 (8804).
008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling H5608 (8764) the king H4428 how he had restored H2421 a dead body H4191 (8801) to life H2421 (8689), that, behold, the woman H0802, whose son H1121 he had restored to life H2421 (8689), cried H6817 (8802) to the king H4428 for her house H1004 and for her land H7704. And Gehazi H1522 said H0559 (8799), My lord H0113, O king H4428, this [is] the woman H0802, and this [is] her son H1121, whom Elisha H0477 restored to life H2421 (8689).
008:006 And when the king H4428 asked H7592 (8799) the woman H0802, she told H5608 (8762) him. So the king H4428 appointed H5414 (8799) unto her a certain H0259 officer H5631, saying H0559 (8800), Restore H7725 (8685) all that [was] hers, and all the fruits H8393 of the field H7704 since the day H3117 that she left H5800 (8800) the land H0776, even until now.
008:007 And Elisha H0477 came H0935 (8799) to Damascus H1834; and Benhadad H1130 the king H4428 of Syria H0758 was sick H2470 (8802); and it was told H5046 (8714) him, saying H0559 (8800), The man H0376 of God H0430 is come H0935 (8804) hither H2008.
008:008 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Hazael H2371, Take H3947 (8798) a present H4503 in thine hand H3027, and go H3212 (8798), meet H7125 (8800) the man H0376 of God H0430, and enquire H1875 (8804) of the LORD H3068 by him, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I recover H2421 (8799) of this disease H2483?
008:009 So Hazael H2371 went H3212 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him, and took H3947 (8799) a present H4503 with him H3027, even of every good thing H2898 of Damascus H1834, forty H0705 camels H1581 ’ burden H4853, and came H0935 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 him, and said H0559 (8799), Thy son H1121 Benhadad H1130 king H4428 of Syria H0758 hath sent H7971 (8804) me to thee, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I recover H2421 (8799) of this disease H2483?
008:010 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go H3212 (8798), say H0559 (8798) unto him, Thou mayest certainly H2421 (8800) recover H2421 (8799): howbeit the LORD H3068 hath shewed H7200 (8689) me that he shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
008:011 And he settled H5975 (8686) his countenance H6440 stedfastly H7760 (8799), until he was ashamed H0954 (8800): and the man H0376 of God H0430 wept H1058 (8799).
008:012 And Hazael H2371 said H0559 (8799), Why weepeth H1058 (8802) my lord H0113? And he answered H0559 (8799), Because I know H3045 (8804) the evil H7451 that thou wilt do H6213 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478: their strong holds H4013 wilt thou set H7971 (8762) on fire H0784, and their young men H0970 wilt thou slay H2026 (8799) with the sword H2719, and wilt dash H7376 (8762) their children H5768, and rip up H1234 (8762) their women with child H2030.
008:013 And Hazael H2371 said H0559 (8799), But what, [is] thy servant H5650 a dog H3611, that he should do H6213 (8799) this great H1419 thing H1697? And Elisha H0477 answered H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 hath shewed H7200 (8689) me that thou [shalt be] king H4428 over Syria H0758.
008:014 So he departed H3212 (8799) from Elisha H0477, and came H0935 (8799) to his master H0113; who said H0559 (8799) to him, What said H0559 (8804) Elisha H0477 to thee? And he answered H0559 (8799), He told H0559 (8804) me [that] thou shouldest surely H2421 (8800) recover H2421 (8799).
008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that he took H3947 (8799) a thick cloth H4346, and dipped H2881 (8799) [it] in water H4325, and spread H6566 (8799) [it] on his face H6440, so that he died H4191 (8799): and Hazael H2371 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
008:016 And in the fifth H2568 year H8141 of Joram H3141 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478, Jehoshaphat H3092 [being] then king H4428 of Judah H3063, Jehoram H3088 the son H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began to reign H4427 (8804).
008:017 Thirty H7970 and two H8147 years H8141 old H1121 was he when he began to reign H4427 (8800); and he reigned H4427 (8804) eight H8083 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389.
008:018 And he walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, as did H6213 (8804) the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for the daughter H1323 of Ahab H0256 was his wife H0802: and he did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
008:019 Yet the LORD H3068 would H0014 (8804) not destroy H7843 (8687) Judah H3063 for David H1732 his servant’s H5650 sake, as he promised H0559 (8804) him to give H5414 (8800) him alway H3117 a light H5216, [and] to his children H1121.
008:020 In his days H3117 Edom H0123 revolted H6586 (8804) from under the hand H3027 of Judah H3063, and made H4427 (8686) a king H4428 over themselves.
008:021 So Joram H3141 went over H5674 (8799) to Zair H6811, and all the chariots H7393 with him: and he rose H6965 (8804) by night H3915, and smote H5221 (8686) the Edomites H0123 which compassed him about H5437 (8802), and the captains H8269 of the chariots H7393: and the people H5971 fled H5127 (8799) into their tents H0168.
008:022 Yet Edom H0123 revolted H6586 (8799) from under the hand H3027 of Judah H3063 unto this day H3117. Then Libnah H3841 revolted H6586 (8799) at the same H1931 time H6256.
008:023 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Joram H3141, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
008:024 And Joram H3141 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Ahaziah H0274 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
008:025 In the twelfth H8147 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Joram H3141 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478 did Ahaziah H0274 the son H1121 of Jehoram H3088 king H4428 of Judah H3063 begin to reign H4427 (8804).
008:026 Two H8147 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 [was] Ahaziah H0274 when he began to reign H4427 (8800); and he reigned H4427 (8804) one H0259 year H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Athaliah H6271, the daughter H1323 of Omri H6018 king H4428 of Israel H3478.
008:027 And he walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256, and did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, as [did] the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for he [was] the son in law H2860 of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256.
008:028 And he went H3212 (8799) with Joram H3141 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 to the war H4421 against Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758 in Ramothgilead H7433 H1568; and the Syrians H0761 wounded H5221 (8686) Joram H3141.
008:029 And king H4428 Joram H3141 went back H7725 (8799) to be healed H7495 (8692) in Jezreel H3157 of the wounds H4347 which the Syrians H0761 had given H5221 (8686) him at Ramah H7414, when he fought H3898 (8736) against Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758. And Ahaziah H0274 the son H1121 of Jehoram H3088 king H4428 of Judah H3063 went down H3381 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) Joram H3141 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 in Jezreel H3157, because he was sick H2470 (8802).
009:001 ¶ And Elisha H0477 the prophet H5030 called H7121 (8804) one H0259 of the children H1121 of the prophets H5030, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Gird up H2296 (8798) thy loins H4975, and take H3947 (8798) this box H6378 of oil H8081 in thine hand H3027, and go H3212 (8798) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568:
009:002 And when thou comest H0935 (8804) thither, look out H7200 (8798) there Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092 the son H1121 of Nimshi H5250, and go in H0935 (8804), and make him arise up H6965 (8689) from among H8432 his brethren H0251, and carry H0935 (8689) him to an inner H2315 chamber H2315;
009:003 Then take H3947 (8804) the box H6378 of oil H8081, and pour H3332 (8804) [it] on his head H7218, and say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, I have anointed H4886 (8804) thee king H4428 over Israel H3478. Then open H6605 (8804) the door H1817, and flee H5127 (8804), and tarry H2442 (8762) not.
009:004 So the young man H5288, [even] the young man H5288 the prophet H5030, went H3212 (8799) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568.
009:005 And when he came H0935 (8799), behold, the captains H8269 of the host H2428 [were] sitting H3427 (8802); and he said H0559 (8799), I have an errand H1697 to thee, O captain H8269. And Jehu H3058 said H0559 (8799), Unto which of all us? And he said H0559 (8799), To thee, O captain H8269.
009:006 And he arose H6965 (8799), and went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004; and he poured H3332 (8799) the oil H8081 on his head H7218, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, I have anointed H4886 (8804) thee king H4428 over the people H5971 of the LORD H3068, [even] over Israel H3478.
009:007 And thou shalt smite H5221 (8689) the house H1004 of Ahab H0256 thy master H0113, that I may avenge H5358 (8765) the blood H1818 of my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, and the blood H1818 of all the servants H5650 of the LORD H3068, at the hand H3027 of Jezebel H0348.
009:008 For the whole house H1004 of Ahab H0256 shall perish H0006 (8804): and I will cut off H3772 (8689) from Ahab H0256 him that pisseth H8366 (8688) against the wall H7023, and him that is shut up H6113 (8803) and left H5800 (8803) in Israel H3478:
009:009 And I will make H5414 (8804) the house H1004 of Ahab H0256 like the house H1004 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, and like the house H1004 of Baasha H1201 the son H1121 of Ahijah H0281:
009:010 And the dogs H3611 shall eat H0398 (8799) Jezebel H0348 in the portion H2506 of Jezreel H3157, and [there shall be] none to bury H6912 (8802) [her]. And he opened H6605 (8799) the door H1817, and fled H5127 (8799).
009:011 Then Jehu H3058 came forth H3318 (8804) to the servants H5650 of his lord H0113: and [one] said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Is] all well H7965? wherefore came H0935 (8804) this mad H7696 (8794) [fellow] to thee? And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye know H3045 (8804) the man H0376, and his communication H7879.
009:012 And they said H0559 (8799), [It is] false H8267; tell H5046 (8685) us now. And he said H0559 (8799), Thus and thus spake H0559 (8804) he to me, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, I have anointed H4886 (8804) thee king H4428 over Israel H3478.
009:013 Then they hasted H4116 (8762), and took H3947 (8799) every man H0376 his garment H0899, and put H7760 (8799) [it] under him on the top H1634 of the stairs H4609, and blew H8628 (8799) with trumpets H7782, saying H0559 (8799), Jehu H3058 is king H4427 (8804).
009:014 So Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092 the son H1121 of Nimshi H5250 conspired H7194 (8691) against Joram H3141. (Now Joram H3141 had kept H8104 (8802) Ramothgilead H7433 H1568, he and all Israel H3478, because H6440 of Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758.
009:015 But king H4428 Joram H3088 was returned H7725 (8799) to be healed H7495 (8692) in Jezreel H3157 of the wounds H4347 which the Syrians H0761 had given H5221 (8686) him, when he fought H3898 (8736) with Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758.) And Jehu H3058 said H0559 (8799), If it be H3426 your minds H5315, [then] let none H0408 go forth H3318 (8799) [nor] escape H6412 out of the city H5892 to go H3212 (8800) to tell H5046 (8687) [it] in Jezreel H3157.
009:016 So Jehu H3058 rode in a chariot H7392 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) to Jezreel H3157; for Joram H3141 lay H7901 (8802) there. And Ahaziah H0274 king H4428 of Judah H3063 was come down H3381 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) Joram H3141.
009:017 And there stood H5975 (8802) a watchman H6822 (8802) on the tower H4026 in Jezreel H3157, and he spied H7200 (8799) the company H8229 of Jehu H3058 as he came H0935 (8800), and said H0559 (8799), I see H7200 (8802) a company H8229. And Joram H3088 said H0559 (8799), Take H3947 (8798) an horseman H7395, and send H7971 (8798) to meet H7125 (8800) them, and let him say H0559 (8799), [Is it] peace H7965?
009:018 So there went H3212 (8799) one on horseback H7392 (8802) H5483 to meet H7125 (8800) him, and said H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428, [Is it] peace H7965? And Jehu H3058 said H0559 (8799), What hast thou to do with peace H7965? turn H5437 (8798) thee behind H0310 me. And the watchman H6822 (8802) told H5046 (8686), saying H0559 (8800), The messenger H4397 came H0935 (8804) to them, but he cometh not again H7725 (8804).
009:019 Then he sent out H7971 (8799) a second H8145 on horseback H7392 (8802) H5483, which came H0935 (8799) to them, and said H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428, [Is it] peace H7965? And Jehu H3058 answered H0559 (8799), What hast thou to do with peace H7965? turn H5437 (8798) thee behind H0310 me.
009:020 And the watchman H6822 (8802) told H5046 (8686), saying H0559 (8800), He came H0935 (8804) even unto them, and cometh not again H7725 (8804): and the driving H4491 [is] like the driving H4491 of Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Nimshi H5250; for he driveth H5090 (8799) furiously H7697.
009:021 And Joram H3088 said H0559 (8799), Make ready H0631 (8798). And his chariot H7393 was made ready H0631 (8799). And Joram H3088 king H4428 of Israel H3478 and Ahaziah H0274 king H4428 of Judah H3063 went out H3318 (8799), each H0376 in his chariot H7393, and they went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) Jehu H3058, and met H4672 (8799) him in the portion H2513 of Naboth H5022 the Jezreelite H3158.
009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram H3088 saw H7200 (8800) Jehu H3058, that he said H0559 (8799), [Is it] peace H7965, Jehu H3058? And he answered H0559 (8799), What peace H7965, so long as H5704 the whoredoms H2183 of thy mother H0517 Jezebel H0348 and her witchcrafts H3785 [are so] many H7227?
009:023 And Joram H3088 turned H2015 (8799) his hands H3027, and fled H5127 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) to Ahaziah H0274, [There is] treachery H4820, O Ahaziah H0274.
009:024 And Jehu H3058 drew a bow H7198 with his full H4390 (8765) strength H3027, and smote H5221 (8686) Jehoram H3088 between his arms H2220, and the arrow H2678 went out H3318 (8799) at his heart H3820, and he sunk down H3766 (8799) in his chariot H7393.
009:025 Then said H0559 (8799) [Jehu] to Bidkar H0920 his captain H7991, Take up H5375 (8798), [and] cast H7993 (8685) him in the portion H2513 of the field H7704 of Naboth H5022 the Jezreelite H3158: for remember H2142 (8798) how that, when I and thou rode H7392 (8802) together H6776 after H0310 Ahab H0256 his father H0001, the LORD H3068 laid H5375 (8804) this burden H4853 upon him;
009:026 Surely I have seen H7200 (8804) yesterday H0570 the blood H1818 of Naboth H5022, and the blood H1818 of his sons H1121, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and I will requite H7999 (8765) thee in this plat H2513, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068. Now therefore take H5375 (8798) [and] cast H7993 (8685) him into the plat H2513 [of ground], according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
009:027 But when Ahaziah H0274 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 saw H7200 (8804) [this], he fled H5127 (8799) by the way H1870 of the garden H1588 house H1004. And Jehu H3058 followed H7291 (8799) after H0310 him, and said H0559 (8799), Smite H5221 (8685) him also in the chariot H4818. [And they did so] at the going up H4608 to Gur H1483, which [is] by Ibleam H2991. And he fled H5127 (8799) to Megiddo H4023, and died H4191 (8799) there.
009:028 And his servants H5650 carried H7392 (8686) him in a chariot to Jerusalem H3389, and buried H6912 (8799) him in his sepulchre H6900 with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732.
009:029 And in the eleventh H0259 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Joram H3141 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 began Ahaziah H0274 to reign H4427 (8804) over Judah H3063.
009:030 And when Jehu H3058 was come H0935 (8799) to Jezreel H3157, Jezebel H0348 heard H8085 (8804) [of it]; and she painted H7760 (8799) H6320 her face H5869, and tired H3190 (8686) her head H7218, and looked out H8259 (8686) at a window H2474.
009:031 And as Jehu H3058 entered in H0935 (8804) at the gate H8179, she said H0559 (8799), [Had] Zimri H2174 peace H7965, who slew H2026 (8802) his master H0113?
009:032 And he lifted up H5375 (8799) his face H6440 to the window H2474, and said H0559 (8799), Who [is] on my side? who? And there looked out H8259 (8686) to him two H8147 [or] three H7969 eunuchs H5631.
009:033 And he said H0559 (8799), Throw her down H8058 (8798). So they threw her down H8058 (8799): and [some] of her blood H1818 was sprinkled H5137 (8799) on the wall H7023, and on the horses H5483: and he trode her under foot H7429 (8799).
009:034 And when he was come in H0935 (8799), he did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Go H6485 (8798), see now this cursed H0779 (8803) [woman], and bury H6912 (8798) her: for she [is] a king’s H4428 daughter H1323.
009:035 And they went H3212 (8799) to bury H6912 (8800) her: but they found H4672 (8804) no more of her than H0518 the skull H1538, and the feet H7272, and the palms H3709 of [her] hands H3027.
009:036 Wherefore they came again H7725 (8799), and told H5046 (8686) him. And he said H0559 (8799), This [is] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he spake H1696 (8765) by H3027 his servant H5650 Elijah H0452 the Tishbite H8664, saying H0559 (8800), In the portion H2506 of Jezreel H3157 shall dogs H3611 eat H0398 (8799) the flesh H1320 of Jezebel H0348:
009:037 And the carcase H5038 of Jezebel H0348 shall be as dung H1828 upon the face H6440 of the field H7704 in the portion H2506 of Jezreel H3157; [so] that they shall not say H0559 (8799), This [is] Jezebel H0348.
010:001 ¶ And Ahab H0256 had seventy H7657 sons H1121 in Samaria H8111. And Jehu H3058 wrote H3789 (8799) letters H5612, and sent H7971 (8799) to Samaria H8111, unto the rulers H8269 of Jezreel H3157, to the elders H2205, and to them that brought up H0539 (8802) Ahab’s H0256 [children], saying H0559 (8800),
010:002 Now as soon as this letter H5612 cometh H0935 (8800) to you, seeing your master’s H0113 sons H1121 [are] with you, and [there are] with you chariots H7393 and horses H5483, a fenced H4013 city H5892 also, and armour H5402;
010:003 Look even out H7200 (8804) the best H2896 and meetest H3477 of your master’s H0113 sons H1121, and set H7760 (8804) [him] on his father’s H0001 throne H3678, and fight H3898 (8734) for your master’s H0113 house H1004.
010:004 But they were exceedingly H3966 H3966 afraid H3372 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Behold, two H8147 kings H4428 stood H5975 (8804) not before H6440 him: how then shall we stand H5975 (8799)?
010:005 And he that [was] over the house H1004, and he that [was] over the city H5892, the elders H2205 also, and the bringers up H0539 (8802) [of the children], sent H7971 (8799) to Jehu H3058, saying H0559 (8800), We [are] thy servants H5650, and will do H6213 (8799) all that thou shalt bid H0559 (8799) us; we will not make any H0376 king H4427 (8686): do H6213 (8798) thou [that which is] good H2896 in thine eyes H5869.
010:006 Then he wrote H3789 (8799) a letter H5612 the second time H8145 to them, saying H0559 (8800), If ye [be] mine, and [if] ye will hearken H8085 (8802) unto my voice H6963, take H3947 (8798) ye the heads H7218 of the men H0582 your master’s H0113 sons H1121, and come H0935 (8798) to me to Jezreel H3157 by to morrow H4279 this time H6256. Now the king’s H4428 sons H1121, [being] seventy H7657 persons H0376, [were] with the great men H1419 of the city H5892, which brought them up H1431 (8764).
010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter H5612 came H0935 (8800) to them, that they took H3947 (8799) the king’s H4428 sons H1121, and slew H7819 (8799) seventy H7657 persons H0376, and put H7760 (8799) their heads H7218 in baskets H1731, and sent H7971 (8799) him [them] to Jezreel H3157.
010:008 And there came H0935 (8799) a messenger H4397, and told H5046 (8686) him, saying H0559 (8800), They have brought H0935 (8689) the heads H7218 of the king’s H4428 sons H1121. And he said H0559 (8799), Lay H7760 (8798) ye them in two H8147 heaps H6652 at the entering in H6607 of the gate H8179 until the morning H1242.
010:009 And it came to pass in the morning H1242, that he went out H3318 (8799), and stood H5975 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) to all the people H5971, Ye [be] righteous H6662: behold, I conspired H7194 (8804) against my master H0113, and slew H2026 (8799) him: but who slew H5221 (8689) all these?
010:010 Know H3045 (8798) now H0645 that there shall fall H5307 (8799) unto the earth H0776 nothing of the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, which the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) concerning the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for the LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8804) [that] which he spake H1696 (8765) by H3027 his servant H5650 Elijah H0452.
010:011 So Jehu H3058 slew H5221 (8686) all that remained H7604 (8737) of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256 in Jezreel H3157, and all his great men H1419, and his kinsfolks H3045 (8794), and his priests H3548, until he left H7604 (8689) him none remaining H8300.
010:012 And he arose H6965 (8799) and departed H0935 (8799), and came H3212 (8799) to Samaria H8111. [And] as he [was] at the shearing H7462 (8802) house H1004 (8677) H1044 in the way H1870,
010:013 Jehu H3058 met H4672 (8804) with the brethren H0251 of Ahaziah H0274 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and said H0559 (8799), Who [are] ye? And they answered H0559 (8799), We [are] the brethren H0251 of Ahaziah H0274; and we go down H3381 (8799) to salute H7965 the children H1121 of the king H4428 and the children H1121 of the queen H1377.
010:014 And he said H0559 (8799), Take H8610 (8798) them alive H2416. And they took H8610 (8799) them alive H2416, and slew H7819 (8799) them at the pit H0953 of the shearing house H1044, [even] two H8147 and forty H0705 men H0376; neither left H7604 (8689) he any H0376 of them.
010:015 And when he was departed H3212 (8799) thence, he lighted H4672 (8799) on Jehonadab H3082 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394 [coming] to meet H7125 (8800) him: and he saluted H1288 (8762) him, and said H0559 (8799) to him, Is H3426 thine heart H3824 right H3477, as my heart H3824 [is] with thy heart H3824? And Jehonadab H3082 answered H0559 (8799), It is H3426. If it be, give H5414 (8798) [me] thine hand H3027. And he gave H5414 (8799) [him] his hand H3027; and he took him up H5927 (8686) to him into the chariot H4818.
010:016 And he said H0559 (8799), Come H3212 (8798) with me, and see H7200 (8798) my zeal H7068 for the LORD H3068. So they made him ride H7392 (8686) in his chariot H7393.
010:017 And when he came H0935 (8799) to Samaria H8111, he slew H5221 (8686) all that remained H7604 (8737) unto Ahab H0256 in Samaria H8111, till he had destroyed H8045 (8689) him, according to the saying H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he spake H1696 (8765) to Elijah H0452.
010:018 And Jehu H3058 gathered H6908 all the people H5971 together H6908 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ahab H0256 served H5647 (8804) Baal H1168 a little H4592; [but] Jehu H3058 shall serve H5647 (8799) him much H7235 (8687).
010:019 Now therefore call H7121 (8798) unto me all the prophets H5030 of Baal H1168, all his servants H5647 (8802), and all his priests H3548; let none H0376 be wanting H6485 (8735): for I have a great H1419 sacrifice H2077 [to do] to Baal H1168; whosoever shall be wanting H6485 (8735), he shall not live H2421 (8799). But Jehu H3058 did H6213 (8804) [it] in subtilty H6122, to the intent that he might destroy H0006 (8687) the worshippers H5647 (8802) of Baal H1168.
010:020 And Jehu H3058 said H0559 (8799), Proclaim H6942 (8761) a solemn assembly H6116 for Baal H1168. And they proclaimed H7121 (8799) [it].
010:021 And Jehu H3058 sent H7971 (8799) through all Israel H3478: and all the worshippers H5647 (8802) of Baal H1168 came H0935 (8799), so that there was not a man H0376 left H7604 (8738) that came H0935 (8804) not. And they came H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of Baal H1168; and the house H1004 of Baal H1168 was full H4390 (8735) from one end H6310 to another H6310.
010:022 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him that [was] over the vestry H4458, Bring forth H3318 (8685) vestments H3830 for all the worshippers H5647 (8802) of Baal H1168. And he brought them forth H3318 (8686) vestments H4403.
010:023 And Jehu H3058 went H0935 (8799), and Jehonadab H3082 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394, into the house H1004 of Baal H1168, and said H0559 (8799) unto the worshippers H5647 (8802) of Baal H1168, Search H2664 (8761), and look H7200 (8798) that there be H3426 here with you none of the servants H5650 of the LORD H3068, but the worshippers H5647 (8802) of Baal H1168 only.
010:024 And when they went in H0935 (8799) to offer H6213 (8800) sacrifices H2077 and burnt offerings H5930, Jehu H3058 appointed H7760 (8804) fourscore H8084 men H0376 without H2351, and said H0559 (8799), [If] any H0376 of the men H0582 whom I have brought H0935 (8688) into your hands H3027 escape H4422 (8735), [he that letteth him go], his life H5315 [shall be] for the life H5315 of him.
010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end H3615 (8763) of offering H6213 (8800) the burnt offering H5930, that Jehu H3058 said H0559 (8799) to the guard H7323 (8801) and to the captains H7991, Go in H0935 (8798), [and] slay H5221 (8685) them; let none H0376 come forth H3318 (8799). And they smote H5221 (8686) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; and the guard H7323 (8801) and the captains H7991 cast [them] out H7993 (8686), and went H3212 (8799) to the city H5892 of the house H1004 of Baal H1168.
010:026 And they brought forth H3318 (8686) the images H4676 out of the house H1004 of Baal H1168, and burned H8313 (8799) them.
010:027 And they brake down H5422 (8799) the image H4676 of Baal H1168, and brake down H5422 (8799) the house H1004 of Baal H1168, and made H7760 (8799) it a draught house H4163 (8675) H4280 unto this day H3117.
010:028 Thus Jehu H3058 destroyed H8045 (8686) Baal H1168 out of Israel H3478.
010:029 Howbeit [from] the sins H2399 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689), Jehu H3058 departed H5493 (8804) not from after H0310 them, [to wit], the golden H2091 calves H5695 that [were] in Bethel H1008, and that [were] in Dan H1835.
010:030 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Jehu H3058, Because thou hast done well H2895 (8689) in executing H6213 (8800) [that which is] right H3477 in mine eyes H5869, [and] hast done H6213 (8804) unto the house H1004 of Ahab H0256 according to all that [was] in mine heart H3824, thy children H1121 of the fourth H7243 [generation] shall sit H3427 (8799) on the throne H3678 of Israel H3478.
010:031 But Jehu H3058 took no heed H8104 (8804) to walk H3212 (8800) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 with all his heart H3824: for he departed H5493 (8804) not from the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379, which made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
010:032 In those days H3117 the LORD H3068 began H2490 (8689) to cut H7096 Israel H3478 short H7096 (8763): and Hazael H2371 smote H5221 (8686) them in all the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478;
010:033 From Jordan H3383 eastward H4217 H8121, all the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, the Gadites H1425, and the Reubenites H7206, and the Manassites H4520, from Aroer H6177, which [is] by the river H5158 Arnon H0769, even Gilead H1568 and Bashan H1316.
010:034 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehu H3058, and all that he did H6213 (8804), and all his might H1369, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
010:035 And Jehu H3058 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001: and they buried H6912 (8799) him in Samaria H8111. And Jehoahaz H3059 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
010:036 And the time H3117 that Jehu H3058 reigned H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111 [was] twenty H6242 and eight H8083 years H8141.
011:001 ¶ And when Athaliah H6271 the mother H0517 of Ahaziah H0274 saw H7200 (8804) that her son H1121 was dead H4191 (8804), she arose H6965 (8799) and destroyed H0006 (8762) all the seed H2233 royal H4467.
011:002 But Jehosheba H3089, the daughter H1323 of king H4428 Joram H3141, sister H0269 of Ahaziah H0274, took H3947 (8799) Joash H3101 the son H1121 of Ahaziah H0274, and stole H1589 (8799) him from among H8432 the king’s H4428 sons H1121 [which were] slain H4191 (8716); and they hid H5641 (8686) him, [even] him and his nurse H3243 (8688), in the bedchamber H2315 H4296 from H6440 Athaliah H6271, so that he was not slain H4191 (8717).
011:003 And he was with her hid H2244 (8693) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 six H8337 years H8141. And Athaliah H6271 did reign H4427 (8802) over the land H0776.
011:004 And the seventh H7637 year H8141 Jehoiada H3077 sent H7971 (8804) and fetched H3947 (8799) the rulers H8269 over hundreds H3967, with the captains H3746 and the guard H7323 (8801), and brought H0935 (8686) them to him into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with them, and took an oath H7650 (8686) of them in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and shewed H7200 (8686) them the king’s H4428 son H1121.
011:005 And he commanded H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), This [is] the thing H1697 that ye shall do H6213 (8799); A third part H7992 of you that enter in H0935 (8802) on the sabbath H7676 shall even be keepers H8104 (8802) of the watch H4931 of the king’s H4428 house H1004;
011:006 And a third part H7992 [shall be] at the gate H8179 of Sur H5495; and a third part H7992 at the gate H8179 behind H0310 the guard H7323 (8801): so shall ye keep H8104 (8804) the watch H4931 of the house H1004, that it be not broken down H4535.
011:007 And two H8147 parts H3027 of all you that go forth H3318 (8802) on the sabbath H7676, even they shall keep H8104 (8804) the watch H4931 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 about H0413 the king H4428.
011:008 And ye shall compass H5362 (8689) the king H4428 round about H5439, every man H0376 with his weapons H3627 in his hand H3027: and he that cometh H0935 (8802) within the ranges H7713, let him be slain H4191 (8714): and be ye with the king H4428 as he goeth out H3318 (8800) and as he cometh in H0935 (8800).
011:009 And the captains H8269 over the hundreds H3967 did H6213 (8799) according to all [things] that Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 commanded H6680 (8765): and they took H3947 (8799) every man H0376 his men H0582 that were to come in H0935 (8802) on the sabbath H7676, with them that should go out H3318 (8802) on the sabbath H7676, and came H0935 (8799) to Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548.
011:010 And to the captains H8269 over hundreds H3967 did the priest H3548 give H5414 (8799) king H4428 David’s H1732 spears H2595 and shields H7982, that [were] in the temple H1004 of the LORD H3068.
011:011 And the guard H7323 (8801) stood H5975 (8799), every man H0376 with his weapons H3627 in his hand H3027, round about H5439 the king H4428, from the right H3233 corner H3802 of the temple H1004 to the left H8042 corner H3802 of the temple H1004, [along] by the altar H4196 and the temple H1004.
011:012 And he brought forth H3318 (8686) the king’s H4428 son H1121, and put H5414 (8799) the crown H5145 upon him, and [gave him] the testimony H5715; and they made him king H4427 (8686), and anointed H4886 (8799) him; and they clapped H5221 (8686) their hands H3709, and said H0559 (8799), God save H2421 (8799) the king H4428.
011:013 And when Athaliah H6271 heard H8085 (8799) the noise H6963 of the guard H7323 (8801) [and] of the people H5971, she came H0935 (8799) to the people H5971 into the temple H1004 of the LORD H3068.
011:014 And when she looked H7200 (8799), behold, the king H4428 stood H5975 (8802) by a pillar H5982, as the manner H4941 [was], and the princes H8269 and the trumpeters H2689 by the king H4428, and all the people H5971 of the land H0776 rejoiced H8056, and blew H8628 (8802) with trumpets H2689: and Athaliah H6271 rent H7167 (8799) her clothes H0899, and cried H7121 (8799), Treason H7195, Treason H7195.
011:015 But Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 commanded H6680 (8762) the captains H8269 of the hundreds H3967, the officers H6485 (8803) of the host H2428, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Have her forth H3318 (8685) without H1004 the ranges H7713: and him that followeth H0935 (8802) H0310 her kill H4191 (8687) with the sword H2719. For the priest H3548 had said H0559 (8804), Let her not be slain H4191 (8714) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
011:016 And they laid H7760 (8799) hands H3027 on her; and she went H0935 (8799) by the way H1870 by the which the horses H5483 came H3996 into the king’s H4428 house H1004: and there was she slain H4191 (8714).
011:017 And Jehoiada H3077 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 between the LORD H3068 and the king H4428 and the people H5971, that they should be the LORD’S H3068 people H5971; between the king H4428 also and the people H5971.
011:018 And all the people H5971 of the land H0776 went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of Baal H1168, and brake it down H5422 (8799); his altars H4196 and his images H6754 brake they in pieces H7665 (8765) thoroughly H3190 (8687), and slew H2026 (8804) Mattan H4977 the priest H3548 of Baal H1168 before H6440 the altars H4196. And the priest H3548 appointed H7760 (8799) officers H6485 (8803) (8676) H6486 over the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
011:019 And he took H3947 (8799) the rulers H8269 over hundreds H3967, and the captains H3746, and the guard H7323 (8801), and all the people H5971 of the land H0776; and they brought down H3381 (8686) the king H4428 from the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and came H0935 (8799) by the way H1870 of the gate H8179 of the guard H7323 (8801) to the king’s H4428 house H1004. And he sat H3427 (8799) on the throne H3678 of the kings H4428.
011:020 And all the people H5971 of the land H0776 rejoiced H8055 (8799), and the city H5892 was in quiet H8252 (8804): and they slew H4191 (8689) Athaliah H6271 with the sword H2719 [beside] the king’s H4428 house H1004.
011:021 Seven H7651 years H8141 old H1121 [was] Jehoash H3060 when he began to reign H4427 (8800).
012:001 ¶ In the seventh H7651 year H8141 of Jehu H3058 Jehoash H3060 began to reign H4427 (8804); and forty H0705 years H8141 reigned H4427 (8804) he in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Zibiah H6645 of Beersheba H0884.
012:002 And Jehoash H3060 did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 all his days H3117 wherein Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 instructed H3384 (8689) him.
012:003 But the high places H1116 were not taken away H5493 (8804): the people H5971 still sacrificed H2076 (8764) and burnt incense H6999 (8764) in the high places H1116.
012:004 And Jehoash H3060 said H0559 (8799) to the priests H3548, All the money H3701 of the dedicated things H6944 that is brought H0935 (8714) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, [even] the money H3701 of every one H0376 that passeth H5674 (8802) [the account], the money H3701 that every man H5315 is set at H6187, [and] all the money H3701 that cometh H5927 (8799) into any man’s H0376 heart H3820 to bring H0935 (8687) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068,
012:005 Let the priests H3548 take H3947 (8799) [it] to them, every man H0376 of his acquaintance H4378: and let them repair H2388 (8762) the breaches H0919 of the house H1004, wheresoever any breach H0919 shall be found H4672 (8735).
012:006 But it was [so, that] in the three H7969 H8141 and twentieth H6242 year H8141 of king H4428 Jehoash H3060 the priests H3548 had not repaired H2388 (8765) the breaches H0919 of the house H1004.
012:007 Then king H4428 Jehoash H3060 called H7121 (8799) for Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548, and the [other] priests H3548, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Why repair H2388 (8764) ye not the breaches H0919 of the house H1004? now therefore receive H3947 (8799) no [more] money H3701 of your acquaintance H4378, but deliver H5414 (8799) it for the breaches H0919 of the house H1004.
012:008 And the priests H3548 consented H0225 (8735) to receive H3947 (8800) no H1115 [more] money H3701 of the people H5971, neither H1115 to repair H2388 (8763) the breaches H0919 of the house H1004.
012:009 But Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 took H3947 (8799) a H0259 chest H0727, and bored H5344 (8799) a hole H2356 in the lid H1817 of it, and set H5414 (8799) it beside H0681 the altar H4196, on the right side H3225 as one H0376 cometh H0935 (8800) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and the priests H3548 that kept H8104 (8802) the door H5592 put H5414 (8804) therein all the money H3701 [that was] brought H0935 (8716) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
012:010 And it was [so], when they saw H7200 (8800) that [there was] much H7227 money H3701 in the chest H0727, that the king’s H4428 scribe H5608 (8802) and the high H1419 priest H3548 came up H5927 (8799), and they put up in bags H6696 (8799), and told H4487 (8799) the money H3701 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
012:011 And they gave H5414 (8804) the money H3701, being told H8505 (8794), into the hands H3027 of them that did H6213 (8802) the work H4399, that had the oversight H6485 (8716) (8675) H6485 (8803) of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and they laid it out H3318 (8686) to the carpenters H2796 H6086 and builders H1129 (8802), that wrought H6213 (8802) upon the house H1004 of the LORD H3068,
012:012 And to masons H1443 (8802), and hewers H2672 (8802) of stone H0068, and to buy H7069 (8800) timber H6086 and hewed H4274 stone H0068 to repair H2388 (8763) the breaches H0919 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and for all that was laid out H3318 (8799) for the house H1004 to repair H2394 [it].
012:013 Howbeit there were not made H6213 (8735) for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 bowls H5592 of silver H3701, snuffers H4212, basons H4219, trumpets H2689, any vessels H3627 of gold H2091, or vessels H3627 of silver H3701, of the money H3701 [that was] brought H0935 (8716) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068:
012:014 But they gave H5414 (8799) that to the workmen H4399 H6213 (8802), and repaired H2388 (8765) therewith the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
012:015 Moreover they reckoned H2803 (8762) not with the men H0582, into whose hand H3027 they delivered H5414 (8799) the money H3701 to be bestowed H5414 (8800) on workmen H4399: for they dealt H6213 (8802) faithfully H0530.
012:016 The trespass H0817 money H3701 and sin H2403 money H3701 was not brought H0935 (8714) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: it was the priests H3548 ’.
012:017 Then Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758 went up H5927 (8799), and fought H3898 (8735) against Gath H1661, and took H3920 (8799) it: and Hazael H2371 set H7760 (8799) his face H6440 to go up H5927 (8800) to Jerusalem H3389.
012:018 And Jehoash H3060 king H4428 of Judah H3063 took H3947 (8799) all the hallowed things H6944 that Jehoshaphat H3092, and Jehoram H3088, and Ahaziah H0274, his fathers H0001, kings H4428 of Judah H3063, had dedicated H6942 (8689), and his own hallowed things H6944, and all the gold H2091 [that was] found H4672 (8737) in the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in the king’s H4428 house H1004, and sent H7971 (8799) [it] to Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758: and he went away H5927 (8799) from Jerusalem H3389.
012:019 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Joash H3101, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
012:020 And his servants H5650 arose H6965 (8799), and made H7194 (8799) a conspiracy H7195, and slew H5221 (8686) Joash H3101 in the house H1004 of Millo H4407 (8677) H1037, which goeth down H3381 (8802) to Silla H5538.
012:021 For Jozachar H3108 the son H1121 of Shimeath H8100, and Jehozabad H3075 the son H1121 of Shomer H7763, his servants H5650, smote H5221 (8689) him, and he died H4191 (8799); and they buried H6912 (8799) him with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Amaziah H0558 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
013:001 ¶ In the three H7969 H8141 and twentieth H6242 year H8141 of Joash H3101 the son H1121 of Ahaziah H0274 king H4428 of Judah H3063 Jehoahaz H3059 the son H1121 of Jehu H3058 began to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111, [and reigned] seventeen H7651 H6240 years H8141.
013:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and followed H3212 (8799) H0310 the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, which made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689); he departed H5493 (8804) not therefrom.
013:003 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478, and he delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758, and into the hand H3027 of Benhadad H1130 the son H1121 of Hazael H2371, all [their] days H3117.
013:004 And Jehoahaz H3059 besought H2470 (8762) the LORD H3068, and the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto H6440 him: for he saw H7200 (8804) the oppression H3906 of Israel H3478, because the king H4428 of Syria H0758 oppressed H3905 (8804) them.
013:005 (And the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8799) Israel H3478 a saviour H3467 (8688), so that they went out H3318 (8799) from under the hand H3027 of the Syrians H0758: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8799) in their tents H0168, as beforetime H8032 H8543.
013:006 Nevertheless they departed H5493 (8804) not from the sins H2403 of the house H1004 of Jeroboam H3379, who made Israel H3478 sin H2398 (8689), [but] walked H1980 (8804) therein: and there remained H5975 (8804) the grove H0842 also in Samaria H8111.)
013:007 Neither did he leave H7604 (8689) of the people H5971 to Jehoahaz H3059 but fifty H2572 horsemen H6571, and ten H6235 chariots H7393, and ten H6235 thousand H0505 footmen H7273; for the king H4428 of Syria H0758 had destroyed H0006 (8765) them, and had made H7760 (8799) them like the dust H6083 by threshing H1758 (8800).
013:008 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehoahaz H3059, and all that he did H6213 (8804), and his might H1369, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
013:009 And Jehoahaz H3059 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001; and they buried H6912 (8799) him in Samaria H8111: and Joash H3101 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
013:010 In the thirty H7970 H8141 and seventh H7651 year H8141 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began Jehoash H3060 the son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059 to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111, [and reigned] sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141.
013:011 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068; he departed H5493 (8804) not from all the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 sin H2398 (8689): [but] he walked H1980 (8804) therein.
013:012 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Joash H3101, and all that he did H6213 (8804), and his might H1369 wherewith he fought H3898 (8738) against Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
013:013 And Joash H3101 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001; and Jeroboam H3379 sat H3427 (8804) upon his throne H3678: and Joash H3101 was buried H6912 (8735) in Samaria H8111 with the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
013:014 Now Elisha H0477 was fallen sick H2470 (8804) of his sickness H2483 whereof he died H4191 (8799). And Joash H3101 the king H4428 of Israel H3478 came down H3381 (8799) unto him, and wept H1058 (8799) over his face H6440, and said H0559 (8799), O my father H0001, my father H0001, the chariot H7393 of Israel H3478, and the horsemen H6571 thereof.
013:015 And Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Take H3947 (8798) bow H7198 and arrows H2671. And he took H3947 (8799) unto him bow H7198 and arrows H2671.
013:016 And he said H0559 (8799) to the king H4428 of Israel H3478, Put H7392 (8685) thine hand H3027 upon the bow H7198. And he put H7392 (8686) his hand H3027 [upon it]: and Elisha H0477 put H7760 (8799) his hands H3027 upon the king’s H4428 hands H3027.
013:017 And he said H0559 (8799), Open H6605 (8798) the window H2474 eastward H6924. And he opened H6605 (8799) [it]. Then Elisha H0477 said H0559 (8799), Shoot H3384 (8798). And he shot H3384 (8686). And he said H0559 (8799), The arrow H2671 of the LORD’S H3068 deliverance H8668, and the arrow H2671 of deliverance H8668 from Syria H0758: for thou shalt smite H5221 (8689) the Syrians H0758 in Aphek H0663, till thou have consumed H3615 (8763) [them].
013:018 And he said H0559 (8799), Take H3947 (8798) the arrows H2671. And he took H3947 (8799) [them]. And he said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478, Smite H5221 (8685) upon the ground H0776. And he smote H5221 (8686) thrice H7969 H6471, and stayed H5975 (8799).
013:019 And the man H0376 of God H0430 was wroth H7107 (8799) with him, and said H0559 (8799), Thou shouldest have smitten H5221 (8687) five H2568 or six H8337 times H6471; then hadst thou smitten H5221 (8689) Syria H0758 till thou hadst consumed H3615 (8763) [it]: whereas now thou shalt smite H5221 (8686) Syria H0758 [but] thrice H7969 H6471.
013:020 And Elisha H0477 died H4191 (8799), and they buried H6912 (8799) him. And the bands H1416 of the Moabites H4124 invaded H0935 (8799) the land H0776 at the coming in H0935 (8802) of the year H8141.
013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying H6912 (8802) a man H0376, that, behold, they spied H7200 (8804) a band H1416 [of men]; and they cast H7993 (8686) the man H0376 into the sepulchre H6913 of Elisha H0477: and when the man H0376 was let down H3212 (8799), and touched H5060 (8799) the bones H6106 of Elisha H0477, he revived H2421 (8799), and stood up H6965 (8799) on his feet H7272.
013:022 But Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758 oppressed H3905 (8804) Israel H3478 all the days H3117 of Jehoahaz H3059.
013:023 And the LORD H3068 was gracious H2603 (8799) unto them, and had compassion H7355 (8762) on them, and had respect H6437 (8799) unto them, because of H4616 his covenant H1285 with Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and Jacob H3290, and would H0014 (8804) not destroy H7843 (8687) them, neither cast H7993 (8689) he them from his presence H6440 as yet H5704.
013:024 So Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758 died H4191 (8799); and Benhadad H1130 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
013:025 And Jehoash H3060 the son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059 took H3947 (8799) again H7725 (8799) out of the hand H3027 of Benhadad H1130 the son H1121 of Hazael H2371 the cities H5892, which he had taken H3947 (8804) out of the hand H3027 of Jehoahaz H3059 his father H0001 by war H4421. Three H7969 times H6471 did Joash H3101 beat H5221 (8689) him, and recovered H7725 (8686) the cities H5892 of Israel H3478.
014:001 ¶ In the second H8147 year H8141 of Joash H3101 son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3099 king H4428 of Israel H3478 reigned H4427 (8804) Amaziah H0558 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Judah H3063.
014:002 He was twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) twenty H6242 and nine H8672 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Jehoaddan H3086 of Jerusalem H3389.
014:003 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, yet H7535 not like David H1732 his father H0001: he did H6213 (8804) according to all things as Joash H3101 his father H0001 did H6213 (8804).
014:004 Howbeit the high places H1116 were not taken away H5493 (8804): as yet H5750 the people H5971 did sacrifice H2076 (8764) and burnt incense H6999 (8764) on the high places H1116.
014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom H4467 was confirmed H2388 (8804) in his hand H3027, that he slew H5221 (8686) his servants H5650 which had slain H5221 (8688) the king H4428 his father H0001.
014:006 But the children H1121 of the murderers H5221 (8688) he slew H4191 (8689) not: according unto that which is written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the law H8451 of Moses H4872, wherein the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), The fathers H0001 shall not be put to death H4191 (8714) for the children H1121, nor the children H1121 be put to death H4191 (8714) for the fathers H0001; but every man H0376 shall be put to death H4191 (8799) for his own sin H2399.
014:007 He slew H5221 (8689) of Edom H0123 in the valley H1516 of salt H4417 ten H6235 thousand H0505, and took H8610 (8804) Selah H5554 by war H4421, and called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of it Joktheel H3371 unto this day H3117.
014:008 Then Amaziah H0558 sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 to Jehoash H3060, the son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059 son H1121 of Jehu H3058, king H4428 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Come H3212 (8798), let us look H7200 (8691) one another in the face H6440.
014:009 And Jehoash H3060 the king H4428 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) to Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), The thistle H2336 that [was] in Lebanon H3844 sent H7971 (8804) to the cedar H0730 that [was] in Lebanon H3844, saying H0559 (8800), Give H5414 (8798) thy daughter H1323 to my son H1121 to wife H0802: and there passed H5674 (8799) by a wild H7704 beast H2416 that [was] in Lebanon H3844, and trode down H7429 (8799) the thistle H2336.
014:010 Thou hast indeed H5221 (8687) smitten H5221 (8689) Edom H0123, and thine heart H3820 hath lifted thee up H5375 (8804): glory H3513 (8734) [of this], and tarry H3427 (8798) at home H1004: for why shouldest thou meddle H1624 (8691) to [thy] hurt H7451, that thou shouldest fall H5307 (8804), [even] thou, and Judah H3063 with thee?
014:011 But Amaziah H0558 would not hear H8085 (8804). Therefore Jehoash H3060 king H4428 of Israel H3478 went up H5927 (8799); and he and Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063 looked H7200 (8691) one another in the face H6440 at Bethshemesh H1053, which [belongeth] to Judah H3063.
014:012 And Judah H3063 was put to the worse H5062 (8735) before H6440 Israel H3478; and they fled H5127 (8799) every man H0376 to their tents H0168.
014:013 And Jehoash H3060 king H4428 of Israel H3478 took H8610 (8804) Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, the son H1121 of Jehoash H3060 the son H1121 of Ahaziah H0274, at Bethshemesh H1053, and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389, and brake down H6555 (8799) the wall H2346 of Jerusalem H3389 from the gate H8179 of Ephraim H0669 unto the corner H6438 gate H8179, four H0702 hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
014:014 And he took H3947 (8804) all the gold H2091 and silver H3701, and all the vessels H3627 that were found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and hostages H1121 H8594, and returned H7725 (8799) to Samaria H8111.
014:015 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehoash H3060 which he did H6213 (8804), and his might H1369, and how he fought H3898 (8738) with Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
014:016 And Jehoash H3060 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) in Samaria H8111 with the kings H4428 of Israel H3478; and Jeroboam H3379 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
014:017 And Amaziah H0558 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Judah H3063 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 the death H4194 of Jehoash H3060 son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059 king H4428 of Israel H3478 fifteen H2568 H6240 years H8141.
014:018 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Amaziah H0558, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
014:019 Now they made H7194 (8799) a conspiracy H7195 against him in Jerusalem H3389: and he fled H5127 (8799) to Lachish H3923; but they sent H7971 (8799) after H0310 him to Lachish H3923, and slew H4191 (8686) him there.
014:020 And they brought H5375 (8799) him on horses H5483: and he was buried H6912 (8735) at Jerusalem H3389 with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732.
014:021 And all the people H5971 of Judah H3063 took H3947 (8799) Azariah H5838, which [was] sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 old H1121, and made him king H4427 (8686) instead of his father H0001 Amaziah H0558.
014:022 He built H1129 (8804) Elath H0359, and restored H7725 (8686) it to Judah H3063, after H0310 that the king H4428 slept H7901 (8800) with his fathers H0001.
014:023 In the fifteenth H2568 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Amaziah H0558 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Judah H3063 Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Israel H3478 began to reign H4427 (8804) in Samaria H8111, [and reigned] forty H0705 and one H0259 years H8141.
014:024 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he departed H5493 (8804) not from all the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
014:025 He restored H7725 (8689) the coast H1366 of Israel H3478 from the entering H0935 (8800) of Hamath H2574 unto the sea H3220 of the plain H6160, according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, which he spake H1696 (8765) by the hand H3027 of his servant H5650 Jonah H3124, the son H1121 of Amittai H0573, the prophet H5030, which [was] of Gathhepher H1662.
014:026 For the LORD H3068 saw H7200 (8804) the affliction H6040 of Israel H3478, [that it was] very H3966 bitter H4784 (8802): for [there was] not H0657 any shut up H6113 (8803), nor any left H5800 (8803), nor any helper H5826 (8802) for Israel H3478.
014:027 And the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765) not that he would blot out H4229 (8800) the name H8034 of Israel H3478 from under heaven H8064: but he saved H3467 (8686) them by the hand H3027 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Joash H3101.
014:028 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jeroboam H3379, and all that he did H6213 (8804), and his might H1369, how he warred H3898 (8738), and how he recovered H7725 (8689) Damascus H1834, and Hamath H2574, [which belonged] to Judah H3063, for Israel H3478, are they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
014:029 And Jeroboam H3379 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, [even] with the kings H4428 of Israel H3478; and Zachariah H2148 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
015:001 ¶ In the twenty H6242 H8141 and seventh H7651 year H8141 of Jeroboam H3379 king H4428 of Israel H3478 began Azariah H5838 son H1121 of Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063 to reign H4427 (8804).
015:002 Sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 old H1121 was he when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) two H8147 and fifty H2572 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Jecholiah H3203 of Jerusalem H3389.
015:003 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his father H0001 Amaziah H0558 had done H6213 (8804);
015:004 Save that the high places H1116 were not removed H5493 (8804): the people H5971 sacrificed H2076 (8764) and burnt incense H6999 (8764) still on the high places H1116.
015:005 And the LORD H3068 smote H5060 (8762) the king H4428, so that he was a leper H6879 (8794) unto the day H3117 of his death H4194, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in a several H2669 house H1004. And Jotham H3147 the king’s H4428 son H1121 [was] over the house H1004, judging H8199 (8802) the people H5971 of the land H0776.
015:006 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Azariah H5838, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
015:007 So Azariah H5838 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001; and they buried H6912 (8799) him with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Jotham H3147 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
015:008 In the thirty H7970 H8141 and eighth H8083 year H8141 of Azariah H5838 king H4428 of Judah H3063 did Zachariah H2148 the son H1121 of Jeroboam H3379 reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111 six H8337 months H2320.
015:009 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, as his fathers H0001 had done H6213 (8804): he departed H5493 (8804) not from the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
015:010 And Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Jabesh H3003 conspired H7194 (8799) against him, and smote H5221 (8686) him before H6905 the people H5971, and slew H4191 (8686) him, and reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
015:011 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Zachariah H2148, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
015:012 This [was] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which he spake H1696 (8765) unto Jehu H3058, saying H0559 (8800), Thy sons H1121 shall sit H3427 (8799) on the throne H3678 of Israel H3478 unto the fourth H7243 [generation]. And so it came to pass.
015:013 Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Jabesh H3003 began to reign H4427 (8804) in the nine H8672 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of Uzziah H5818 king H4428 of Judah H3063; and he reigned H4427 (8799) a full H3117 month H3391 in Samaria H8111.
015:014 For Menahem H4505 the son H1121 of Gadi H1424 went up H5927 (8799) from Tirzah H8656, and came H0935 (8799) to Samaria H8111, and smote H5221 (8686) Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Jabesh H3003 in Samaria H8111, and slew H4191 (8686) him, and reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
015:015 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Shallum H7967, and his conspiracy H7195 which he made H7194 (8804), behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
015:016 Then Menahem H4505 smote H5221 (8686) Tiphsah H8607, and all that [were] therein, and the coasts H1366 thereof from Tirzah H8656: because they opened H6605 (8804) not [to him], therefore he smote H5221 (8686) [it; and] all the women therein that were with child H2030 he ripped up H1234 (8765).
015:017 In the nine H8672 H8141 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of Azariah H5838 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began Menahem H4505 the son H1121 of Gadi H1424 to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478, [and reigned] ten H6235 years H8141 in Samaria H8111.
015:018 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he departed H5493 (8804) not all his days H3117 from the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
015:019 [And] Pul H6322 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came H0935 (8804) against the land H0776: and Menahem H4505 gave H5414 (8799) Pul H6322 a thousand H0505 talents H3603 of silver H3701, that his hand H3027 might be with him to confirm H2388 (8687) the kingdom H4467 in his hand H3027.
015:020 And Menahem H4505 exacted H3318 (8686) the money H3701 of Israel H3478, [even] of all the mighty men H1368 of wealth H2428, of each H0259 man H0376 fifty H2572 shekels H8255 of silver H3701, to give H5414 (8800) to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804. So the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 turned back H7725 (8799), and stayed H5975 (8804) not there in the land H0776.
015:021 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Menahem H4505, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478?
015:022 And Menahem H4505 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001; and Pekahiah H6494 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
015:023 In the fiftieth H2572 H8141 year H8141 of Azariah H5838 king H4428 of Judah H3063 Pekahiah H6494 the son H1121 of Menahem H4505 began to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111, [and reigned] two years H8141.
015:024 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he departed H5493 (8804) not from the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
015:025 But Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425, a captain H7991 of his, conspired H7194 (8799) against him, and smote H5221 (8686) him in Samaria H8111, in the palace H0759 of the king’s H4428 house H1004, with Argob H0709 and Arieh H0745, and with him fifty H2572 men H0376 of the Gileadites H1121 H1569: and he killed H4191 (8686) him, and reigned H4427 (8799) in his room.
015:026 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Pekahiah H6494, and all that he did H6213 (8804), behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
015:027 In the two H8147 H8141 and fiftieth H2572 year H8141 of Azariah H5838 king H4428 of Judah H3063 Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425 began to reign H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 in Samaria H8111, [and reigned] twenty H6242 years H8141.
015:028 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he departed H5493 (8804) not from the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689).
015:029 In the days H3117 of Pekah H6492 king H4428 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8804) Tiglathpileser H8407 king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and took H3947 (8799) Ijon H5859, and Abelbethmaachah H0062, and Janoah H3239, and Kedesh H6943, and Hazor H2674, and Gilead H1568, and Galilee H1551, all the land H0776 of Naphtali H5321, and carried them captive H1540 (8686) to Assyria H0804.
015:030 And Hoshea H1954 the son H1121 of Elah H0425 made H7194 (8799) a conspiracy H7195 against Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425, and smote H5221 (8686) him, and slew H4191 (8686) him, and reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead, in the twentieth H6242 year H8141 of Jotham H3147 the son H1121 of Uzziah H5818.
015:031 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Pekah H6492, and all that he did H6213 (8804), behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
015:032 In the second H8147 year H8141 of Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425 king H4428 of Israel H3478 began Jotham H3147 the son H1121 of Uzziah H5818 king H4428 of Judah H3063 to reign H4427 (8804).
015:033 Five H2568 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 was he when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Jerusha H3388, the daughter H1323 of Zadok H6659.
015:034 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068: he did H6213 (8804) according to all that his father H0001 Uzziah H5818 had done H6213 (8804).
015:035 Howbeit the high places H1116 were not removed H5493 (8804): the people H5971 sacrificed H2076 (8764) and burned incense H6999 (8764) still in the high places H1116. He built H1129 (8804) the higher H5945 gate H8179 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
015:036 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jotham H3147, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
015:037 In those days H3117 the LORD H3068 began H2490 (8689) to send H7971 (8687) against Judah H3063 Rezin H7526 the king H4428 of Syria H0758, and Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425.
015:038 And Jotham H3147 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732 his father H0001: and Ahaz H0271 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
016:001 ¶ In the seventeenth H7651 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425 Ahaz H0271 the son H1121 of Jotham H3147 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began to reign H4427 (8804).
016:002 Twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 [was] Ahaz H0271 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389, and did H6213 (8804) not [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430, like David H1732 his father H0001.
016:003 But he walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, yea, and made his son H1121 to pass through H5674 (8689) the fire H0784, according to the abominations H8441 of the heathen H1471, whom the LORD H3068 cast out H3423 (8689) from before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
016:004 And he sacrificed H2076 (8762) and burnt incense H6999 (8762) in the high places H1116, and on the hills H1389, and under every green H7488 tree H6086.
016:005 Then Rezin H7526 king H4428 of Syria H0758 and Pekah H6492 son H1121 of Remaliah H7425 king H4428 of Israel H3478 came up H5927 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 to war H4421: and they besieged H6696 (8799) Ahaz H0271, but could H3201 (8804) not overcome H3898 (8736) [him].
016:006 At that time H6256 Rezin H7526 king H4428 of Syria H0758 recovered H7725 (8689) Elath H0359 to Syria H0758 (8675) H0130, and drave H5394 (8762) the Jews H3064 from Elath H0359: and the Syrians H0726 came H0935 (8804) to Elath H0359, and dwelt H3427 (8799) there unto this day H3117.
016:007 So Ahaz H0271 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to Tiglathpileser H8407 king H4428 of Assyria H0804, saying H0559 (8800), I [am] thy servant H5650 and thy son H1121: come up H5927 (8798), and save H3467 (8685) me out of the hand H3709 of the king H4428 of Syria H0758, and out of the hand H3709 of the king H4428 of Israel H3478, which rise up H6965 (8801) against me.
016:008 And Ahaz H0271 took H3947 (8799) the silver H3701 and gold H2091 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and sent H7971 (8799) [it for] a present H7810 to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
016:009 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto him: for the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 went up H5927 (8799) against Damascus H1834, and took H8610 (8799) it, and carried [the people of] it captive H1540 (8686) to Kir H7024, and slew H4191 (8689) Rezin H7526.
016:010 And king H4428 Ahaz H0271 went H3212 (8799) to Damascus H1834 to meet H7125 (8800) Tiglathpileser H8407 king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and saw H7200 (8799) an altar H4196 that [was] at Damascus H1834: and king H4428 Ahaz H0271 sent H7971 (8799) to Urijah H0223 the priest H3548 the fashion H1823 of the altar H4196, and the pattern H8403 of it, according to all the workmanship H4639 thereof.
016:011 And Urijah H0223 the priest H3548 built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 according to all that king H4428 Ahaz H0271 had sent H7971 (8804) from Damascus H1834: so Urijah H0223 the priest H3548 made H6213 (8804) [it] against king H4428 Ahaz H0271 came H0935 (8800) from Damascus H1834.
016:012 And when the king H4428 was come H0935 (8799) from Damascus H1834, the king H4428 saw H7200 (8799) the altar H4196: and the king H4428 approached H7126 (8799) to the altar H4196, and offered H5927 (8686) thereon.
016:013 And he burnt H6999 (8686) his burnt offering H5930 and his meat offering H4503, and poured H5258 (8686) his drink offering H5262, and sprinkled H2236 (8799) the blood H1818 of his peace offerings H8002, upon the altar H4196.
016:014 And he brought H7126 (8686) also the brasen H5178 altar H4196, which [was] before H6440 the LORD H3068, from the forefront H6440 of the house H1004, from between the altar H4196 and the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and put H5414 (8799) it on the north H6828 side H3409 of the altar H4196.
016:015 And king H4428 Ahaz H0271 commanded H6680 (8762) Urijah H0223 the priest H3548, saying H0559 (8800), Upon the great H1419 altar H4196 burn H6999 (8685) the morning H1242 burnt offering H5930, and the evening H6153 meat offering H4503, and the king’s H4428 burnt sacrifice H5930, and his meat offering H4503, with the burnt offering H5930 of all the people H5971 of the land H0776, and their meat offering H4503, and their drink offerings H5262; and sprinkle H2236 (8799) upon it all the blood H1818 of the burnt offering H5930, and all the blood H1818 of the sacrifice H2077: and the brasen H5178 altar H4196 shall be for me to enquire H1239 (8763) [by].
016:016 Thus did H6213 (8799) Urijah H0223 the priest H3548, according to all that king H4428 Ahaz H0271 commanded H6680 (8765).
016:017 And king H4428 Ahaz H0271 cut off H7112 (8762) the borders H4526 of the bases H4350, and removed H5493 (8686) the laver H3595 from off them; and took down H3381 (8689) the sea H3220 from off the brasen H5178 oxen H1241 that [were] under it, and put H5414 (8799) it upon a pavement H4837 of stones H0068.
016:018 And the covert H4329 (8675) H4329 for the sabbath H7676 that they had built H1129 (8804) in the house H1004, and the king’s H4428 entry H3996 without H2435, turned H5437 (8689) he from the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 for H6440 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
016:019 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Ahaz H0271 which he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
016:020 And Ahaz H0271 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Hezekiah H2396 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
017:001 ¶ In the twelfth H8147 H6240 year H8141 of Ahaz H0271 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began Hoshea H1954 the son H1121 of Elah H0425 to reign H4427 (8804) in Samaria H8111 over Israel H3478 nine H8672 years H8141.
017:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, but not as the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 that were before H6440 him.
017:003 Against him came up H5927 (8804) Shalmaneser H8022 king H4428 of Assyria H0804; and Hoshea H1954 became his servant H5650, and gave H7725 (8686) him presents H4503.
017:004 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 found H4672 (8799) conspiracy H7195 in Hoshea H1954: for he had sent H7971 (8804) messengers H4397 to So H5471 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and brought H5927 (8689) no present H4503 to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, as [he had done] year H8141 by year H8141: therefore the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 shut him up H6113 (8799), and bound H0631 (8799) him in prison H1004 H3608.
017:005 Then the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came up H5927 (8799) throughout all the land H0776, and went up H5927 (8799) to Samaria H8111, and besieged H6696 (8799) it three H7969 years H8141.
017:006 In the ninth H8671 year H8141 of Hoshea H1954 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 took H3920 (8804) Samaria H8111, and carried H1540 Israel H3478 away H1540 (8686) into Assyria H0804, and placed H3427 (8686) them in Halah H2477 and in Habor H2249 [by] the river H5104 of Gozan H1470, and in the cities H5892 of the Medes H4074.
017:007 For [so] it was, that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 had sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 their God H0430, which had brought them up H5927 (8688) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from under the hand H3027 of Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and had feared H3372 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430,
017:008 And walked H3212 (8799) in the statutes H2708 of the heathen H1471, whom the LORD H3068 cast out H3423 (8689) from before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, which they had made H6213 (8804).
017:009 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did secretly H2644 (8762) [those] things H1697 that [were] not right against the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and they built H1129 (8799) them high places H1116 in all their cities H5892, from the tower H4026 of the watchmen H5341 (8802) to the fenced H4013 city H5892.
017:010 And they set them up H5324 (8686) images H4676 and groves H0842 in every high H1364 hill H1389, and under every green H7488 tree H6086:
017:011 And there they burnt incense H6999 (8762) in all the high places H1116, as [did] the heathen H1471 whom the LORD H3068 carried away H1540 (8689) before H6440 them; and wrought H6213 (8799) wicked H7451 things H1697 to provoke the LORD H3068 to anger H3707 (8687):
017:012 For they served H5647 (8799) idols H1544, whereof the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8804) unto them, Ye shall not do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697.
017:013 Yet the LORD H3068 testified H5749 (8686) against Israel H3478, and against Judah H3063, by H3027 all the prophets H5030, [and by] all the seers H2374, saying H0559 (8800), Turn H7725 (8798) ye from your evil H7451 ways H1870, and keep H8104 (8798) my commandments H4687 [and] my statutes H2708, according to all the law H8451 which I commanded H6680 (8765) your fathers H0001, and which I sent H7971 (8804) to you by H3027 my servants H5650 the prophets H5030.
017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear H8085 (8804), but hardened H7185 (8686) their necks H6203, like to the neck H6203 of their fathers H0001, that did not believe H0539 (8689) in the LORD H3068 their God H0430.
017:015 And they rejected H3988 (8799) his statutes H2706, and his covenant H1285 that he made H3772 (8804) with their fathers H0001, and his testimonies H5715 which he testified H5749 (8689) against them; and they followed H3212 (8799) H0310 vanity H1892, and became vain H1891 (8799), and went after H0310 the heathen H1471 that [were] round about H5439 them, [concerning] whom the LORD H3068 had charged H6680 (8765) them, that they should not do H6213 (8800) like them.
017:016 And they left H5800 (8799) all the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and made H6213 (8799) them molten images H4541, [even] two H8147 calves H5695, and made H6213 (8799) a grove H0842, and worshipped H7812 (8691) all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, and served H5647 (8799) Baal H1168.
017:017 And they caused their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 to pass H5674 (8686) through the fire H0784, and used H7080 (8799) divination H7081 and enchantments H5172 (8762), and sold H4376 (8691) themselves to do H6213 (8800) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, to provoke him to anger H3707 (8687).
017:018 Therefore the LORD H3068 was very H3966 angry H0599 (8691) with Israel H3478, and removed H5493 (8686) them out of his sight H6440: there was none left H7604 (8738) but the tribe H7626 of Judah H3063 only.
017:019 Also Judah H3063 kept H8104 (8804) not the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, but walked H3212 (8799) in the statutes H2708 of Israel H3478 which they made H6213 (8804).
017:020 And the LORD H3068 rejected H3988 (8799) all the seed H2233 of Israel H3478, and afflicted H6031 (8762) them, and delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of spoilers H8154 (8802), until he had cast H7993 (8689) them out of his sight H6440.
017:021 For he rent H7167 (8804) Israel H3478 from the house H1004 of David H1732; and they made Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028 king H4427 (8686): and Jeroboam H3379 drave H5080 (8686) (8675) H5077 (8686) Israel H3478 from following H0310 the LORD H3068, and made them sin H2398 (8689) a great H1419 sin H2401.
017:022 For the children H1121 of Israel H3478 walked H3212 (8799) in all the sins H2403 of Jeroboam H3379 which he did H6213 (8804); they departed H5493 (8804) not from them;
017:023 Until the LORD H3068 removed H5493 (8689) Israel H3478 out of his sight H6440, as he had said H1696 (8765) by H3027 all his servants H5650 the prophets H5030. So was Israel H3478 carried away H1540 (8799) out of their own land H0127 to Assyria H0804 unto this day H3117.
017:024 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 brought H0935 (8686) [men] from Babylon H0894, and from Cuthah H3575, and from Ava H5755, and from Hamath H2574, and from Sepharvaim H5617, and placed H3427 (8686) [them] in the cities H5892 of Samaria H8111 instead of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and they possessed H3423 (8799) Samaria H8111, and dwelt H3427 (8799) in the cities H5892 thereof.
017:025 And [so] it was at the beginning H8462 of their dwelling H3427 (8800) there, [that] they feared H3372 (8804) not the LORD H3068: therefore the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8762) lions H0738 among them, which slew H2026 (8802) [some] of them.
017:026 Wherefore they spake H0559 (8799) to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, saying H0559 (8800), The nations H1471 which thou hast removed H1540 (8689), and placed H3427 (8686) in the cities H5892 of Samaria H8111, know H3045 (8804) not the manner H4941 of the God H0430 of the land H0776: therefore he hath sent H7971 (8762) lions H0738 among them, and, behold, they slay H4191 (8688) them, because they know H3045 (8802) not the manner H4941 of the God H0430 of the land H0776.
017:027 Then the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 commanded H6680 (8762), saying H0559 (8800), Carry H3212 (8685) thither one H0259 of the priests H3548 whom ye brought H1540 (8689) from thence; and let them go H3212 (8799) and dwell H3427 (8799) there, and let him teach H3384 (8686) them the manner H4941 of the God H0430 of the land H0776.
017:028 Then one H0259 of the priests H3548 whom they had carried away H1540 (8689) from Samaria H8111 came H0935 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in Bethel H1008, and taught H3384 (8688) them how they should fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068.
017:029 Howbeit every nation H1471 made H6213 (8802) gods H0430 of their own, and put H3240 (8686) [them] in the houses H1004 of the high places H1116 which the Samaritans H8118 had made H6213 (8804), every nation H1471 in their cities H5892 wherein they dwelt H3427 (8802).
017:030 And the men H0582 of Babylon H0894 made H6213 (8804) Succothbenoth H5524, and the men H0582 of Cuth H3575 made H6213 (8804) Nergal H5370, and the men H0582 of Hamath H2574 made H6213 (8804) Ashima H0807,
017:031 And the Avites H5757 made H6213 (8804) Nibhaz H5026 and Tartak H8662, and the Sepharvites H5616 burnt H8313 (8802) their children H1121 in fire H0784 to Adrammelech H0152 and Anammelech H6048, the gods H0430 of Sepharvaim H5617.
017:032 So they feared H3373 the LORD H3068, and made H6213 (8799) unto themselves of the lowest H7098 of them priests H3548 of the high places H1116, which sacrificed H6213 (8802) for them in the houses H1004 of the high places H1116.
017:033 They feared H3373 the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8802) their own gods H0430, after the manner H4941 of the nations H1471 whom they carried away H1540 (8689) from thence.
017:034 Unto this day H3117 they do H6213 (8802) after the former H7223 manners H4941: they fear H3373 not the LORD H3068, neither do H6213 (8802) they after their statutes H2708, or after their ordinances H4941, or after the law H8451 and commandment H4687 which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) the children H1121 of Jacob H3290, whom he named H7760 (8804) H8034 Israel H3478;
017:035 With whom the LORD H3068 had made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285, and charged H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not fear H3372 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430, nor bow H7812 (8691) yourselves to them, nor serve H5647 (8799) them, nor sacrifice H2076 (8799) to them:
017:036 But the LORD H3068, who brought you up H5927 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 with great H1419 power H3581 and a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, him shall ye fear H3372 (8799), and him shall ye worship H7812 (8691), and to him shall ye do sacrifice H2076 (8799).
017:037 And the statutes H2706, and the ordinances H4941, and the law H8451, and the commandment H4687, which he wrote H3789 (8804) for you, ye shall observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) for evermore H3117; and ye shall not fear H3372 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430.
017:038 And the covenant H1285 that I have made H3772 (8804) with you ye shall not forget H7911 (8799); neither shall ye fear H3372 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430.
017:039 But the LORD H3068 your God H0430 ye shall fear H3372 (8799); and he shall deliver H5337 (8686) you out of the hand H3027 of all your enemies H0341 (8802).
017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken H8085 (8804), but they did H6213 (8802) after their former H7223 manner H4941.
017:041 So these nations H1471 feared H3373 the LORD H3068, and served H5647 (8802) their graven images H6456, both their children H1121, and their children’s H1121 children H1121: as did H6213 (8804) their fathers H0001, so do H6213 (8802) they unto this day H3117.
018:001 ¶ Now it came to pass in the third H7969 year H8141 of Hoshea H1954 son H1121 of Elah H0425 king H4428 of Israel H3478, [that] Hezekiah H2396 the son H1121 of Ahaz H0271 king H4428 of Judah H3063 began to reign H4427 (8804).
018:002 Twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 was he when he began to reign H4427 (8800); and he reigned H4427 (8804) twenty H6242 and nine H8672 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Abi H0021, the daughter H1323 of Zachariah H2148.
018:003 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that David H1732 his father H0001 did H6213 (8804).
018:004 He removed H5493 (8689) the high places H1116, and brake H7665 (8765) the images H4676, and cut down H3772 (8804) the groves H0842, and brake in pieces H3807 (8765) the brasen H5178 serpent H5175 that Moses H4872 had made H6213 (8804): for unto those days H3117 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did burn incense H6999 (8764) to it: and he called H7121 (8799) it Nehushtan H5180.
018:005 He trusted H0982 (8804) in the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478; so that after H0310 him was none like him among all the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, nor [any] that were before H6440 him.
018:006 For he clave H1692 (8799) to the LORD H3068, [and] departed H5493 (8804) not from following H0310 him, but kept H8104 (8799) his commandments H4687, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
018:007 And the LORD H3068 was with him; [and] he prospered H7919 (8686) whithersoever he went forth H3318 (8799): and he rebelled H4775 (8799) against the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and served H5647 (8804) him not.
018:008 He smote H5221 (8689) the Philistines H6430, [even] unto Gaza H5804, and the borders H1366 thereof, from the tower H4026 of the watchmen H5341 (8802) to the fenced H4013 city H5892.
018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of king H4428 Hezekiah H2396, which [was] the seventh H7637 year H8141 of Hoshea H1954 son H1121 of Elah H0425 king H4428 of Israel H3478, [that] Shalmaneser H8022 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came up H5927 (8804) against Samaria H8111, and besieged H6696 (8799) it.
018:010 And at the end H7097 of three H7969 years H8141 they took H3920 (8799) it: [even] in the sixth H8337 year H8141 of Hezekiah H2396, that [is] the ninth H8672 year H8141 of Hoshea H1954 king H4428 of Israel H3478, Samaria H8111 was taken H3920 (8738).
018:011 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 did carry away H1540 (8686) Israel H3478 unto Assyria H0804, and put H5148 (8686) them in Halah H2477 and in Habor H2249 [by] the river H5104 of Gozan H1470, and in the cities H5892 of the Medes H4074:
018:012 Because they obeyed H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, but transgressed H5674 (8799) his covenant H1285, [and] all that Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765), and would not hear H8085 (8804) [them], nor do H6213 (8804) [them].
018:013 Now in the fourteenth H0702 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 did Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 come up H5927 (8804) against all the fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and took H8610 (8799) them.
018:014 And Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 sent H7971 (8799) to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 to Lachish H3923, saying H0559 (8800), I have offended H2398 (8804); return H7725 (8798) from me: that which thou puttest H5414 (8799) on me will I bear H5375 (8799). And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 appointed H7760 (8799) unto Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 three H7969 hundred H3967 talents H3603 of silver H3701 and thirty H7970 talents H3603 of gold H2091.
018:015 And Hezekiah H2396 gave H5414 (8799) [him] all the silver H3701 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004.
018:016 At that time H6256 did Hezekiah H2396 cut off H7112 (8765) [the gold from] the doors H1817 of the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, and [from] the pillars H0547 which Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 had overlaid H6823 (8765), and gave H5414 (8799) it to the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
018:017 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 sent H7971 (8799) Tartan H8661 and Rabsaris H7249 and Rabshakeh H7262 from Lachish H3923 to king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 with a great H3515 host H2426 against Jerusalem H3389. And they went up H5927 (8799) and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389. And when they were come up H5927 (8799), they came H0935 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) by the conduit H8585 of the upper H5945 pool H1295, which [is] in the highway H4546 of the fuller’s H3526 (8801) field H7704.
018:018 And when they had called H7121 (8799) to the king H4428, there came out H3318 (8799) to them Eliakim H0471 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, which [was] over the household H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Joah H3098 the son H1121 of Asaph H0623 the recorder H2142 (8688).
018:019 And Rabshakeh H7262 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Speak H0559 (8798) ye now to Hezekiah H2396, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the great H1419 king H4428, the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, What confidence H0986 [is] this wherein thou trustest H0982 (8804)?
018:020 Thou sayest H0559 (8804), (but [they are but] vain H8193 words H1697,) [I have] counsel H6098 and strength H1369 for the war H4421. Now on whom dost thou trust H0982 (8804), that thou rebellest H4775 (8804) against me?
018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest H0982 (8804) upon the staff H4938 of this bruised H7533 (8803) reed H7070, [even] upon Egypt H4714, on which if a man H0376 lean H5564 (8735), it will go H0935 (8804) into his hand H3709, and pierce H5344 (8804) it: so [is] Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 unto all that trust H0982 (8802) on him.
018:022 But if ye say H0559 (8799) unto me, We trust H0982 (8804) in the LORD H3068 our God H0430: [is] not that he, whose high places H1116 and whose altars H4196 Hezekiah H2396 hath taken away H5493 (8689), and hath said H0559 (8799) to Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, Ye shall worship H7812 (8691) before H6440 this altar H4196 in Jerusalem H3389?
018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges H6148 (8690) to my lord H0113 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and I will deliver H5414 (8799) thee two thousand H0505 horses H5483, if thou be able H3201 (8799) on thy part to set H5414 (8800) riders H7392 (8802) upon them.
018:024 How then wilt thou turn away H7725 (8686) the face H6440 of one H0259 captain H6346 of the least H6996 of my master’s H0113 servants H5650, and put thy trust H0982 (8799) on Egypt H4714 for chariots H7393 and for horsemen H6571?
018:025 Am I now come up H5927 (8804) without H1107 the LORD H3068 against this place H4725 to destroy H7843 (8687) it? The LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) to me, Go up H5927 (8798) against this land H0776, and destroy H7843 (8685) it.
018:026 Then said H0559 (8799) Eliakim H0471 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, and Shebna H7644, and Joah H3098, unto Rabshakeh H7262, Speak H1696 (8761), I pray thee, to thy servants H5650 in the Syrian language H0762; for we understand H8085 (8802) [it]: and talk H1696 (8762) not with us in the Jews’ language H3066 in the ears H0241 of the people H5971 that [are] on the wall H2346.
018:027 But Rabshakeh H7262 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hath my master H0113 sent H7971 (8804) me to thy master H0113, and to thee, to speak H1696 (8763) these words H1697? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men H0582 which sit H3427 (8802) on the wall H2346, that they may eat H0398 (8800) their own dung H6675 (8675) H2755, and drink H8354 (8800) their own piss H4325 H7272 (8675) H7890 with you?
018:028 Then Rabshakeh H7262 stood H5975 (8799) and cried H7121 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963 in the Jews’ language H3066, and spake H1696 (8762), saying H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the great H1419 king H4428, the king H4428 of Assyria H0804:
018:029 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428, Let not Hezekiah H2396 deceive H5377 (8686) you: for he shall not be able H3201 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8687) you out of his hand H3027:
018:030 Neither let Hezekiah H2396 make you trust H0982 (8686) in the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 will surely H5337 (8687) deliver H5337 (8686) us, and this city H5892 shall not be delivered H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
018:031 Hearken H8085 (8799) not to Hezekiah H2396: for thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, Make H6213 (8798) [an agreement] with me by a present H1293, and come out H3318 (8798) to me, and [then] eat H0398 (8798) ye every man H0376 of his own vine H1612, and every one H0376 of his fig tree H8384, and drink H8354 (8798) ye every one H0376 the waters H4325 of his cistern H0953:
018:032 Until I come H0935 (8800) and take you away H3947 (8804) to a land H0776 like your own land H0776, a land H0776 of corn H1715 and wine H8492, a land H0776 of bread H3899 and vineyards H3754, a land H0776 of oil H3323 olive H2132 and of honey H1706, that ye may live H2421 (8798), and not die H4191 (8799): and hearken H8085 (8799) not unto Hezekiah H2396, when he persuadeth H5496 (8686) you, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 will deliver H5337 (8686) us.
018:033 Hath any H0376 of the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 delivered H5337 (8689) at all H5337 (8687) his land H0776 out of the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804?
018:034 Where [are] the gods H0430 of Hamath H2574, and of Arpad H0774? where [are] the gods H0430 of Sepharvaim H5617, Hena H2012, and Ivah H5755? have they delivered H5337 (8689) Samaria H8111 out of mine hand H3027?
018:035 Who [are] they among all the gods H0430 of the countries H0776, that have delivered H5337 (8689) their country H0776 out of mine hand H3027, that the LORD H3068 should deliver H5337 (8686) Jerusalem H3389 out of mine hand H3027?
018:036 But the people H5971 held their peace H2790 (8689), and answered H6030 (8804) him not a word H1697: for the king’s H4428 commandment H4687 was, saying H0559 (8800), Answer H6030 (8799) him not.
018:037 Then came H0935 (8799) Eliakim H0471 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, which [was] over the household H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Joah H3098 the son H1121 of Asaph H0623 the recorder H2142 (8688), to Hezekiah H2396 with [their] clothes H0899 rent H7167 (8803), and told H5046 (8686) him the words H1697 of Rabshakeh H7262.
019:001 ¶ And it came to pass, when king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 heard H8085 (8800) [it], that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899, and covered H3680 (8691) himself with sackcloth H8242, and went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
019:002 And he sent H7971 (8799) Eliakim H0471, which [was] over the household H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and the elders H2205 of the priests H3548, covered H3680 (8693) with sackcloth H8242, to Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531.
019:003 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) Hezekiah H2396, This day H3117 [is] a day H3117 of trouble H6869, and of rebuke H8433, and blasphemy H5007: for the children H1121 are come H0935 (8804) to the birth H4866, and [there is] not strength H3581 to bring forth H3205 (8800).
019:004 It may be H0194 the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will hear H8085 (8799) all the words H1697 of Rabshakeh H7262, whom the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 his master H0113 hath sent H7971 (8804) to reproach H2778 (8763) the living H2416 God H0430; and will reprove H3198 (8689) the words H1697 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath heard H8085 (8804): wherefore lift up H5375 (8804) [thy] prayer H8605 for the remnant H7611 that are left H4672 (8737).
019:005 So the servants H5650 of king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 came H0935 (8799) to Isaiah H3470.
019:006 And Isaiah H3470 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) to your master H0113, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 the words H1697 which thou hast heard H8085 (8804), with which the servants H5288 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 have blasphemed H1442 (8765) me.
019:007 Behold, I will send H5414 (8802) a blast H7307 upon him, and he shall hear H8085 (8804) a rumour H8052, and shall return H7725 (8804) to his own land H0776; and I will cause him to fall H5307 (8689) by the sword H2719 in his own land H0776.
019:008 So Rabshakeh H7262 returned H7725 (8799), and found H4672 (8799) the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 warring H3898 (8737) against Libnah H3841: for he had heard H8085 (8804) that he was departed H5265 (8804) from Lachish H3923.
019:009 And when he heard H8085 (8799) say H0559 (8800) of Tirhakah H8640 king H4428 of Ethiopia H3568, Behold, he is come out H3318 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) against thee: he sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 again H7725 (8799) unto Hezekiah H2396, saying H0559 (8800),
019:010 Thus shall ye speak H0559 (8799) to Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), Let not thy God H0430 in whom thou trustest H0982 (8802) deceive H5377 (8686) thee, saying H0559 (8800), Jerusalem H3389 shall not be delivered H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
019:011 Behold, thou hast heard H8085 (8804) what the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 have done H6213 (8804) to all lands H0776, by destroying them utterly H2763 (8687): and shalt thou be delivered H5337 (8735)?
019:012 Have the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 delivered H5337 (8689) them which my fathers H0001 have destroyed H7843 (8765); [as] Gozan H1470, and Haran H2771, and Rezeph H7530, and the children H1121 of Eden H5729 which [were] in Thelasar H8515?
019:013 Where [is] the king H4428 of Hamath H2574, and the king H4428 of Arpad H0774, and the king H4428 of the city H5892 of Sepharvaim H5617, of Hena H2012, and Ivah H5755?
019:014 And Hezekiah H2396 received H3947 (8799) the letter H5612 of the hand H3027 of the messengers H4397, and read H7121 (8799) it: and Hezekiah H2396 went up H5927 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and spread H6566 (8799) it before H6440 the LORD H3068.
019:015 And Hezekiah H2396 prayed H6419 (8691) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, which dwellest H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742, thou art the God H0430, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776; thou hast made H6213 (8804) heaven H8064 and earth H0776.
019:016 LORD H3068, bow down H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241, and hear H8085 (8798): open H6491 (8798), LORD H3068, thine eyes H5869, and see H7200 (8798): and hear H8085 (8798) the words H1697 of Sennacherib H5576, which hath sent H7971 (8804) him to reproach H2778 (8763) the living H2416 God H0430.
019:017 Of a truth H0551, LORD H3068, the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 have destroyed H2717 (8689) the nations H1471 and their lands H0776,
019:018 And have cast H5414 (8804) their gods H0430 into the fire H0784: for they [were] no gods H0430, but the work H4639 of men’s H0120 hands H3027, wood H6086 and stone H0068: therefore they have destroyed H0006 (8762) them.
019:019 Now therefore, O LORD H3068 our God H0430, I beseech thee, save H3467 (8685) thou us out of his hand H3027, that all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776 may know H3045 (8799) that thou [art] the LORD H3068 God H0430, [even] thou only.
019:020 Then Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 sent H7971 (8799) to Hezekiah H2396, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, [That] which thou hast prayed H6419 (8694) to me against Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 I have heard H8085 (8804).
019:021 This [is] the word H1697 that the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) concerning him; The virgin H1330 the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726 hath despised H0959 (8804) thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn H3932 (8804); the daughter H1323 of Jerusalem H3389 hath shaken H5128 (8689) her head H7218 at thee H0310.
019:022 Whom hast thou reproached H2778 (8765) and blasphemed H1442 (8765)? and against whom hast thou exalted H7311 (8689) [thy] voice H6963, and lifted up H5375 (8799) thine eyes H5869 on high H4791? [even] against the Holy H6918 [One] of Israel H3478.
019:023 By H3027 thy messengers H4397 thou hast reproached H2778 (8765) the Lord H0136, and hast said H0559 (8799), With the multitude H7230 of my chariots H7393 (8675) H7393 I am come up H5927 (8804) to the height H4791 of the mountains H2022, to the sides H3411 of Lebanon H3844, and will cut down H3772 (8799) the tall H6967 cedar trees H0730 thereof, [and] the choice H4004 fir trees H1265 thereof: and I will enter H0935 (8799) into the lodgings H4411 of his borders H7093, [and into] the forest H3293 of his Carmel H3760.
019:024 I have digged H6979 (8804) and drunk H8354 (8804) strange H2114 (8801) waters H4325, and with the sole H3709 of my feet H6471 have I dried H2717 (8686) up all the rivers H2975 of besieged places H4693.
019:025 Hast thou not heard H8085 (8804) long ago H7350 [how] I have done H6213 (8804) it, [and] of ancient H6924 times H3117 that I have formed H3335 (8804) it? now have I brought H0935 (8689) it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste H7582 (8687) fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 [into] ruinous H5327 (8737) heaps H1530.
019:026 Therefore their inhabitants H3427 (8802) were of small H7116 power H3027, they were dismayed H2865 (8804) and confounded H0954 (8799); they were [as] the grass H6212 of the field H7704, and [as] the green H3419 herb H1877, [as] the grass H2682 on the housetops H1406, and [as corn] blasted H7711 before H6440 it be grown up H7054.
019:027 But I know H3045 (8804) thy abode H3427 (8800), and thy going out H3318 (8800), and thy coming in H0935 (8800), and thy rage H7264 (8692) against me.
019:028 Because thy rage H7264 (8692) against me and thy tumult H7600 is come up H5927 (8804) into mine ears H0241, therefore I will put H7760 (8804) my hook H2397 in thy nose H0639, and my bridle H4964 in thy lips H8193, and I will turn thee back H7725 (8689) by the way H1870 by which thou camest H0935 (8804).
019:029 And this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto thee, Ye shall eat H0398 (8800) this year H8141 such things as grow H5599 of themselves, and in the second H8145 year H8141 that which springeth H7823 of the same; and in the third H7992 year H8141 sow H2232 (8798) ye, and reap H7114 (8798), and plant H5193 (8798) vineyards H3754, and eat H0398 (8798) the fruits H6529 thereof.
019:030 And the remnant H7604 (8737) that is escaped H6413 of the house H1004 of Judah H3063 shall yet again H3254 (8804) take root H8328 downward H4295, and bear H6213 (8804) fruit H6529 upward H4605.
019:031 For out of Jerusalem H3389 shall go forth H3318 (8799) a remnant H7611, and they that escape H6413 out of mount H2022 Zion H6726: the zeal H7068 of the LORD H3068 [of hosts (8675) H6635 ] shall do H6213 (8799) this.
019:032 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, He shall not come H0935 (8799) into this city H5892, nor shoot H3384 (8686) an arrow H2671 there, nor come before H6923 (8762) it with shield H4043, nor cast H8210 (8799) a bank H5550 against it.
019:033 By the way H1870 that he came H0935 (8799), by the same shall he return H7725 (8799), and shall not come H0935 (8799) into this city H5892, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
019:034 For I will defend H1598 (8804) this city H5892, to save H3467 (8687) it, for mine own sake, and for my servant H5650 David’s H1732 sake.
019:035 And it came to pass that night H3915, that the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 went out H3318 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) in the camp H4264 of the Assyrians H0804 an hundred H3967 fourscore H8084 and five H2568 thousand H0505: and when they arose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, behold, they [were] all dead H4191 (8801) corpses H6297.
019:036 So Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 departed H5265 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) and returned H7725 (8799), and dwelt H3427 (8799) at Nineveh H5210.
019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping H7812 (8693) in the house H1004 of Nisroch H5268 his god H0430, that Adrammelech H0152 and Sharezer H8272 his sons H1121 smote H5221 (8689) him with the sword H2719: and they escaped H4422 (8738) into the land H0776 of Armenia H0780. And Esarhaddon H0634 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
020:001 ¶ In those days H3117 was Hezekiah H2396 sick H2470 (8804) unto death H4191 (8800). And the prophet H5030 Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 came H0935 (8799) to him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Set thine house H1004 in order H6680 (8761); for thou shalt die H4191 (8801), and not live H2421 (8799).
020:002 Then he turned H5437 (8686) his face H6440 to the wall H7023, and prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
020:003 I beseech H0577 thee, O LORD H3068, remember H2142 (8798) now how I have walked H1980 (8694) before H6440 thee in truth H0571 and with a perfect H8003 heart H3824, and have done H6213 (8804) [that which is] good H2896 in thy sight H5869. And Hezekiah H2396 wept H1058 (8799) H1065 sore H1419.
020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah H3470 was gone out H3318 (8804) into the middle H8484 court H2691 (8675) H5892, that the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to him, saying H0559 (8800),
020:005 Turn again H7725 (8798), and tell H0559 (8804) Hezekiah H2396 the captain H5057 of my people H5971, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of David H1732 thy father H0001, I have heard H8085 (8804) thy prayer H8605, I have seen H7200 (8804) thy tears H1832: behold, I will heal H7495 (8802) thee: on the third H7992 day H3117 thou shalt go up H5927 (8799) unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
020:006 And I will add H3254 (8689) unto thy days H3117 fifteen H2568 H6240 years H8141; and I will deliver H5337 (8686) thee and this city H5892 out of the hand H3709 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804; and I will defend H1598 (8804) this city H5892 for mine own sake, and for my servant H5650 David’s H1732 sake.
020:007 And Isaiah H3470 said H0559 (8799), Take H3947 (8798) a lump H1690 of figs H8384. And they took H3947 (8799) and laid H7760 (8799) [it] on the boil H7822, and he recovered H2421 (8799).
020:008 And Hezekiah H2396 said H0559 (8799) unto Isaiah H3470, What [shall be] the sign H0226 that the LORD H3068 will heal H7495 (8799) me, and that I shall go up H5927 (8804) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 the third H7992 day H3117?
020:009 And Isaiah H3470 said H0559 (8799), This sign H0226 shalt thou have of the LORD H3068, that the LORD H3068 will do H6213 (8799) the thing H1697 that he hath spoken H1696 (8765): shall the shadow H6738 go forward H1980 (8804) ten H6235 degrees H4609, or go back H7725 (8799) ten H6235 degrees H4609?
020:010 And Hezekiah H3169 answered H0559 (8799), It is a light thing H7043 (8738) for the shadow H6738 to go down H5186 (8800) ten H6235 degrees H4609: nay, but let the shadow H6738 return H7725 (8799) backward H0322 ten H6235 degrees H4609.
020:011 And Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 cried H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068: and he brought H7725 (8686) the shadow H6738 ten H6235 degrees H4609 backward H0322, by H4609 which it had gone down H3381 (8804) in the dial H4609 of Ahaz H0271.
020:012 At that time H6256 Berodachbaladan H1255, the son H1121 of Baladan H1081, king H4428 of Babylon H0894, sent H7971 (8804) letters H5612 and a present H4503 unto Hezekiah H2396: for he had heard H8085 (8804) that Hezekiah H2396 had been sick H2470 (8804).
020:013 And Hezekiah H2396 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto them, and shewed H7200 (8686) them all the house H1004 of his precious things H5238, the silver H3701, and the gold H2091, and the spices H1314, and the precious H2896 ointment H8081, and [all] the house H1004 of his armour H3627, and all that was found H4672 (8738) in his treasures H0214: there was nothing H1697 in his house H1004, nor in all his dominion H4475, that Hezekiah H2396 shewed H7200 (8689) them not.
020:014 Then came H0935 (8799) Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 unto king H4428 Hezekiah H2396, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, What said H0559 (8804) these men H0582? and from whence H0370 came H0935 (8799) they unto thee? And Hezekiah H2396 said H0559 (8799), They are come H0935 (8804) from a far H7350 country H0776, [even] from Babylon H0894.
020:015 And he said H0559 (8799), What have they seen H7200 (8804) in thine house H1004? And Hezekiah H2396 answered H0559 (8799), All [the things] that [are] in mine house H1004 have they seen H7200 (8804): there is nothing H1697 among my treasures H0214 that I have not shewed H7200 (8689) them.
020:016 And Isaiah H3470 said H0559 (8799) unto Hezekiah H2396, Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
020:017 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), that all that [is] in thine house H1004, and that which thy fathers H0001 have laid up in store H0686 (8804) unto this day H3117, shall be carried H5375 (8738) into Babylon H0894: nothing H1697 shall be left H3498 (8735), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
020:018 And of thy sons H1121 that shall issue H3318 (8799) from thee, which thou shalt beget H3205 (8686), shall they take away H3947 (8799); and they shall be eunuchs H5631 in the palace H1964 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
020:019 Then said H0559 (8799) Hezekiah H2396 unto Isaiah H3470, Good H2896 [is] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which thou hast spoken H1696 (8765). And he said H0559 (8799), [Is it] not [good], if peace H7965 and truth H0571 be in my days H3117?
020:020 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Hezekiah H2396, and all his might H1369, and how he made H6213 (8804) a pool H1295, and a conduit H8585, and brought H0935 (8686) water H4325 into the city H5892, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
020:021 And Hezekiah H2396 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001: and Manasseh H4519 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
021:001 ¶ Manasseh H4519 [was] twelve H8147 H6240 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) fifty H2572 and five H2568 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Hephzibah H2657.
021:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, after the abominations H8441 of the heathen H1471, whom the LORD H3068 cast out H3423 (8689) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
021:003 For he built up H1129 (8799) again H7725 (8799) the high places H1116 which Hezekiah H2396 his father H0001 had destroyed H0006 (8765); and he reared up H6965 (8686) altars H4196 for Baal H1168, and made H6213 (8799) a grove H0842, as did H6213 (8804) Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478; and worshipped H7812 (8691) all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, and served H5647 (8799) them.
021:004 And he built H1129 (8804) altars H4196 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, of which the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804), In Jerusalem H3389 will I put H7760 (8799) my name H8034.
021:005 And he built H1129 (8799) altars H4196 for all the host H6635 of heaven H8064 in the two H8147 courts H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
021:006 And he made his son H1121 pass H5674 (8689) through the fire H0784, and observed times H6049 (8782), and used enchantments H5172 (8765), and dealt H6213 (8804) with familiar spirits H0178 and wizards H3049: he wrought H6213 (8800) much H7235 (8689) wickedness H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, to provoke [him] to anger H3707 (8687).
021:007 And he set H7760 (8799) a graven image H6459 of the grove H0842 that he had made H6213 (8804) in the house H1004, of which the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) to David H1732, and to Solomon H8010 his son H1121, In this house H1004, and in Jerusalem H3389, which I have chosen H0977 (8804) out of all tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, will I put H7760 (8799) my name H8034 for ever H5769:
021:008 Neither will I make the feet H7272 of Israel H3478 move H5110 (8687) any more H3254 (8686) out of the land H0127 which I gave H5414 (8804) their fathers H0001; only if they will observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) according to all that I have commanded H6680 (8765) them, and according to all the law H8451 that my servant H5650 Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765) them.
021:009 But they hearkened H8085 (8804) not: and Manasseh H4519 seduced H8582 (8686) them to do H6213 (8800) more evil H7451 than did the nations H1471 whom the LORD H3068 destroyed H8045 (8689) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
021:010 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) by H3027 his servants H5650 the prophets H5030, saying H0559 (8800),
021:011 Because Manasseh H4519 king H4428 of Judah H3063 hath done H6213 (8804) these abominations H8441, [and] hath done wickedly H7489 (8689) above all that the Amorites H0567 did H6213 (8804), which [were] before H6440 him, and hath made Judah H3063 also to sin H2398 (8686) with his idols H1544:
021:012 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Behold, I [am] bringing H0935 (8688) [such] evil H7451 upon Jerusalem H3389 and Judah H3063, that whosoever heareth H8085 (8802) of it, both H8147 his ears H0241 shall tingle H6750 (8799).
021:013 And I will stretch H5186 (8804) over Jerusalem H3389 the line H6957 of Samaria H8111, and the plummet H4949 of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: and I will wipe H4229 (8804) Jerusalem H3389 as [a man] wipeth H4229 (8799) a dish H6747, wiping H4229 (8804) [it], and turning H2015 (8804) [it] upside down H6440.
021:014 And I will forsake H5203 (8804) the remnant H7611 of mine inheritance H5159, and deliver H5414 (8804) them into the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802); and they shall become a prey H0957 and a spoil H4933 to all their enemies H0341 (8802);
021:015 Because they have done H6213 (8804) [that which was] evil H7451 in my sight H5869, and have provoked H4480 me to anger H3707 (8688), since the day H3117 their fathers H0001 came forth H3318 (8804) out of Egypt H4714, even unto this day H3117.
021:016 Moreover Manasseh H4519 shed H8210 (8804) innocent H5355 blood H1818 very H3966 much H7235 (8687), till he had filled H4390 (8765) Jerusalem H3389 from one end H6310 to another H6310; beside his sin H2403 wherewith he made Judah H3063 to sin H2398 (8689), in doing H6213 (8800) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
021:017 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Manasseh H4519, and all that he did H6213 (8804), and his sin H2403 that he sinned H2398 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
021:018 And Manasseh H4519 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) in the garden H1588 of his own house H1004, in the garden H1588 of Uzza H5798: and Amon H0526 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
021:019 Amon H0526 [was] twenty H6242 and two H8147 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) two H8147 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Meshullemeth H4922, the daughter H1323 of Haruz H2743 of Jotbah H3192.
021:020 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, as his father H0001 Manasseh H4519 did H6213 (8804).
021:021 And he walked H3212 (8799) in all the way H1870 that his father H0001 walked in H1980 (8804), and served H5647 (8799) the idols H1544 that his father H0001 served H5647 (8804), and worshipped H7812 (8691) them:
021:022 And he forsook H5800 (8799) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of his fathers H0001, and walked H1980 (8804) not in the way H1870 of the LORD H3068.
021:023 And the servants H5650 of Amon H0526 conspired H7194 (8799) against him, and slew H4191 (8686) the king H4428 in his own house H1004.
021:024 And the people H5971 of the land H0776 slew H5221 (8686) all them that had conspired H7194 (8802) against king H4428 Amon H0526; and the people H5971 of the land H0776 made Josiah H2977 his son H1121 king H4427 (8686) in his stead.
021:025 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Amon H0526 which he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
021:026 And he was buried H6912 (8799) in his sepulchre H6900 in the garden H1588 of Uzza H5798: and Josiah H2977 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
022:001 ¶ Josiah H2977 [was] eight H8083 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) thirty H7970 and one H0259 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Jedidah H3040, the daughter H1323 of Adaiah H5718 of Boscath H1218.
022:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and walked H3212 (8799) in all the way H1870 of David H1732 his father H0001, and turned not aside H5493 (8804) to the right hand H3225 or to the left H8040.
022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Josiah H2977, [that] the king H4428 sent H7971 (8804) Shaphan H8227 the son H1121 of Azaliah H0683, the son H1121 of Meshullam H4918, the scribe H5608 (8802), to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
022:004 Go up H5927 (8798) to Hilkiah H2518 the high H1419 priest H3548, that he may sum H8552 (8686) the silver H3701 which is brought H0935 (8716) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, which the keepers H8104 (8802) of the door H5592 have gathered H0622 (8804) of the people H5971:
022:005 And let them deliver H5414 (8799) it into the hand H3027 of the doers H6213 (8802) of the work H4399, that have the oversight H6485 (8716) of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and let them give H5414 (8799) it to the doers H6213 (8802) of the work H4399 which [is] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, to repair H2388 (8763) the breaches H0919 of the house H1004,
022:006 Unto carpenters H2796, and builders H1129 (8802), and masons H1443 (8802), and to buy H7069 (8800) timber H6086 and hewn H4274 stone H0068 to repair H2388 (8763) the house H1004.
022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made H2803 (8735) with them of the money H3701 that was delivered H5414 (8737) into their hand H3027, because they dealt H6213 (8802) faithfully H0530.
022:008 And Hilkiah H2518 the high H1419 priest H3548 said H0559 (8799) unto Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802), I have found H4672 (8804) the book H5612 of the law H8451 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. And Hilkiah H2518 gave H5414 (8799) the book H5612 to Shaphan H8227, and he read H7121 (8799) it.
022:009 And Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802) came H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, and brought H7725 the king H4428 word H1697 again H7725 (8686), and said H0559 (8799), Thy servants H5650 have gathered H5413 (8689) the money H3701 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004, and have delivered H5414 (8799) it into the hand H3027 of them that do H6213 (8802) the work H4399, that have the oversight H6485 (8716) of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
022:010 And Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802) shewed H5046 (8686) the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548 hath delivered H5414 (8804) me a book H5612. And Shaphan H8227 read H7121 (8799) it before H6440 the king H4428.
022:011 And it came to pass, when the king H4428 had heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of the book H5612 of the law H8451, that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899.
022:012 And the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548, and Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, and Achbor H5907 the son H1121 of Michaiah H4320, and Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Asahiah H6222 a servant H5650 of the king’s H4428, saying H0559 (8800),
022:013 Go H3212 (8798) ye, enquire H1875 (8798) of the LORD H3068 for me, and for the people H5971, and for all Judah H3063, concerning the words H1697 of this book H5612 that is found H4672 (8737): for great H1419 [is] the wrath H2534 of the LORD H3068 that is kindled H3341 (8738) against us, because our fathers H0001 have not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto the words H1697 of this book H5612, to do H6213 (8800) according unto all that which is written H3789 (8803) concerning us.
022:014 So Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548, and Ahikam H0296, and Achbor H5907, and Shaphan H8227, and Asahiah H6222, went H3212 (8799) unto Huldah H2468 the prophetess H5031, the wife H0802 of Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Tikvah H8616, the son H1121 of Harhas H2745, keeper H8104 (8802) of the wardrobe H0899; (now she dwelt H3427 (8802) in Jerusalem H3389 in the college H4932;) and they communed H1696 (8762) with her.
022:015 And she said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Tell H0559 (8798) the man H0376 that sent H7971 (8804) you to me,
022:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon this place H4725, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, [even] all the words H1697 of the book H5612 which the king H4428 of Judah H3063 hath read H7121 (8804):
022:017 Because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and have burned incense H6999 (8762) unto other H0312 gods H0430, that they might provoke me to anger H3707 (8687) with all the works H4639 of their hands H3027; therefore my wrath H2534 shall be kindled H3341 (8738) against this place H4725, and shall not be quenched H3518 (8799).
022:018 But to the king H4428 of Judah H3063 which sent H7971 (8802) you to enquire H1875 (8800) of the LORD H3068, thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) to him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, [As touching] the words H1697 which thou hast heard H8085 (8804);
022:019 Because thine heart H3824 was tender H7401 (8804), and thou hast humbled H3665 (8735) thyself before H6440 the LORD H3068, when thou heardest H8085 (8800) what I spake H1696 (8765) against this place H4725, and against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, that they should become a desolation H8047 and a curse H7045, and hast rent H7167 (8799) thy clothes H0899, and wept H1058 (8799) before H6440 me; I also have heard H8085 (8804) [thee], saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather H0622 (8802) thee unto thy fathers H0001, and thou shalt be gathered H0622 (8738) into thy grave H6913 in peace H7965; and thine eyes H5869 shall not see H7200 (8799) all the evil H7451 which I will bring H0935 (8688) upon this place H4725. And they brought H7725 the king H4428 word H1697 again H7725 (8686).
023:001 ¶ And the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799), and they gathered H0622 (8799) unto him all the elders H2205 of Judah H3063 and of Jerusalem H3389.
023:002 And the king H4428 went up H5927 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and all the men H0376 of Judah H3063 and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 with him, and the priests H3548, and the prophets H5030, and all the people H5971, both small H6996 and great H1419: and he read H7121 (8799) in their ears H0241 all the words H1697 of the book H5612 of the covenant H1285 which was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
023:003 And the king H4428 stood H5975 (8799) by a pillar H5982, and made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 before H6440 the LORD H3068, to walk H3212 (8800) after H0310 the LORD H3068, and to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687 and his testimonies H5715 and his statutes H2708 with all [their] heart H3820 and all [their] soul H5315, to perform H6965 (8687) the words H1697 of this covenant H1285 that were written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612. And all the people H5971 stood H5975 (8799) to the covenant H1285.
023:004 And the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Hilkiah H2518 the high H1419 priest H3548, and the priests H3548 of the second order H4932, and the keepers H8104 (8802) of the door H5592, to bring forth H3318 (8687) out of the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068 all the vessels H3627 that were made H6213 (8803) for Baal H1168, and for the grove H0842, and for all the host H6635 of heaven H8064: and he burned H8313 (8799) them without H2351 Jerusalem H3389 in the fields H7709 of Kidron H6939, and carried H5375 (8804) the ashes H6083 of them unto Bethel H1008.
023:005 And he put down H7673 (8689) the idolatrous priests H3649, whom the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 had ordained H5414 (8804) to burn incense H6999 (8762) in the high places H1116 in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the places round about H4524 Jerusalem H3389; them also that burned incense H6999 (8764) unto Baal H1168, to the sun H8121, and to the moon H3394, and to the planets H4208, and to all the host H6635 of heaven H8064.
023:006 And he brought out H3318 (8686) the grove H0842 from the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, without H2351 Jerusalem H3389, unto the brook H5158 Kidron H6939, and burned H8313 (8799) it at the brook H5158 Kidron H6939, and stamped [it] small H1854 (8686) to powder H6083, and cast H7993 (8686) the powder H6083 thereof upon the graves H6913 of the children H1121 of the people H5971.
023:007 And he brake down H5422 (8799) the houses H1004 of the sodomites H6945, that [were] by the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, where the women H0802 wove H0707 (8802) hangings H1004 for the grove H0842.
023:008 And he brought H0935 (8686) all the priests H3548 out of the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and defiled H2930 (8762) the high places H1116 where the priests H3548 had burned incense H6999 (8765), from Geba H1387 to Beersheba H0884, and brake down H5422 (8804) the high places H1116 of the gates H8179 that [were] in the entering in H6607 of the gate H8179 of Joshua H3091 the governor H8269 of the city H5892, which [were] on a man’s H0376 left hand H8040 at the gate H8179 of the city H5892.
023:009 Nevertheless the priests H3548 of the high places H1116 came not up H5927 (8799) to the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 in Jerusalem H3389, but they did eat H0398 (8804) of the unleavened bread H4682 among H8432 their brethren H0251.
023:010 And he defiled H2930 (8765) Topheth H8612, which [is] in the valley H1516 of the children H1121 (8675) H1121 of Hinnom H2011, that no man H0376 might make his son H1121 or his daughter H1323 to pass through H5674 (8687) the fire H0784 to Molech H4432.
023:011 And he took away H7673 (8686) the horses H5483 that the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 had given H5414 (8804) to the sun H8121, at the entering in H0935 (8800) of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, by the chamber H3957 of Nathanmelech H5419 the chamberlain H5631, which [was] in the suburbs H6503, and burned H8313 (8804) the chariots H4818 of the sun H8121 with fire H0784.
023:012 And the altars H4196 that [were] on the top H1406 of the upper chamber H5944 of Ahaz H0271, which the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 had made H6213 (8804), and the altars H4196 which Manasseh H4519 had made H6213 (8804) in the two H8147 courts H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, did the king H4428 beat down H5422 (8804), and brake [them] down H7323 (8799) from thence, and cast H7993 (8689) the dust H6083 of them into the brook H5158 Kidron H6939.
023:013 And the high places H1116 that [were] before H6440 Jerusalem H3389, which [were] on the right hand H3225 of the mount H2022 of corruption H4889, which Solomon H8010 the king H4428 of Israel H3478 had builded H1129 (8804) for Ashtoreth H6253 the abomination H8251 of the Zidonians H6722, and for Chemosh H3645 the abomination H8251 of the Moabites H4124, and for Milcom H4445 the abomination H8441 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, did the king H4428 defile H2930 (8765).
023:014 And he brake in pieces H7665 (8765) the images H4676, and cut down H3772 (8799) the groves H0842, and filled H4390 (8762) their places H4725 with the bones H6106 of men H0120.
023:015 Moreover the altar H4196 that [was] at Bethel H1008, [and] the high place H1116 which Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who made Israel H3478 to sin H2398 (8689), had made H6213 (8804), both that altar H4196 and the high place H1116 he brake down H5422 (8804), and burned H8313 (8799) the high place H1116, [and] stamped H1854 (8689) [it] small to powder H6083, and burned H8313 (8804) the grove H0842.
023:016 And as Josiah H2977 turned H6437 (8799) himself, he spied H7200 (8799) the sepulchres H6913 that [were] there in the mount H2022, and sent H7971 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) the bones H6106 out of the sepulchres H6913, and burned H8313 (8799) [them] upon the altar H4196, and polluted H2930 (8762) it, according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which the man H0376 of God H0430 proclaimed H7121 (8804), who proclaimed H7121 (8804) these words H1697.
023:017 Then he said H0559 (8799), What title H6725 [is] that H1975 that I see H7200 (8802)? And the men H0582 of the city H5892 told H0559 (8799) him, [It is] the sepulchre H6913 of the man H0376 of God H0430, which came H0935 (8804) from Judah H3063, and proclaimed H7121 (8799) these things H1697 that thou hast done H6213 (8804) against the altar H4196 of Bethel H1008.
023:018 And he said H0559 (8799), Let him alone H3240 (8685); let no man H0376 move H5128 (8686) his bones H6106. So they let his bones H6106 alone H4422 (8762), with the bones H6106 of the prophet H5030 that came out H0935 (8804) of Samaria H8111.
023:019 And all the houses H1004 also of the high places H1116 that [were] in the cities H5892 of Samaria H8111, which the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 had made H6213 (8804) to provoke [the LORD] to anger H3707 (8687), Josiah H2977 took away H5493 (8689), and did H6213 (8799) to them according to all the acts H4639 that he had done H6213 (8804) in Bethel H1008.
023:020 And he slew H2076 (8799) all the priests H3548 of the high places H1116 that [were] there upon the altars H4196, and burned H8313 (8799) men’s H0120 bones H6106 upon them, and returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
023:021 And the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Keep H6213 (8798) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430, as [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of this covenant H1285.
023:022 Surely there was not holden H6213 (8738) such a passover H6453 from the days H3117 of the judges H8199 (8802) that judged H8199 (8804) Israel H3478, nor in all the days H3117 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, nor of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063;
023:023 But in the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Josiah H2977, [wherein] this passover H6453 was holden H6213 (8738) to the LORD H3068 in Jerusalem H3389.
023:024 Moreover the [workers with] familiar spirits H0178, and the wizards H3049, and the images H8655, and the idols H1544, and all the abominations H8251 that were spied H7200 (8738) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063 and in Jerusalem H3389, did Josiah H2977 put away H1197 (8765), that he might perform H6965 (8687) the words H1697 of the law H8451 which were written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 that Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548 found H4672 (8804) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
023:025 And like unto him was there no king H4428 before H6440 him, that turned H7725 (8804) to the LORD H3068 with all his heart H3824, and with all his soul H5315, and with all his might H3966, according to all the law H8451 of Moses H4872; neither after H0310 him arose H6965 (8804) there [any] like him.
023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD H3068 turned H7725 (8804) not from the fierceness H2740 of his great H1419 wrath H0639, wherewith his anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8804) against Judah H3063, because of all the provocations H3708 that Manasseh H4519 had provoked H3707 (8689) him withal.
023:027 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), I will remove H5493 (8686) Judah H3063 also out of my sight H6440, as I have removed H5493 (8689) Israel H3478, and will cast off H3988 (8804) this city H5892 Jerusalem H3389 which I have chosen H0977 (8804), and the house H1004 of which I said H0559 (8804), My name H8034 shall be there.
023:028 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Josiah H2977, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
023:029 In his days H3117 Pharaohnechoh H6549 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 went up H5927 (8804) against the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 to the river H5104 Euphrates H6578: and king H4428 Josiah H2977 went H3212 (8799) against H7125 (8800) him; and he slew H4191 (8686) him at Megiddo H4023, when he had seen H7200 (8800) him.
023:030 And his servants H5650 carried him in a chariot H7392 (8686) dead H4191 (8801) from Megiddo H4023, and brought H0935 (8686) him to Jerusalem H3389, and buried H6912 (8799) him in his own sepulchre H6900. And the people H5971 of the land H0776 took H3947 (8799) Jehoahaz H3059 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977, and anointed H4886 (8799) him, and made him king H4427 (8686) in his father’s H0001 stead.
023:031 Jehoahaz H3059 [was] twenty H6242 and three H7969 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800); and he reigned H4427 (8804) three H7969 months H2320 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Hamutal H2537, the daughter H1323 of Jeremiah H3414 of Libnah H3841.
023:032 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his fathers H0001 had done H6213 (8804).
023:033 And Pharaohnechoh H6549 put him in bands H0631 (8799) at Riblah H7247 in the land H0776 of Hamath H2574, that he might not reign H4427 (8800) in Jerusalem H3389; and put H5414 (8799) the land H0776 to a tribute H6066 of an hundred H3967 talents H3603 of silver H3701, and a talent H3603 of gold H2091.
023:034 And Pharaohnechoh H6549 made Eliakim H0471 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4427 (8686) in the room of Josiah H2977 his father H0001, and turned H5437 (8686) his name H8034 to Jehoiakim H3079, and took H3947 Jehoahaz H3059 away H3947 (8804): and he came H0935 (8799) to Egypt H4714, and died H4191 (8799) there.
023:035 And Jehoiakim H3079 gave H5414 (8804) the silver H3701 and the gold H2091 to Pharaoh H6547; but he taxed H6186 (8689) the land H0776 to give H5414 (8800) the money H3701 according to the commandment H6310 of Pharaoh H6547: he exacted H5065 (8804) the silver H3701 and the gold H2091 of the people H5971 of the land H0776, of every one H0376 according to his taxation H6187, to give H5414 (8800) [it] unto Pharaohnechoh H6549.
023:036 Jehoiakim H3079 [was] twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800); and he reigned H4427 (8804) eleven H0259 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Zebudah H2080, the daughter H1323 of Pedaiah H6305 of Rumah H7316.
023:037 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his fathers H0001 had done H6213 (8804).
024:001 ¶ In his days H3117 Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came up H5927 (8804), and Jehoiakim H3079 became his servant H5650 three H7969 years H8141: then he turned H7725 (8799) and rebelled H4775 (8799) against him.
024:002 And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8762) against him bands H1416 of the Chaldees H3778, and bands H1416 of the Syrians H0758, and bands H1416 of the Moabites H4124, and bands H1416 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and sent H7971 (8762) them against Judah H3063 to destroy H0006 (8687) it, according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he spake H1696 (8765) by H3027 his servants H5650 the prophets H5030.
024:003 Surely at the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 came [this] upon Judah H3063, to remove H5493 (8687) [them] out of his sight H6440, for the sins H2403 of Manasseh H4519, according to all that he did H6213 (8804);
024:004 And also for the innocent H5355 blood H1818 that he shed H8210 (8804): for he filled H4390 (8762) Jerusalem H3389 with innocent H5355 blood H1818; which the LORD H3068 would H0014 (8804) not pardon H5545 (8800).
024:005 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehoiakim H3079, and all that he did H6213 (8804), [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063?
024:006 So Jehoiakim H3079 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001: and Jehoiachin H3078 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
024:007 And the king H4428 of Egypt H4714 came H3318 (8800) not again H3254 (8689) any more out of his land H0776: for the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had taken H3947 (8804) from the river H5158 of Egypt H4714 unto the river H5104 Euphrates H6578 all that pertained to the king H4428 of Egypt H4714.
024:008 Jehoiachin H3078 [was] eighteen H8083 H6240 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) in Jerusalem H3389 three H7969 months H2320. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Nehushta H5179, the daughter H1323 of Elnathan H0494 of Jerusalem H3389.
024:009 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his father H0001 had done H6213 (8804).
024:010 At that time H6256 the servants H5650 of Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came up H5927 (8804) against Jerusalem H3389, and the city H5892 was besieged H0935 (8799) H4692.
024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came H0935 (8799) against the city H5892, and his servants H5650 did besiege H6696 (8802) it.
024:012 And Jehoiachin H3078 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 went out H3318 (8799) to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, he, and his mother H0517, and his servants H5650, and his princes H8269, and his officers H5631: and the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 took H3947 (8799) him in the eighth H8083 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800).
024:013 And he carried out H3318 (8686) thence all the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and cut in pieces H7112 (8762) all the vessels H3627 of gold H2091 which Solomon H8010 king H4428 of Israel H3478 had made H6213 (8804) in the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, as the LORD H3068 had said H1696 (8765).
024:014 And he carried away H1540 (8689) all Jerusalem H3389, and all the princes H8269, and all the mighty men H1368 of valour H2428, [even] ten H6235 thousand H0505 captives H1540 (8802), and all the craftsmen H2796 and smiths H4525: none remained H7604 (8738), save H2108 the poorest sort H1803 of the people H5971 of the land H0776.
024:015 And he carried away H1540 (8686) Jehoiachin H3078 to Babylon H0894, and the king’s H4428 mother H0517, and the king’s H4428 wives H0802, and his officers H5631, and the mighty H0352 (8675) H0193 of the land H0776, [those] carried H3212 (8689) he into captivity H1473 from Jerusalem H3389 to Babylon H0894.
024:016 And all the men H0582 of might H2428, [even] seven H7651 thousand H0505, and craftsmen H2796 and smiths H4525 a thousand H0505, all [that were] strong H1368 [and] apt H6213 (8802) for war H4421, even them the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 brought H0935 (8686) captive H1473 to Babylon H0894.
024:017 And the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 made Mattaniah H4983 his father’s brother H1730 king H4427 (8686) in his stead, and changed H5437 (8686) his name H8034 to Zedekiah H6667.
024:018 Zedekiah H6667 [was] twenty H6242 and one H0259 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) eleven H0259 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Hamutal H2537, the daughter H1323 of Jeremiah H3414 of Libnah H3841.
024:019 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that Jehoiakim H3079 had done H6213 (8804).
024:020 For through the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 it came to pass in Jerusalem H3389 and Judah H3063, until he had cast them out H7993 (8689) from his presence H6440, that Zedekiah H6667 rebelled H4775 (8799) against the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
025:001 ¶ And it came to pass in the ninth H8671 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800), in the tenth H6224 month H2320, in the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, [that] Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came H0935 (8804), he, and all his host H2428, against Jerusalem H3389, and pitched H2583 (8799) against it; and they built H1129 (8799) forts H1785 against it round about H5439.
025:002 And the city H5892 was besieged H0935 (8799) H4692 unto the eleventh H6249 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Zedekiah H6667.
025:003 And on the ninth H8672 [day] of the [fourth] month H2320 the famine H7458 prevailed H2388 (8799) in the city H5892, and there was no bread H3899 for the people H5971 of the land H0776.
025:004 And the city H5892 was broken up H1234 (8735), and all the men H0582 of war H4421 [fled] by night H3915 by the way H1870 of the gate H8179 between two walls H2346, which [is] by the king’s H4428 garden H1588: (now the Chaldees H3778 [were] against the city H5892 round about H5439:) and [the king] went H3212 (8799) the way H1870 toward the plain H6160.
025:005 And the army H2428 of the Chaldees H3778 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 the king H4428, and overtook H5381 (8686) him in the plains H6160 of Jericho H3405: and all his army H2428 were scattered H6327 (8738) from him.
025:006 So they took H8610 (8799) the king H4428, and brought him up H5927 (8686) to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 to Riblah H7247; and they gave H1696 (8762) judgment H4941 upon him.
025:007 And they slew H7819 (8804) the sons H1121 of Zedekiah H6667 before his eyes H5869, and put out H5786 (8765) the eyes H5869 of Zedekiah H6667, and bound H0631 (8799) him with fetters H5178 of brass H5178, and carried H0935 (8686) him to Babylon H0894.
025:008 And in the fifth H2549 month H2320, on the seventh H7651 [day] of the month H2320, which [is] the nineteenth H8672 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of king H4428 Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, came H0935 (8804) Nebuzaradan H5018, captain H7227 of the guard H2876, a servant H5650 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, unto Jerusalem H3389:
025:009 And he burnt H8313 (8799) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the king’s H4428 house H1004, and all the houses H1004 of Jerusalem H3389, and every great H1419 [man’s] house H1004 burnt H8313 (8804) he with fire H0784.
025:010 And all the army H2428 of the Chaldees H3778, that [were with] the captain H7227 of the guard H2876, brake down H5422 (8804) the walls H2346 of Jerusalem H3389 round about H5439.
025:011 Now the rest H3499 of the people H5971 [that were] left H7604 (8737) in the city H5892, and the fugitives H5307 (8802) that fell away H5307 (8804) to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, with the remnant H3499 of the multitude H1995, did Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 carry away H1540 (8689).
025:012 But the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 left H7604 (8689) of the poor H1803 of the land H0776 [to be] vinedressers H3755 and husbandmen H3009 (8802) (8675) H1461 (8801).
025:013 And the pillars H5982 of brass H5178 that [were] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the bases H4350, and the brasen H5178 sea H3220 that [was] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, did the Chaldees H3778 break in pieces H7665 (8765), and carried H5375 (8799) the brass H5178 of them to Babylon H0894.
025:014 And the pots H5518, and the shovels H3257, and the snuffers H4212, and the spoons H3709, and all the vessels H3627 of brass H5178 wherewith they ministered H8334 (8762), took they away H3947 (8804).
025:015 And the firepans H4289, and the bowls H4219, [and] such things as [were] of gold H2091, [in] gold H2091, and of silver H3701, [in] silver H3701, the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took away H3947 (8804).
025:016 The two H8147 pillars H5982, one H0259 sea H3220, and the bases H4350 which Solomon H8010 had made H6213 (8804) for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068; the brass H5178 of all these vessels H3627 was without H3808 weight H4948.
025:017 The height H6967 of the one H0259 pillar H5982 [was] eighteen H8083 H6240 cubits H0520, and the chapiter H3805 upon it [was] brass H5178: and the height H6967 of the chapiter H3805 three H7969 cubits H0520; and the wreathen work H7639, and pomegranates H7416 upon the chapiter H3805 round about H5439, all of brass H5178: and like unto these had the second H8145 pillar H5982 with wreathen work H7639.
025:018 And the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took H3947 (8799) Seraiah H8304 the chief H7218 priest H3548, and Zephaniah H6846 the second H4932 priest H3548, and the three H7969 keepers H8104 (8802) of the door H5592:
025:019 And out of the city H5892 he took H3947 (8804) an H0259 officer H5631 that was set H6496 over the men H0582 of war H4421, and five H2568 men H0582 of them that were H7200 (8802) in the king’s H4428 presence H6440, which were found H4672 (8738) in the city H5892, and the principal H8269 scribe H5608 (8802) of the host H6635, which mustered H6633 (8688) the people H5971 of the land H0776, and threescore H8346 men H0376 of the people H5971 of the land H0776 [that were] found H4672 (8737) in the city H5892:
025:020 And Nebuzaradan H5018 captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took H3947 (8799) these, and brought H3212 (8686) them to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 to Riblah H7247:
025:021 And the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 smote H5221 (8686) them, and slew H4191 (8686) them at Riblah H7247 in the land H0776 of Hamath H2574. So Judah H3063 was carried away H1540 (8799) out of their land H0127.
025:022 And [as for] the people H5971 that remained H7604 (8737) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063, whom Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had left H7604 (8689), even over them he made Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296, the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, ruler H6485 (8686).
025:023 And when all the captains H8269 of the armies H2428, they and their men H0582, heard H8085 (8799) that the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had made Gedaliah H1436 governor H6485 (8689), there came H0935 (8799) to Gedaliah H1436 to Mizpah H4709, even Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, and Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Careah H7143, and Seraiah H8304 the son H1121 of Tanhumeth H8576 the Netophathite H5200, and Jaazaniah H2970 the son H1121 of a Maachathite H4602, they and their men H0582.
025:024 And Gedaliah H1436 sware H7650 (8735) to them, and to their men H0582, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Fear H3372 (8799) not to be the servants H5650 of the Chaldees H3778: dwell H3427 (8798) in the land H0776, and serve H5647 (8798) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894; and it shall be well H3190 (8799) with you.
025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh H7637 month H2320, that Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, the son H1121 of Elishama H0476, of the seed H2233 royal H4410, came H0935 (8804), and ten H6235 men H0582 with him, and smote H5221 (8686) Gedaliah H1436, that he died H4191 (8799), and the Jews H3064 and the Chaldees H3778 that were with him at Mizpah H4709.
025:026 And all the people H5971, both small H6996 and great H1419, and the captains H8269 of the armies H2428, arose H6965 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Egypt H4714: for they were afraid H3372 (8804) of H6440 the Chaldees H3778.
025:027 And it came to pass in the seven H7651 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of the captivity H1546 of Jehoiachin H3078 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the twelfth H8147 H6240 month H2320, on the seven H7651 and twentieth H6242 [day] of the month H2320, [that] Evilmerodach H0192 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 in the year H8141 that he began to reign H4427 (8800) did lift up H5375 (8804) the head H7218 of Jehoiachin H3078 king H4428 of Judah H3063 out of prison H1004 H3608;
025:028 And he spake H1696 (8762) kindly H2896 to him, and set H5414 (8799) his throne H3678 above the throne H3678 of the kings H4428 that [were] with him in Babylon H0894;
025:029 And changed H8132 (8765) his prison H3608 garments H0899: and he did eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899 continually H8548 before H6440 him all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
025:030 And his allowance H0737 [was] a continual H8548 allowance H0737 given H5414 (8738) him of the king H4428, a daily H3117 H3117 rate H1697 for every day H3117, all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
